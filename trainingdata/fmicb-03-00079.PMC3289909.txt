Antimycotic chemosensitization and its mode of action are of growing interest. Currently,
use of antifungal agents in agriculture and medicine has a number of obstacles. Foremost
of these is development of resistance or cross-resistance to one or more antifungal agents.
The generally high expense and negative impact, or side effects, associated with antifungal
agents are two further issues of concern. Collectively, these problems are exacerbated by
efforts to control resistant strains, which can evolve into a treadmill of higher dosages for
longer periods.This cycle in turn, inﬂates cost of treatment, dramatically. A further problem
is stagnation in development of new and effective antifungal agents, especially for treat-
ment of human mycoses. Efforts to overcome some of these issues have involved using
combinations of available antimycotics (e.g., combination therapy for invasive mycoses).
However, this approach has had inconsistent success and is often associated with a marked
increase in negative side effects. Chemosensitization by natural compounds to increase
effectiveness of commercial antimycotics is a somewhat new approach to dealing with
the aforementioned problems. The potential for safe natural products to improve antifun-
gal activity has been observed for over three decades. Chemosensitizing agents possess
antifungal activity, but at insufﬁcient levels to serve as antimycotics, alone. Their main
function is to disrupt fungal stress response, destabilize the structural integrity of cellular
and vacuolar membranes or stimulate production of reactive oxygen species, augmenting
oxidative stress and apoptosis. Use of safe chemosensitizing agents has potential beneﬁt
to both agriculture and medicine. When co-applied with a commercial antifungal agent, an
additive or synergistic interaction may occur, augmenting antifungal efﬁcacy.This augmen-
tation, in turn, lowers effective dosages, costs, negative side effects and, in some cases,
countermands resistance.

INTRODUCTION
The term “chemosensitization” was originally introduced as a
strategy to counter the development of resistance in tumor cells to
anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. Simply put, chemosensitiza-
tion in cancer therapy involves use of a chemical that renders can-
cer cells more sensitive to a chemotherapeutic agent. Development
of resistance in cancer cells to anticancer drugs involved mutations
in target genes, up-regulation or over-expression of genes control-
ling efﬂux pumps, production of enzymes that “detoxiﬁed” the
drugs, and DNA repair (Shabbits et al., 2003). Employment of a
chemosensitizer results in lowering dosages of cytotoxic anticancer
drugs, overcoming chemo-resistance by cancer cells to these drugs,
avoiding toxicity to non-target cells and lowering the extreme
negative side effects to the patient associated with anticancer drugs.
The mechanisms of resistance to anticancer chemotherapeutic
agents are almost completely parallel to those developed by fungal
pathogens against antifungal agents. As in the advancement for
cancer treatment, chemosensitizers may be especially useful for
improving antimycotic chemotherapy against human mycoses or
strategies to control plant fungal pathogens. Use of chemosensi-
tizers could facilitate overcoming resistance to currently available

antimycotics, without increasing risks of negative side effects. Such
chemosensitizers could function by debilitating, or stressing the
fungus so that it becomes more vulnerable to commercial agents.
A fundamental characteristic of a chemosensitizer, however, is that
while it contributes to augmenting the efﬁcacy of drug activity,
whether for treatment of cancer or mycoses, it does not present,
or only minimally presents, additional toxic side effects.

Chemosensitizing agents, alone, may have some nominal anti-
fungal activity, but most often an order of magnitude less than
that of commercial antimycotics; which generally function at the
micromolar level, or less. The chemosensitizing agents, on the
other hand, function mainly as synergists that affect the tar-
get pathogen in such a way that it becomes more vulnerable
(chemosensitized) to the commercial antimycotic agent. With
chemosensitization, effective dosage levels of the commercial
product can be signiﬁcantly lowered, perhaps 10-fold or more.
Additionally, chemosensitization may cause strains that are resis-
tant to an antimycotic to revert to becoming susceptible, or at least
more sensitive to treatment.

There are laboratories, worldwide, performing research on
chemosensitizing agents to boost antifungal activity. Yet, there

has been a general unawareness of each other’s activities. This
was, and still is evident, by the fact that many of the publications
on chemosensitization of antimycotics have not been citing each
other’s papers in the ﬁeld. We include ourselves in this oversight.
Recent reviews on synergism of antibiotics by natural products
mainly entailed antibacterial research (Hemaiswarya et al., 2008;
Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009). These reviews did cite eight
papers, however, on synergism of antimycotics, speciﬁcally. There
are now well over 70 papers on chemosensitization of antimycotics
cited in this review. Many of these papers have been published
only within the past few years. Interest in this strategy is growing
immensely as genetic tools have facilitated the discovery of stress
response networks to serve as targets to weaken fungal defenses,
whether structural or biochemical.

This review begins with an encapsulated overview of fungal
diseases and development of antimycotic agents. Then, a picture
of the emerging problem of resistance is presented as it applies
to current-day circumstances into which chemosensitization may
play a role for fungal control. The subject of chemosensitization,
itself, is presented in-depth in the Section “Chemosensitization
of Antifungal Agents.” Therein, research on various facets of
chemosensitization, including the chemical nature of the agents,
their interaction with various commercial products, and their
mode of action or how they sensitize a fungal pathogen, if known,
is comprehensively covered. As fungal diseases confront both agri-
culture and medicine, this review will address fungal control and
use of chemosensitizing agents against fungal pathogens in both
ﬁelds. However, most of the research on chemosensitization has
involved antifungal agents against human mycoses; which will,
thus, be featured.

FUNGAL DISEASES
AGRICULTURAL FUNGAL DISEASES
For centuries, successful treatment of fungal diseases of crops, ani-
mals, and humans was relatively intermittent. Fungal diseases of
crops have had historic impacts on human civilization. Notable
examples include the relatively recent Great Potato Famine of Ire-
land and Great Bengal Famine (rice) during the mid nineteenth
and twentieth centuries, respectively. These famines each resulted
in millions of human deaths. Moreover, 70% of all major crop dis-
eases, to this day, are due to fungi. The long list of phytopathogenic
fungi and related crop diseases, numbering in the 100s, is beyond
the scope of this review. Overviews on crop fungal pathogens and
fungicides employed are available (Levetin and McMahon, 2003;
Russell, 2005; Strange and Scott, 2005). However, special mention
should be given to the current crop fungal disease threatening the
World. This is the fungal strain Ug99 (TTSK) of Puccinia graminis
tritici, the fungus that causes wheat stem rust. Ug99 has the poten-
tial of infecting 90% of the World’s wheat varieties. It has already
had devastating effect on the wheat crop of East Africa and has
spread to Asia and the Middle East (Singh et al., 2011).

FUNGAL DISEASES OF MEDICAL IMPORTANCE
The impact of human mycoses has not had the same level of his-
torical infamy as those affecting crops, until recently. Fatal cases
of thrush, later identiﬁed as being caused by the yeast Candida
albicans from the patient’s own microﬂora, had been known for

centuries (Martin and Jones, 1940). However, it has only been
within the last two decades that a sense of urgency developed
in combating human mycoses. This urgency stems from a vast
increase in incidence of opportunistic invasive fungal infections
(IFIs). Major IFIs include disseminated candidiasis, cryptococcal
meningitis, and invasive aspergillosis. The increase in incidence of
these diseases had its inception in the early 1990s as a result of
prodigious growth in the number of immunocompromised indi-
viduals, mainly arising from the AIDS epidemic, in addition to
an increase in immunosuppressive treatments required for organ
transplants, and an overall general debilitation (e.g., cancer malig-
nancies) associated with an aging population (Low and Rotstein,
2011). The increased incidence of IFIs has required massive levels
of antimicrobial chemotherapy accompanied by the overarching
problem in the progressive emergence of resistance to available
antimycotic agents (Loefﬂer and Stevens, 2003). This resistance
has set off a vicious cycle of intensive antimicrobial chemother-
apy, emergence of more resistant strains; which, in turn, promotes
emergence of more therapeutically intractable IFIs (Tseng and
Perfect, 2011; refs. therein). Compounding this problem is the
sluggish pace at which new antimycotics are being discovered that
have therapeutic practicality (Messer et al., 2009).

FUNGICIDES AND ANTIMYCOTICS
Following is a brief overview on the history in development of
antifungal agents for use in agriculture and medicine. Included is
an introduction to antifungal agents used and oversight commit-
tees that monitor emergence of resistant strains and which also
provide advice on their control or treatment.

AGRICULTURAL FUNGICIDES
Development and use of commercial antifungal agents in agri-
culture predated that for human medicine. One of the main
concerns in development of plant fungicides was phytotoxicity,
characteristic to many early fungicides. The earliest fungicides
used saltwater or lime to control wheat bunt in the seventeenth
century. About a century later copper sulfate, then known as the
Bordeaux mixture, was used to control powdery mildew of grapes.
Most early fungicides were based on inorganic minerals, includ-
ing arsenic and mercury. These had to be applied frequently and
in large amounts to be effective, presenting obvious hazards to
both human health and to the environment. In the early 1940s,
new classes of fungicides, the dithiocarbamates and phthalides,
were vast improvements over their prior inorganic counterparts.
These newer fungicides had higher fungicidal activity, were eas-
ily formulated for application, and were less phytotoxic (Horsfall,
1975).

The modern panoply of agricultural fungicides began to be
developed in the 1970s. The main ones included the ergosterol
biosynthetic inhibitors benzimidazoles, morpholines, piperazines,
imidazoles, pyrimidines, and triazoles; the mitochondrial res-
piration inhibitors, the anilides and strobilurins (Krämer and
Schirmer, 2008; refs. therein) and osmoregulation disruptors, the
phenylpyrroles (Kanetis et al., 2008).

In contrast to human patients, crops have an advantage in that
they can be genetically modiﬁed for resistance against fungal dis-
eases (Cornelissen and Melchers, 1993). But, as with fungicides,

Antifungal chemosensitization

fungal pathogens eventually can produce resistant strains, as
poignantly demonstrated, recently, with the Ug99 pandemic of
wheat (Singh et al., 2008).

ANTIMYCOTIC CHEMOTHERAPY
Development of antimycotics against human mycoses lagged
behind that for agricultural fungicides and even to that of antibi-
otics targeting bacteria. This delay was borne by the fact that, unlike
bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes and have a closer evolutionary afﬁl-
iation to humans. As such, they possess biochemical, genetic, and
cellular biological traits more common to humans than do bacte-
ria. Hence, ﬁnding suitable targets for fungal control that did not
present a risk to the human host has been a more complicated
endeavor than that for antibacterial agents.

It was not until the 1950s that the ﬁrst fungus-speciﬁc antimi-
crobials were discovered, some two decades after the discovery
of penicillin. These ﬁrst antimycotics included griseofulvin and
nystatin (Odds, 2003a). Griseofulvin, a polyketide isolated from
Penicillium griseofulvum, has limited application and is mainly
used against dermatophytosis. Its mode of action is by disrupting
mitotic spindle microtubules in fungi, preventing cellular division
(Panda et al., 2005).

The vast majority of antimycotic drugs discovered since grise-
ofulvin disrupt fungal cell membrane integrity, in one way or
another. The ﬁrst of these to be discovered was nystatin, a poly-
ene antimycotic isolated from a Streptomyces bacterium. Nystatin
forms hydrogen bonds with ergosterol, a fungus-speciﬁc sterol,
creating pores in the plasma membrane with concomitant cellular
leakage (Cass et al., 1970). Nystatin has a broader range of anti-
fungal activity than griseofulvin, but because of its nephrotoxicity
it is limited to topical or oral administration, for treatment of
dermatophytic and oropharyngeal infections.

Within a few years another antimycotic polyene was isolated
from Streptomyces nodosus, amphotericin B (AMB), having much
greater antifungal activity than nystatin, which is a mainstay of
antifungal chemotherapy to this day. Like nystatin, AMB binds
to ergosterol (Dutcher, 1968). However, it can, to a much lesser
degree, bind to other sterols, such as cholesterol, a component
of mammalian cell membranes, and its use has been associated
with signiﬁcant side effects, including kidney failure and death.
New formulations of AMB as a lipid or a cholesteryl sulfate
complex or in liposomal form (L-AMB) have been successful in
reducing these side effects and improving patient tolerance to
this drug (Thompson et al., 2009). AMB was the primary drug
used against IFIs until the advent of the triazoles (Walsh et al.,
2008).

The azoles were the next class of clinically acceptable antifungal
agents, ﬁrst appearing in 1969. The primary mode of action of all
azoles is prevention of ergosterol biosynthesis. Azoles inhibit a fun-
gal enzyme, 14α-sterol demethylase (cytochrome P450DM), that is
required for demethylation of lanosterol to ergosterol (Maertens,
2004). The imidazoles (e. g., miconazole, bifonazole, clotrimazole,
ketoconazole, etc.), were the ﬁrst azoles to be used, mainly in topi-
cal ointments. Oral or systemic use of imidazoles was unacceptable
in view of hepatotoxicity and erratic effectiveness. Although keto-
conazole was eventually approved for systemic use in 1981, it is
not effective against deep-seated mycoses.

Shortcomings of imidazole agents for systemic mycoses led
to discovery of a second group of azoles, the triazoles. How-
ever, triazoles have a greater afﬁnity for 14α-sterol demethylase
enzyme than do the imidazoles. An additional contributing factor
to the antifungal effect of the triazoles is aggravation of oxida-
tive stress in the fungus through greater accumulation of methyl
sterols. Accumulation of these sterols sensitizes fungal cells to the
oxidative burst from phagocytic cells (Shimokawa and Nakayama,
1992).

However, toxicity of triazoles to the patient can result from
cross-reactivity with several human cytochrome P450-dependent
enzymes (Thompson et al., 2009). There is a long list of other
drugs posing a risk of exacerbating negative interactions, if co-
administered with triazoles. The current clinically approved tri-
azoles include itraconazole, the ﬁrst of this class approved for
clinical use, followed by ﬂuconazole (FLU), perhaps the most
widely used, and three “second generation” triazoles, voriconazole,
posaconazole, and ravuconazole (Odds, 2003a).

The most recent class of commercially available systemic anti-
fungal agents is the echinocandins. This class of antimycotics
inhibits synthesis of β-1,3-glucan, an essential constituent of the
fungal cell wall and not found in humans. Lack of this polysaccha-
ride undermines cell wall integrity rendering the cell vulnerable to
osmotic stress and cell lysis. The ﬁrst echinocandin approved for
clinical use was caspofungin, discovered in 2000 (Onishi et al.,
2000). Additional echinocandins approved for therapeutic use
include micafungin and anidulafungin. This class of antimycotics
has reportedly fewer side effects than the polyenes and azoles, and
are considered to be well tolerated by patients. While showing efﬁ-
cacy against Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., the echinocandins
have low efﬁcacy against cryptococci (Eschenauer et al., 2007).

RESISTANCE
Development of resistance to currently available, commercial anti-
fungal agents is, perhaps, the major problem confronting their use
in both agriculture and medicine. A second common issue is the
inherent toxicity that antifungal agents present to human health,
and other non-target organisms in the environment. Of particular
concern is the possibility that fungicides applied in the environ-
ment for control of agricultural fungal pathogens may contribute
to development of cross-resistance by human infectious fungi.
This may especially be the case with triazoles, a class of antifungal
agents used both in agriculture and in medicine (Snelders et al.,
2009).

Despite success in discovery of new therapeutic antimycotics,
development of resistance remains the main clinical problem in
treatment of IFIs. Resistant strains of yeast and ﬁlamentous IFI
agents have been found for all major classes of antimycotics,
including the most recent echinocandins, with their novel mode
of action. As a result, clinical failures in antimycotic chemotherapy
are an increasingly vexing and worrisome problem.

Chemosensitization has the potential to fundamentally aug-
ment efﬁcacy of antifungal agents. But, perhaps its greatest
promise is in subverting resistance. In order to understand this
capability, a brief overview is provided on the mechanisms of resis-
tance and how signiﬁcant of a concern resistance has become for
the control of both agricultural and medical pathogenic fungi.

RESISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL FUNGICIDES
Currently, there are over 150 different agricultural fungicides
in use, worldwide (Phillips McDougall, 2006). Development of
widespread fungicide resistance in crop pathogens has been a con-
tinuous, fundamental problem, especially over the past 35 years.
Recognition of this problem reached such signiﬁcance that an
international consortium of fungicide manufacturers, academic,
and government scientists and crop advisors, was organized in
1994 as the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC). Pub-
lication of an overview of fungicide resistance in crop systems,
worldwide, shortly followed (Brent, 1995). FRAC has since pub-
lished a number of monographs, the latest update published in
2007 (Brent and Hollomon, 2007). Fungicide resistance manage-
ment has become a mainstay in pre- and post-harvest agriculture
(Förster et al., 2007).

Today, resistant strains of crop fungal pathogens can be found
for just about all classes of agricultural fungicides. The type of
resistance and the degree to which it has spread greatly depends
on several factors including mode of action, exclusivity of usage,
geographic expanse of application, single gene-target, reproduc-
tive rate of the pathogen, and cross-resistance within the class of
fungicide. The potential interaction of these factors in promoting
resistance requires a vigilance and communication; which is gen-
erally coalesced into an “action” compendium by FRAC. FRAC
has classiﬁed the major fungicides into various risk categories
with the benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, phenylamides and the
strobilurins, a fairly new class of fungicides, relegated to the “high-
risk”category (Morton and Staub, 2008). Cross-resistance between
fungicides may now extend into development of resistance in fungi
of medical importance from exposure to agricultural triazoles
(Deising et al., 2008; Snelders et al., 2009).

A prevalent mechanism by which fungi develop resistance is
called altered target site or qualitative resistance. This can be a sin-
gle point mutation in one amino acid in a fungal target protein.
Generally, this type of resistance renders the fungus fundamen-
tally resistant, reﬂected by ineffectiveness no matter the rate of
application of the fungicide. Qualitative resistance has played a
signiﬁcant role in limiting efﬁcacy of fungicides targeting various
components of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, known as
quinone outside inhibitors (QOIs), such as the strobilurins. Resis-
tance to QoIs may have developed rapidly because their target
proteins are encoded on mitochondrial DNA, and, thus, may not
have the DNA repair capability equal to that found in nuclear DNA
(Gisi et al., 2002). Other types of resistance include increased efﬂux
transporter activity, altered membrane structure reducing fungi-
cide absorption, fungicide degradation or over-expression of the
target gene (Del Sorbo et al., 2000). These latter mechanisms can
be possibly overcome by increased fungicide application rates, and
are referred to as quantitative resistance (Deising et al., 2008).

echinocandin drugs available, development of resistant strains to
at least any one of these drugs has resulted in clinical failures
in cryptococcosis, candidiasis or aspergillosis (Tseng and Perfect,
2011). Resistance to these drugs may reﬂect the dearth of tar-
gets, such as ergosterol-binding or inhibition of singular enzymes
involved in ergosterol or β-1,3-glucan biosynthesis, respectively.
With the current set of clinical antimycotics the overall target
involves membrane/cell wall integrity. Another class, represented
by ﬂucytosine, disrupts transcription/translation processes in fun-
gal cells by interrupting uracil production (Vermes et al., 2000).
However, because of the propensity for rapid development of
resistance against ﬂucytosine, when used alone, it is often com-
bined with other antimycotics, such as AMB against cryptococcal
meningitis (Hope et al., 2004; Papon et al., 2007).

The mechanisms of resistance of human and crop fungal
pathogens are similar. Antifungal drug resistance is divided into
two categories,“microbiological” and “clinical” (Kanafani and Per-
fect, 2008). Microbiological resistance is when a strain is not
susceptible to a dosage above an established breakpoint level,
based on standardized laboratory protocols, e.g., CLSI (2008a)
and is divided into categories, “primary” and “secondary.” These
categories are analogous to “quantitative” and “qualitative” used
to describe resistance in crop fungal pathogens. In primary resis-
tance, the pathogen is innately resistant without any prior exposure
to the drug. An example is resistance of Cryptococcus neoformans
to echinocandins. In contrast, secondary resistance develops after
repeated exposure to a drug, creating selection-pressure for genetic
changes in the pathogen, such as up-regulation of efﬂux pumps
(Niimi et al., 2004; Cannon et al., 2009), site mutations in target
genes, gene duplication, etc. Secondary resistance can be found
extensively among clinical strains and species of Candida. Exam-
ples include FLU resistance owing to enhanced expression of genes
coding efﬂux pumps (CDR1 and CDR2), or lanosterol demethy-
lation to ergosterol (ERG11; Shen et al., 2010) or resistance to
echinocandins by mutation in the β-1,3-glucan biosynthetic gene
FKS1 (Ben-Ami et al., 2011). In some cases, mechanisms of drug
resistance can involve multiple genes, as in certain strains of A.
fumigatus showing pan-resistance to azoles (Camps et al., 2012).
Clinical resistance basically entails cases where in vitro assays
fail to match in vivo results. This occurs when there is a discrep-
ancy between laboratory determinations predicting drug efﬁcacy,
based on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) accord-
ing to standardized protocols (e.g., CLSI, 2008a) and failure of
drug treatment under clinical conditions. The factors involved in
clinical resistance are responsible for the majority of drug fail-
ures in IFI therapy (Anderson, 2005; Kanafani and Perfect, 2008).
These factors may entail misdiagnosis, drug pharmacokinetics,
host/pathogen interactions, the infection site, fungal burden,
interactions with other infecting agents, immunocompetence, etc.

RESISTANCE TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC ANTIMYCOTICS
The rapid development of resistance to clinical antimycotics is
a worrisome predicament for effective treatment of IFIs (Nucci
and Perfect, 2008). There have already been over a half million
deaths from cryptococcosis in sub-Saharan Africa, alone, with an
estimated >600,000 deaths per year from cryptococcal menin-
gitis, worldwide (Park et al., 2009). Of the polyene, triazole, or

REMEDIATION STRATEGIES: MANAGING RESISTANCE TO ANTIFUNGAL
AGENTS
There are similarities in strategies in agricultural and medicine
to circumvent emerging resistance to antifungal agents. However,
there are also some vast differences, mainly a result of constraints
placed on the latitude in risking human health; although environ-
mental risks associated with fungicidal usage are a concern. In fact,

Antifungal chemosensitization

the original inorganic agricultural fungicides (copper and sulfur
based) are still used. However, overcoming antifungal resistance
by chemosensitizing agents could beneﬁt both agriculture and
medicine, discussed further in the Section “Chemosensitization
of Antifungal Agents.”

Managing resistance to agricultural fungicides
Management strategies and guidelines employed for resistance
to agricultural fungicides are evaluated regularly and published
in monograph form under the aegis of FRAC (Brent and Hol-
lomon, 2007). Successful management of resistance in crop fun-
gal pathogens generally necessitates large-scale cooperation over
broad areas; which requires agreement and commitment by both
fungicide manufacturers and farmers. Strategies include the fol-
lowing: (1) Combine application of and diversify fungicides (this is
analogous to combination therapy in clinical practice, see below),
or rotate use, so that more than one target in the fungus is
being affected; (2) Restrict application to critical periods to reduce
selection-pressure for developing resistance; (3) Do not exceed rec-
ommended rates; (4) If the resistant fungal pathogen is already well
established, avoid applying to eradicate, but use prophylactic levels
to keep populations low; (5) Withdraw ineffective fungicides from
the market; and (6) Develop new fungicides. It is this latter factor
that agriculture has an advantage over that of medicine in amelio-
rating fungicide resistance. The multitude of available fungicide
classes, and actual number of agricultural/horticultural fungi-
cides, eclipse the number of drugs available for human antimycotic
chemotherapy. Thus, there is a greater probability for maintain-
ing and improving the efﬁcacy of fungicides used for agriculture,
through altering chemical structure, without the limitations of
causing serious side effects, as in the medical arena. Moreover, in
agriculture, the fungal pathogen only need be “controlled” dur-
ing crop growth or storage, and not completely “eradicated,” as is
generally required in cases of human mycoses.

Managing resistance to antimycotic drugs
Managing antimycotic resistance involves a number of factors.
These include improving hospital sanitation (Benet et al., 2007),
surveillance for resistance, changing antimycotic, combination
therapy and development of new antimycotic drugs or therapeutic
strategies (e.g., chemosensitization).

Vigilance with regard to emerging resistance in both ﬁlamen-
tous fungi and Yeast is, today, performed by either of two stan-
dardized laboratory protocols for determining respective MICs,
as proposed by CLSI (2008a,b) and the European Committee
on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, 2008a,b). A
recent side-by-side comparison of each committee’s respective
assay methods for MICs of selected triazoles for strains and species
of Candida (>1000 clinical isolates) and for Aspergillus (245 clini-
cal isolates) found >97% (Pfaller et al., 2011c) and >98% (Pfaller
et al., 2011a) concordance between the two protocols, respectively.
Surveys of global clinical collections to detect potentially resis-
tant strains and species can provide insights on how to approach
antimycotic chemotherapy in a given global region. This approach
is currently performed by the ARTEMIS Antifungal Surveillance
Program (see Pfaller et al., 2005). Such global surveys provide use-
ful information with regard to potential efﬁcacy of antimycotic

drugs. A recent example is where MICs were determined for the
azoles, FLU, voriconazole and posaconazole for almost 1000 strains
from a global collection of C. neoformans (Pfaller et al., 2011b).
This survey provided a means of detecting emerging resistance
in several global regions. Establishment of clinical susceptibil-
ity breakpoints provides reasonable predictors of failure of any
particular antimycotic. In this study, no clinical breakpoints had
been established for any of these drugs against C. neoformans,
yet the survey provided epidemiologic cut-off values for each of
the drugs based on strains having MICs departing greatly from
overall modal MICs of wild-type strains. For example, the overall
modal MIC of FLU against C. neoformans, in worldwide surveys,
−1 of strains in South-
is 4 μg mL
east Asia and Africa (Chandenier et al., 2004; Bicanic et al., 2007)
reﬂected clinical failures using FLU.

−1. Whereas, MICs >64 μg mL

Combination therapy involves use of two or more antimycotics,
concurrently or sequentially (Baddley and Pappas, 2005). Such an
approach may be effective in two ways. One is through synergis-
tic interaction, where antifungal efﬁcacy is increased when drugs
are combined. The other is impeding development of resistance
because multiple genetic targets in the fungus are being over-
whelmed. However, the practicality of combination therapy has
had mixed results. Laboratory assays (in vitro) have shown pos-
itive or synergistic interactions between combinations of many
commercial antimycotics (Cuenca-Estrella, 2004; Chaturvedi et al.,
2011). Combinations of all three representatives of the “modern”
classes of systemic antimycotics,AMB, voriconazole and caspofun-
gin, showed highly synergistic antifungal activity, in vitro, against
aspergillosis agents, A. fumigatus, A. terreus and A. ﬂavus. How-
ever, the interaction became antagonistic at higher concentrations
of AMB or voriconazole (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2006). Another
example is where combinations of azole and one or two of the
caspofungin antimycotics are synergistic, in vitro, against clinical
strains of Candida and Cryptococcus (Roling et al., 2002). However,
when administered clinically (in vivo), the beneﬁts of combination
therapy may not always be realized as there may not be greater
antimycotic efﬁcacy and there may be a worsening of negative side
effects (Steinbach et al., 2011).

New antifungal agents, beyond the more recently available
azoles and echinocandins, are desperately needed as there is emerg-
ing resistance and some strains showing innate refractoriness to
all of them. Optimally, such new agents should target different
systems within the fungus than those being targeted currently.
Such new targets could include the calcineurin pathway, β-1,6-
glucan biosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, bioﬁlm formation
or genes speciﬁcally controlling fungal physiological events, such
as spore formation, ﬁlamentation, etc. (Espinel-Ingroff, 2009).

However, it is within the concept of “combination therapy”
or “new antifungal agents” that chemosensitization may have its
greatest utility. The remainder of this review is devoted to the
research on safe, chemosensitizing agents that could improve
antifungal chemotherapy (medicine) or phytopathogenic fungal
control (agriculture).

CHEMOSENSITIZATION OF ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS
A growing number of papers have begun to appear over the past
decade showing that certain natural products, relatively non-toxic

to humans, increase antifungal activity when co-administered
with a commercial antifungal agent. Many of these products
(“chemosensitizers”) are known constituents of commonly used
herbs and spices. Because these herbs and spices have been part of
the human culinary regimen for centuries, there is a presumption
that the constituents of these plants are probably relatively safe.
Moreover, various synthetic products have been identiﬁed hav-
ing a synergistic interaction with commercial antimycotics, while
not possessing signiﬁcant antifungal activity alone. The mode of
action of these natural and synthetic chemosensitizers to increase
antimycotic activity is not always understood. However, research
is beginning to show that many of these compounds interfere with
the ability of fungi to respond to stress. Such stress may be from an
environmental source (e.g., uv, heat, drought, etc.) or from a com-
mercial antifungal agent. Other modes of action of chemosensi-
tizers include disruption of fungal membrane integrity, inhibition
of efﬂux pumps, or induction of oxidative stress. A comprehen-
sive listing of research papers on chemosensitization of antifungal
agents, types of compounds tested and modes of action, if known,
is available in Table 1.

Interactions between antifungal compounds are usually ﬁrst
determined, in vitro, by microdilution checkerboard assays either
using CLSI (2008a,b) or EUCAST (2008a,b) protocols. Syner-
gistic, additive or antagonistic interactions are deﬁned by com-
paring the lowest concentration of agent needed to inhibit fun-
gal growth, MICs, after test agents are combined, to MICs of
the agents, alone. These interactions are recorded as Fractional
Inhibitory Concentration Indices (FICI), where: FICI= MIC of
compound A in combination with compound B/MIC of com-
pound A, alone)+ (MIC of compound B in combination with
compound A/MIC of compound B, alone). Compound inter-
actions are deﬁned as follows: synergistic (FICI≤ 0.5), additive
(0.5 < FICI≤ 1), neutral (1 < FICI≤ 2) or antagonistic (FICI > 2;
Isenberg, 1992), or the more guarded interpretation of FICI val-
ues of ≤0.5 as synergy, and >0.5–4 as indifference (Odds, 2003b).
Interactions can also be calculated according to fungicidal activity
as Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) as the lowest con-
centration of agent where ≥99.9% fungal death is achieved and
fractional fungicidal interaction indices (FFCIs) are calculated as
for FICIs.

CHEMOSENSITIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL FUNGICIDES
Compared to the amount of research on chemosensitization of
antifungal drugs, there has been relatively little research on their
use with agricultural fungicides. This is quite in contrast to that
of the research on discovery of natural fungicides, of which there
are many. However, the source of almost all of the widely used
commercial fungicides for agriculture is mainly bacterial, partic-
ularly species of Streptomyces (Copping and Duke, 2007). Such
fungicides include the polyoxins, kasugamycin, and more. The
strobilurins, already discussed, are natural products from the fun-
gus, Strobilurus tenacellus. While these compounds have potent
antifungal activity they also possess high mammalian toxicity.

Plant natural products have also been used for controlling
plant fungal pathogens. However, these compounds, in general,
do not exhibit antifungal activities sufﬁcient for wide commercial
acceptance. Moreover, many of these plant-derived compounds

are phytotoxic and, thus, are of limited utility in crop systems
other than, perhaps, as promising candidates as chemosensitiz-
ers for antimycotic drugs (see below). Few have been assessed as
chemosensitizing agents to agricultural fungicides.

Cinnamaldehyde is perhaps the most widely known of plant
natural products used as a fungicide against plant, or plant-
product fungal pathogens (Copping and Duke, 2007). Its mode of
action was proposed to be similar to that of the echinocandins, in
that it inhibited β-1,3-glucan synthase (Bang et al., 2000). Alone,
cinnamaldehyde has only nominal antifungal activity. However,
cinnamaldehyde in combination with other plant natural prod-
ucts, the phenolics eugenol, quercetin, and catechin, resulted, in
some cases, in a >100-fold synergistic antifungal activity against
wood-decaying fungi (Yen and Chang, 2008). It was concluded that
the combination of fungal cell wall degradation, and the associated
osmotic stress (cinnamaldehyde), with the addition of an oxidative
stress agent (the phenolics) resulted in synergistic antifungal activ-
ity. Combination of cinnamaldehyde and another plant phenolic,
octylgallate, also showed a promising level of antifungal activity
against wood-decaying fungi (Hsu et al., 2007); the mode of action
of octylgallate proposed to result from cell membrane surfactant
properties (Kubo et al., 2001).

With regard to actual synergism of commercial fungicides,
octylgallate was found to synergize antifungal activity of ﬂu-
dioxonil and a strobilurin, kresoxim-methyl, against the apple
pathogen Penicillium expansum, in vitro. However, based on hyper-
sensitivity of singular gene deletion mutants of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, as a model fungus, it was concluded that octylgallate dis-
rupted the oxidative stress response system, debilitating the fungus
further to the oxidative stress introduced by the fungicides (Kim
et al., 2010b). In addition, the combination of octylgallate and
ﬂudioxonil rendered P. expansum ﬂudioxonil-resistant strains to
become susceptible.

Further

research on chemosensitization of crop fungal
pathogens to commercial fungicides has mainly involved A. ﬂavus.
A. ﬂavus is not a plant pathogen, per se, but an opportunistic
fungus, generally infecting a variety of crops or crop-products
under some form of environmental stress (e.g., drought, heat,
insect damage). The main concern of infections of crops by A.
ﬂavus is contamination by aﬂatoxin, a highly carcinogenic myco-
toxin (Yu et al., 2007). In an effort to develop methods for
controlling A. ﬂavus, focus was placed on various natural prod-
ucts as chemosensitizing agents to commercial fungicides. One
of the ﬁrst efforts found that the phenolic, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid, disrupted glutathione homeostasis, signiﬁcantly enhancing,
by almost 100-fold, the antifungal activity of ﬂudioxonil (Kim
et al., 2007b). Additional natural compounds were also found to
enhance activity of commercial fungicides. These included the
alkaloid, berberine, and several phenolic compounds, enhancing
antifungal activity of ﬂudioxonil and strobilurin against A. ﬂavus
by further disrupting its oxidative stress response system (Kim
et al., 2007a). Also tested were 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, salicy-
laldehyde and other benzo analogs. These compounds enhanced
activity of strobilurins and antimycin A against A. ﬂavus and P.
expansum by disrupting the HOG1 signaling pathway, which con-
trols osmotic and oxidative stress responses in fungi (Kim et al.,
2008b, 2011).

Antifungal chemosensitization

Interestingly, gallic and caffeic acids are potent inhibitors of
aﬂatoxin biosynthesis (Mahoney and Molyneux, 2004; Kim et al.,
2008c). Based on microarray analysis it was found that only a few
genes of A. ﬂavus were upregulated when treated with caffeic acid;
the most prominent ones being peroxiredoxin genes. These genes
encode enzymes that reduce endogenous peroxides, but also act
in the signaling pathway of the oxidative stress response. Further
studies on phenotypic responses of gene deletion mutants showed
that antioxidants, such as gallic or caffeic acid, speciﬁcally target
the antioxidative stress response system of A. ﬂavus, shutting down
the aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway (Kim et al., 2005, 2008c). Col-
lectively, these results indicate that the chemosensitizing mode of
action of redox-active phenolic compounds is associated with the
fungal antioxidation system.

All of the aforementioned studies were conducted in vitro.
Many compounds have been found to show some promise as
chemosensitizers to commercial fungicides. However, so far, no
ﬁeld studies on use of these chemosensitizers co-applied with a
commercial fungicide have been reported.

CHEMOSENSITIZATION OF ANTIMYCOTIC DRUGS
Use of natural fungicidal agents to treat human mycoses, especially
dermatophytosis, is an ancient practice, notably in Chinese herbal
medicine (Han et al., 2007). Natural products as chemosensitizers
were ﬁrst used as a means of “pharmacologic circumvention of
multidrug resistance” using Vinca alkaloids as inhibitors of drug
efﬂux pumps overexpressed in malignant cells resistant to anti-
cancer drugs (Ford and Hait, 1993). It is, perhaps, for these two
reasons there has been far more research on chemosensitization
of antifungal drugs in human medicine, than with fungicides in
agriculture. The higher level of chemosensitization research on
antimycotic drugs may also result from the much more limited
number of antifungal agents available, than that for agriculture.
These factors, plus the additional problem of emerging resistance
to antifungal drugs, have all spurred on an effort to investigate new
approaches in antimycotic chemotherapy, especially with regard to
phytopharmaceuticals (Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009).

Plant and marine natural products
For centuries, crude infusions of leaves and ﬂowers have been used
in folk medicine to treat superﬁcial cutaneous fungal infections,
especially historic with regard to Chinese and Ayurvedic medicinal
herbs. These infusions contain natural products of plant essential
oils (Kalemba and Kunicka, 2003) and many of those found in
spices, in particular, have been found to be antimycotic (Beuchat,
1994; Arora and Kaur, 1999). Moreover, plant natural products
that show antimicrobial activity have some potential as therapeu-
tic agents in combination or can serve as precursors for structural
modiﬁcation to augment activity (Wink, 2008).

Plant extracts and essential oils.
In general, it has long been
shown that the essential oils of “spices” have antifungal activ-
ity against cutaneous and systematic mycotic agents. One recent
example shows that antifungal activity of the essential oil of
Lavandula viridis, a member of the mint family, is due to its
monoterpenes. The composite extract of this oil showed antifungal
activity against various dermatophytes, C. albicans and C. neofor-
mans by disrupting cell membrane integrity (Zuzarte et al., 2011).

Moreover, many of the individual compounds of these extracts,
such as thymol, eugenol, and their O-methyl derivatives, possess
nominal antifungal activity (Fontenelle et al., 2011). The steam
distillate of Thymus pulegioides, also a member of the mint family,
containing mainly carvacrol and thymol, had considerable anti-
fungal activity against a variety of strains of dermatophytic fungi,
Candida and Aspergillus. As with the steam distillate of L. viridis,
this oil created lesions in the fungal cell membrane and reduced
ergosterol content (Pinto et al., 2006). It has been proposed that
antifungal activity of carvacrol followed a similar pattern as that for
thymol, creation of cellular membrane lesions (Pinto et al., 2009).
However, other modes of action have been proposed. Antifungal
activity of carvacrol, thymol and eugenol were shown to be directly
correlated to amplitude of Ca2+
bursts coupled with up-regulation
of stress response pathways and drug efﬂux. Carvacrol triggers
ionic disruption and cellular stress related to an inability to reg-
ulate vacuolar acidiﬁcation. Such activity of carvacrol, and other
phenolic compounds found in essential oils, may synergistically
interact with azole drugs, also known to inhibit H
-efﬂux, affect-
ing vacuolar acidiﬁcation (Rao et al., 2010). The chemosensitizing
mode of action of these types of compounds with commercial
antimycotics is discussed further, below.

+

Combinations of plant essential oils and commercial antimy-
cotics have resulted in synergistic antifungal activity. Combina-
tion of two plant terpenoids, anethole, a natural phenylpropene
imparting ﬂavor to anise and fennel, and polygodial had syner-
gistic antifungal activity against C. albicans, at clinically practical
−1). But, combination of anethole and AMB
MICs (<0.1 μg mL
were antagonistic, lowering antifungal activity (Kubo and Hime-
jima, 1991). Anethole combined with both miconazole and AMB
resulted in synergistic activity against C. albicans (Lee and Kim,
1999). Estragole, another phenylpropene and the main constituent
of the essential oils of a Korean medicinal herb, Agastache rugosa,
combined with ketoconazole also resulted in synergistic antifungal
activity against Blastoschizomyces capitatus, a rare fungal pathogen
often resulting in fatal mycoses in immunocompromised individ-
uals (Shin and Kang, 2003). However, combination of estragole
with AMB was antagonistic, reducing antifungal activity against C.
albicans (Shin and Pyun, 2004). It was recently shown that anet-
hole is an inhibitor of fungal chitin synthase (Yutani et al., 2011a).
Hence, the antifungal synergism between the phenylpropenes and
the azoles is probably related to effectively reducing overall fungal
cell wall/membrane integrity. The mode of phenylpropene antag-
onism with AMB is unknown. Perhaps the phenylpropenes inhibit
binding of polyene drugs to ergosterol. However, the essential oil
of myrtle (Myrtus communis), consisting mainly of the monoter-
penes α-pinene and 1,8-cineole, has been shown to have synergistic
activity with AMB (FICI 0.26) against strains of C. albicans and A.
niger (Mahboubi and Ghazian Bidgoli, 2010). No mode of action
for this synergism was provided.

One of the earliest investigations of the effects of combining
plant essential oils and a clinical antimycotic involves a small
medicinal herb, Santolina chamaecyparissus, cultivated in Europe,
Asia and Africa. The essential oil from this plant was found to
have a synergistic antifungal effect against C. albicans when com-
bined with clotrimazole, in both in vitro and in vivo (murine)
assays (Suresh et al., 1997). The essential oil of S. chamaecyparissus

contains more than 80 constituents, practically all terpenoids,
many common to a broad spectrum of plants (Grosso et al., 2009).
Combination of the latex of Euphorbia characias, known to contain
a high concentration of terpenes, with ketoconazole also resulted
in synergistic antifungal activity against C. albicans in in vitro
assays (Giordani et al., 2001). The essential oil of Pelargonium
graveolens, used in the perfume industry, and its main components,
geraniol and citronellol, had additive and synergistic in vitro anti-
fungal activity against two species of Aspergillus, in combination
with AMB or ketoconazole (Shin, 2003). Another in vitro exam-
ination of the essential oil of P. graveolens in combination with
nystatin showed some synergistic activity against clinical strains
and species of Candida, but not to the extent of the synergistic
interaction of nystatin with the essential oil from Origanum vul-
gare (oregano; Rosato et al., 2009). Interestingly, this study did
not ﬁnd any synergism between nystatin and the essential oil of
Melaleuca alternifolia, a common herbal antibacterial or antifungal
preparation.

Of the herbs Satureja montana, L. angustifolia, L. hybrida,
Syzygium aromaticum, O. vulgare, Rosmarinus ofﬁcinalis and six
chemotypes of T. vulgaris, the essential oil from one of the chemo-
types of T. vulgaris lowered the MIC of AMB by 80% against C.
−1 (Giordani et al., 2004). However, at
albicans at 0.01–0.3 μg mL
−1, the interaction was
very low dosages of AMB <0.0025 μg mL
antagonistic. Combination of the essential oil from Cinnamomum
cassia (Chinese cinnamon), containing mainly cinnamaldehyde,
with AMB showed synergistic antifungal activity against C. albi-
cans, reducing the MIC of AMB by 80% (Giordani et al., 2006). Six
common terpenoids associated with essential oils of plants were
highly synergistic with FLU against C. albicans with the FICIs of
linalool (0.14), benzyl benzoate (0.156), and eugenol (0.265) indi-
cating greatest chemosensitizing capacity (Zore et al., 2011). Three
+
analogs of cinnamaldehyde were recently found to inhibit H
-
efﬂux of FLU-resistant strains of Candida. Wherein, FLU inhibited
H
-efﬂux in susceptible strains, it had little effect on this efﬂux
in the resistant strains (Shreaz et al., 2011b). Inhibition of plasma
+
membrane H
-ATPase activity, especially by the 3,5-dimethoxy-
4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde analog, occurred in conjunction with
damage to the plasma membrane. Another group of benzenoids,
analogs of anisaldehydes, showed almost identical results to those
identiﬁed with the cinnamaldehydes, including activity relation-
ships based on the position of methoxyl groups on the aromatic
ring (Shreaz et al., 2011a). The acidic analog of cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamic acid, was synergistic with itraconazole against C. neofor-
mans (Faria et al., 2011). The effects of these benzenoid natural
products on pathogenic yeasts, including FLU-resistant Candida,
indicate such compounds may have a promising role in drug
against candidiasis and cryptococcosis in conjunction with azole
antimycotics.

+

Simple terpenoids. Natural plant compounds from essential
oils that have been studied the most with regard to antimycotic
chemosensitizing are eugenol, the predominant natural phenolic
of clove oil, and thymol analogs. As observed for cinnamalde-
hyde (Shreaz et al., 2011b) and anisaldehyde (Shreaz et al., 2011a)
benzenoids, the anticandidal mode of action of eugenol and thy-
mol also involves inhibition of H
-ATPase driven efﬂux, leading

+

to intracellular acidiﬁcation (Ahmad et al., 2010b). Similar to
the cinnamaldehydes, both these compounds disrupt the ultra-
structure of the plasma membrane of Candida. Moreover, when
combined, a synergistic anticandidal activity occurs (Braga et al.,
2007). Of even more interest is the synergistic interaction between
eugenol or methyleugenol with FLU, against clinical strains of
−1) species of Candida.
FLU-resistant (MICs FLU > 64 μg mL
In vitro checkerboard assays of these compounds with Candida
strains having FLU MICs≥ 80 μg mL
−1 resulted in FICIs < 0.5
for almost all strains tested, with methyleugenol showing greater
chemosensitizing potency than eugenol (Ahmad et al., 2010a).

One of the ﬁrst papers studying the interaction between thymol
and antimycotic drugs involved mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) mutants sakAΔ and mpkC Δ of A. fumigatus involved
in osmotic/oxidative stress regulation. The sakAΔ was signiﬁ-
cantly more tolerant to certain experimental antifungal agents
(Congo red and calcoﬂuor white) than the wild-type and mpkC Δ
mutant. The antifungal compounds tested targeted fungal cell
membrane/cell wall integrity as determined by hypersensitivity of
slt2Δ and bck1Δ mutants of S. cerevisiae, having deleted genes
in the cell wall integrity MAP kinase pathway. Co-application
of thymol with ketoconazole, FLU or AMB resulted in complete
growth inhibition of the A. fumigatus wild-type strain at lower
doses compared to independent treatment of each compound
(Kim et al., 2008a). However, a later study that included additional
strains of A. ﬂavus and A. terreus showed mixed results. Combi-
nations of thymol with ketoconazole, FLU or AMB resulted in
enhanced antifungal activity, as above, with all strains except two
of A terreus, where the interaction was antagonistic (Kim et al.,
2010a). The cause of this antagonism has yet to be determined.
Thymol was also found to have synergistic interaction with FLU
against FLU-resistant clinical strains of C. albicans according to
FICIs in in vitro checkerboard assays (Guo et al., 2009). Another
study found thymol to have synergistic interactions with AMB,
FLU and itraconazole against C. albicans, but was only synergistic
with AMB, of the three drugs, against C. neoformans (Faria et al.,
2011). A microarray analysis for detecting global gene expression
of S. cerevisiae treated with thymol indicated increased expression
of genes involved in drug efﬂux and iron uptake and repres-
sion of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis (Bi et al., 2010).
The microarray results apparently did not present any signiﬁcant
indications that gene expression involving cell wall integrity was
affected, unlike that found for ﬁlamentous fungi.

The papers cited above showed that essential oils from plants
act as synergists of commercial antimycotics in vitro. The pre-
sumption might be that they are safe simply because of their
historic use as spices, cosmetics or herbal medicines. One recent
study, however, indicated that the essential oil of Ocimum sanc-
tum (sacred basil), composed mainly of the monoterpene linalool,
and the phenylpropene, methylchavicol, along with another 48
minor constituents, was non-toxic. This essential oil had a sig-
niﬁcant synergistic interaction (FICI < 0.5) with both FLU and
ketoconazole against experimental and clinical species and strains
of Candida (Amber et al., 2010). This synergism resulted in over-
coming resistance to FLU in some FLU-resistant strains. Moreover,
a hemolysis bioassay of human red blood cells revealed that FLU
and AMB had hemolytic activity far greater than that of the O.

sanctum essential oil. It is possible that the mode of chemosen-
sitizing activity of the essential oil of O. sanctum is due to its
major constituent, methylchavicol. As cited above, the antifun-
gal activity of another phenylpropene, anethole, was by inhibition
of fungal chitin synthase (Yutani et al., 2011a). The combination
of inhibitors of chitin and ergosterol biosynthesis by a phenyl-
propene (methylchavicol) and a triazole (FLU), respectively, may
undermine fungal cell wall/membrane integrity.

Sesqui- and triterpenoids. The natural sesquiterpene alcohol,
farnesol, has been shown to have synergistic interaction with FLU
against C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. What makes farnesol even
more intriguing is that it is actually a natural product of C. albi-
cans involved in quorum-sensing for regulation of ﬁlamentation
(Hornby et al., 2001; Oh et al., 2001). It was also determined that
farnesol disrupts bioﬁlm formation, a major infectivity compo-
nent of these pathogens (Ramage et al., 2002). Sub-antifungal
levels of azole antimycotic drugs cause an accumulation of far-
nesol, maintaining the pathogen in the yeast morph, and reducing
bioﬁlm formation and its infectivity (Hornby and Nickerson,
2004). In in vitro assays, addition of farnesol reversed resistance
in FLU-resistant strains (Jabra-Rizk et al., 2006). In synergy tests,
resistant strains (≥64 μg mL
−1 FLU) were rendered susceptible
−1) when both compounds were employed. Farnesol
(<8 μg mL
disrupted the plasma membrane integrity of these yeasts, render-
ing them more permeable to uptake of exogenous chemicals, such
as antimycotic drugs. However, it was determined that farnesol
triggers apoptosis (regulated cell-death) in C. albicans through a
variety of mechanisms including production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and hence oxidative stress, mitochondrial degrada-
tion and production of caspases, proteases associated with apop-
tosis (Shirtliff et al., 2009). A recent study, however, shows that
genes within the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway are downregu-
lated in farnesol treated C. albicans in association with increased
sensitivity to FLU, suggesting an alternate or additional mode of
action (Yu et al., 2012).

The pentacyclic triterpenoid, retigeric acid B, isolated from the
lichen, Lobaria kurokawae, was recently found to be a potential
antimycotic and/or chemosensitizing agent to azole antimycotics.
L. kurokawae has been a component of Chinese folk medicine, but
not directly in antifungal applications. Retigeric acid B showed a
−1 against clinical strains of C. albi-
range in MICs of 8–16 μg mL
cans (Sun et al., 2009a). This level of antifungal activity is fairly
high for a natural terpenoid/isoprene product in view that other
such compounds discussed in this review require much higher
−1. This same study also
anticandidal MICs of 100–300 μg mL
found that co-application of retigeric acid B with FLU, ketocona-
zole or itraconazole resulted in a signiﬁcant synergistic antifungal
interaction against azole-resistant strains of C. albicans. The anti-
fungal and synergistic modes of action of retigeric acid B include
inhibition of efﬂux pump activity and ergosterol biosynthesis;
which, in turn, undermines cell membrane integrity and cellu-
lar ion homeostasis (Sun et al., 2009b). The antifungal mode of
action of retigeric acid B was investigated further and found to
be associated with ROS related apoptosis (Chang et al., 2011).
It was proposed that this apoptosis stemmed from inhibition of
the sterol biosynthetic pathway with concomitant accumulation

of farnesol leading to ROS production and apoptosis similar to
that described by use of farnesol, alone (see above; Shirtliff et al.,
2009).

There has been additional research on natural triterpenoids as
chemosensitizing agents in antimycotic drug-resistant fungi. In
all of these cases, the triterpenoid mode of action is disruption
of efﬂux pump activity in strains of S. cerevisiae overexpressing
C. albicans efﬂux pump genes such as MDR1 (belonging to the
major facilitator superfamily) or CDR1 (belonging to the ATP-
binding cassette superfamily). One of these triterpenoids was 9α,
11α-epoxycholest-7-ene-3β,5,6,19-tetrol 6-acetate (ECTA), iso-
lated from the marine sponge, Dysidea arenaria (Jacob et al.,
2003). In a strain of S. cerevisiae containing and overexpress-
ing C. albicans MDR1, they found a 35-fold decrease in FLU
MICs (300–8.5 μM) when ECTA was co-applied. Another group
of triterpenoid inhibitors of efﬂux pump activity identiﬁed later by
this group was the capisterones (Li et al., 2006). These compounds
were isolated from the marine green alga, Penicillus capitatus. Like
ECTA, they did not show innate antifungal activity, alone, but
showed a synergistic interaction with FLU (FICI < 0.5) in both the
CDR1- and MDR1-overexpressing strains of S. cerevisiae. A third
group of sulfated triterpenoids from the marine sponge, Topsentia
sp., was isolated by this group. Using the same screening tools plus
additional clinical resistant strains of C. albicans overexpressing
MDR1, they showed these sulfated sterols had similar synergistic
characteristics as those triterpenoids previously tested (Digiro-
lamo et al., 2009). Lastly, a triterpenoid, schinol, isolated from
the plant, Schinus terebinthifolius, reacted synergistically with itra-
conazole, but not with AMB, against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis,
the causative agent of systemic paracoccidioidomycosis (Johann
et al., 2010).

Tea extracts, epigallocatechins, gallates, and polyphenols. One
of earliest studies to detect synergistic interaction between nat-
ural products and antimycotic drugs involved alkylgallates and
AMB. Of four natural antioxidants tested, at non-fungitoxic lev-
els, propylgallate was found to enhance and prolong toxicity of
AMB in vitro against a reference strain of C. albicans (ATCC
11651; Andrews et al., 1977). The mode of action of propy-
lgallate, and the other less active antioxidants, was proposed
as they stabilized the multiple double bonds of the polyene
moiety of the drug. In testing propylgallate and AMB against
more strains and species of Candida it was concluded that
the antioxidant-based prolongation of AMB stability and the
synergism by propylgallate were independent activities (Beggs
et al., 1978a,b). Other phenolic derivatives that possess antiox-
idant activity, L-DOPA (L-β-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and
dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine) were soon identiﬁed
to augment anticandidal efﬁcacy of AMB, as well (Andrews et al.,
1979). Because of the water solubility of these chemosensitizers,
and their inherent safety as natural biochemical products, the
authors felt they were natural candidates for in vivo or clinical
testing. But, no results of such testing have been published.

Following Beggs’ and Andrews’ work, more natural com-
pounds possessing intrinsic antioxidant activity were identiﬁed
as stabilizers of AMB, but the work has largely gone unnoticed
(Beggs, 1983). Propylgallate at non-fungicidal levels increased the

antifungal activity in in vitro tests against clinical strains of C.
albicans combined with imidazoles (Strippoli et al., 2000) and
with triazoles (D’Auria et al., 2001). In these cases, it was spec-
ulated that propylgallate increased cell membrane porosity by
interacting with membrane phospholipids and inhibited ABC-
transporter drug efﬂux, allowing greater drug inﬂux and retention.
It was also proposed that propylgallate increased inhibition of
P450-dependent lanosterol 14α-demethylase by azoles. Also, com-
binations of propylgallate and AMB, terbinaﬁne, butenaﬁne or
ketoconazole were either synergistic or additive, and in one case
antagonistic, depending on the drug and strain of ﬁlamentous
fungus, chieﬂy species of Fusarium that are ocular pathogens (Xu
et al., 2006).

Alkyl chain length of gallic acid esters can also affect antifun-
gal activity and chemosensitization capacity. Of methyl, propyl,
octyl, and decyl esters examined, in vitro, octyl was found to be
the most potent against strains of A. ﬂavus, A. fumigatus, and A.
terreus when combined with AMB, FLU, or ketoconazole. This
chemosensitizing capacity was determined to result from stressing
the antioxidant system of the fungi (Kim et al., 2010a). This pro-
vides further evidence that such phenolic compounds augment
antimycotic agents that cause oxidative stress in fungi. This would
especially be the case in co-application with AMB, which is now
known to induce oxidative stress in fungi, in addition to causing
plasma membrane leakage (Blum et al., 2008).

et al., 1991), Trichophyton refractory to FLU or ﬂucytosine (Park
et al., 2011), and different infective species of Candida (Park et al.,
2006). Activity of EGCG is highly pH dependent and under acidic
conditions has signiﬁcant synergistic activity with AMB or FLU,
against both FLU- susceptible and resistant strains of C. albi-
cans (Hirasawa and Takada, 2004). Murine model assays (BALB/c)
showed that mice with disseminated candidiasis given EGCG (at
−1 bw)
2 mg kg
survived 4 weeks longer than those given AMB therapy, alone
(Han, 2007a). Almost identical results occurred when extracts of
grape seed, also rich in polyphenols such as EGCG and proan-
thocyanidins, were administered with AMB in a parallel murine
assay (Han, 2007b). The probable mode of action of synergism
of EGCG to both AMB and FLU is that EGCG is an inhibitor of
dihydrofolate reductase in C. albicans and is thus an antifolate
(Navarro-Martinez et al., 2006). This disruption of the folic acid
cycle, in turn, inhibits the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway result-
ing in an additional stress to cell membrane/wall integrity after
exposure to either AMB or triazole antimycotics.

Curcumin, a symmetrical diphenolic compound rendering the
yellow pigment to turmeric, was noted to have greater antifun-
gal activity against P. brasiliensis than FLU, with nominal activity
against clinical strains of Candida, Aspergillus, and C. neoformans
(Martins et al., 2009). It was determined that curcumin induced
oxidative stress, leading to apoptosis. Curcumin treatment of C.
albicans resulted in elevated levels of ROS and concomitant up-
regulation in expression of several genes associated with fungal
oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and oxi-
doreductase (Sharma et al., 2010b). It was recently reported that

when curcumin was co-applied at non-fungicidal levels with any
of ﬁve azole drugs (FLU, miconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole,
or voriconazole) or two polyenes (nystatin and AMB) against 21
strains of C. albicans having some resistance to these drugs, all
interactions were synergistic (FICIs 0.09–0.5) with MIC dosages
of the antimycotics being reduced by 10- to 35-fold (Sharma et al.,
2010a).

Non-phenolic plant natural product chemosensitizers. There
has been a great deal of interest over the potential use of nat-
ural products from garlic (Allium sativum) as antimycotics, either
directly or as chemosensitizers (Davis, 2005). Extracts of garlic,
and the compounds within, were successfully used to treat cases
of cerebrospinal cryptococcosis via intravenous administration to
patients in the People’s Republic of China (Davis et al., 1990). The
raw extracts of garlic were also found to have antifungal activ-
ity against Scedosporium proliﬁcans, an invasive fungal pathogen
that is resistant to all available antimycotic drugs (Davis et al.,
2003). Synergistic interaction between diallyl trisulﬁde, from gar-
lic, combined with AMB, was found against C. neoformans (Shen
et al., 1996), another early example, in addition to propylgal-
late mentioned above, of a natural product as an antimycotic
chemosensitizer. A later study of the essential oil from A. sativum
combined with ketoconazole showed synergistic antifungal activ-
ity against three dermatophytic species of Trichophyton (Pyun and
Shin, 2006).

The mode of antifungal and chemosensitizing action of allicin,
an allyl-sulfur compound from garlic, has been determined. Com-
binations of allicin and AMB result in a highly synergistic anti-
fungal interaction against S. cerevisiae (Ogita et al., 2006) and
C. albicans (Borjihan et al., 2009). Allicin speciﬁcally enhances
AMB vacuolar disruption in fungi when ergosterol is present in
the membrane to which AMB can bind. If ergosterol is not present,
as in erg6 Δ mutants of S. cerevisiae, the fungus is resistant to
both AMB, with or without allicin present (Ogita et al., 2010).
In vitro assays of combinations of FLU and allicin of 24 FLU-
resistant strains of C. albicans showed 23 synergistic interactions.
In in vivo assays, using a BALB/c murine model of candidiasis,
cohorts receiving FLU and FLU+ allicin survived equivalently,
however, the infection load in kidney biopsies was signiﬁcantly
lower in the FLU+ allicin cohort (Guo et al., 2010). Examination
of global expression of genes of S. cerevisiae treated with allicin
revealed a multifaceted effect on genes involved in sulfur amino
acid metabolism, gene repair and the oxidative stress response
pathway (Yu et al., 2010).

Berberine is a benzodioxoloquinolizine alkaloid mainly found
in various plants in the families Berberidaceae, such as shrubs
native to southern Europe, or Ranunculaceae, such as goldthread,
Coptis chinensis, native to China. Berberine, extracted from roots
of goldthread, has a long history as an antifungal agent in Chinese
folk medicine (Creasy, 1979). However, berberine was speciﬁcally
reported to have anticandidal activity and its combination with
AMB is synergistic (Han and Lee, 2005). In one of the rare studies
of a natural chemosensitizer with a commercial antimycotic drug
in mouse bioassays, it was found that cohorts having disseminated
C. albicans candidiasis that received berberine+ AMB survived
more than twice as long as those receiving AMB, alone. Moreover,

to achieve the same duration of survival as the AMB+ berberine
cohort four-times the AMB dose, alone, was required. Com-
bination of berberine and FLU resulted in a synergistic inter-
action against FLU-resistant strains of C. albicans, with MICs
−1 and FICIs < 0.13
>64 μg mL
in combination with berberine (Quan et al., 2006).

−1 of FLU reduced to <2 μg mL

The mode of action of berberine appears to be induction of
oxidative stress, as demonstrated with two commercial agricul-
tural fungicides, strobilurin and ﬂudioxonil. Strobilurin targets
complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory pathway, while ﬂu-
dioxonil targets the MAPK system associated with osmoregula-
tion, in ﬁlamentous fungi. Activity of strobilurin was elevated
by co-application with berberine in A. fumigatus wild-type and
resistant MAPK mutants. The study showed that berberine dis-
rupted Mn-SOD (mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) required
for detoxiﬁcation of ROS produced from the inhibition of mito-
chondrial respiration by strobilurin. Furthermore, this additional
oxidative stress induced by berberine also resulted in overcoming
resistance to ﬂudioxonil (Kim et al., 2007a).

These ﬁndings were supported by a later study involving pro-
teomic analyses of C. albicans strains, resistant to FLU. When these
strains were treated with a combination of FLU and berberine, pro-
teomic proﬁles revealed they affected mitochondrial respiration,
resulting in a signiﬁcant production of ROS (Xu et al., 2009). This
activity was reversed by addition of either ascorbic acid or reduced
glutathione. An additional study also showed synergism between
berberine and FLU, in vitro, against clinical isolates of C. albi-
cans (Iwasaki et al., 2010). However, it was most recently shown
that a combination of berberine and itraconazole was antagonis-
tic against clinical strains of A. fumigatus (Lei et al., 2011). This
antagonism was suggested to result from competition between
berberine and itraconazole in disrupting ergosterol biosynthesis.

Synthetic antifungal chemosensitizers
Amiodarone, a complex benzofuran, was originally identiﬁed
for clinical use to treat heart arrhythmia (Singh and Vaughan
Williams, 1970). However, it was later found to have some nominal
antifungal activity against Aspergillus, Candida, and Cryptococcus
(Courchesne, 2002). In an in vitro study against itraconazole- sus-
ceptible and resistant strains of A. fumigatus, amiodarone and itra-
conazole were highly synergistic, mainly in itraconazole-resistant
strains, achieving an FICI as low as 0.02 with one strain (Afeltra
et al., 2004). It was believed that this synergism resulted from dis-
ruption of sodium ion transport. Amiodarone was next found to
be highly synergistic to FLU, itraconazole and voriconazole against
azole-resistant strains of C. albicans, with FICIs from 0.001 to
0.018 (Guo et al., 2008). However, in combination with azoles
against susceptible strains, interactions were mainly neutral or, in
a few cases, antagonistic. The basis of synergism between amio-
darone and FLU based on gene expression proﬁling revealed that
amiodarone toxicity, alone, to C. albicans was disruption of Ca2+
homeostasis (Gamarra et al., 2010). However, when amiodarone
and FLU were combined, expression of genes normally upregu-
lated to respond to the stresses introduced by either compound,
alone, were attenuated. This suggested that there was some type
of compensatory inhibition of response pathways to counteract
the stresses of either compound. Overall, the outcome of this

interaction was loss of membrane integrity resulting from dimin-
ished ergosterol availability and cellular ion imbalance. The syner-
gism of amiodarone and FLU was also reﬂected in murine model
assays, where cohorts receiving both drugs showed a >4-log reduc-
tion of CFU in kidney biopsies when infected with FLU-resistant
C. albicans.

chemosensitizing

to antimycotic drugs

Another synthetic compound being tested as a poten-
tial
is 7-
chlorotetrazolo[5,1-c]benzo[1,2,4]triazine (CTBT). CTBT was
ﬁrst identiﬁed as a potential chemosensitizer during screening
of synthetic compounds using the multidrug resistant mutant S.
cerevisiae pdr 3-9 (Cernicka et al., 2007). CTBT itself possesses
nominal fungicidal activity and its fungitoxicity does not target
the pleiotropic drug regulator genes, PDR1 and PDR3. However,
in combination with FLU, the MIC of FLU was reduced by twofold
in drug sensitive and resistant C. albicans. The chemosensitizing
effect was also independent of genes associated with multidrug
resistance, including efﬂux pumps, in yeasts; which a number of
other synthetic potential chemosensitizing agents do disrupt (Cer-
nicka et al., 2007; references therein). The chemosensitizing effect
of CTBT was later identiﬁed, based on gene mutant hypersensitiv-
ity assays, to result from induction of oxidative stress. Similar to
natural benzaldehyde analogs discussed above, CTBT appears to
speciﬁcally target mitochondria, as represented by hypersensitivity
of sod2Δ mutants and production of ROS (Batova et al., 2010).
CTBT was also identiﬁed to be a potent chemosensitizing agent
in combination with itraconazole against A. niger, again resulting
from inducing oxidative stress (Culakova et al., 2012).

The synthetic compounds gemﬁbrozil, quinine, and chlor-
promazine, deﬁned as “chemosensitizers,” were found to reduce
the MICs of FLU by sevenfold against reference and clinical
strains of C. albicans (Bulatova and Darwish, 2008). A number
of iron-chelating compounds were found to enhance activity of
antimycotics against A. fumigatus. These included ciclopirox and
deferiprone in combination with ketoconazole, lactoferrin with
AMB, and deferiprone with FLU (Zarember et al., 2009). Tri-
closan, a synthetic chlorinated aromatic compound known to have
antimicrobial activity, was found to synergistically enhance the
activity of FLU against all 24 azole-resistant strains of C. albicans
examined (Yu et al., 2011).

Another tactic for overcoming antifungal drug resistance, or
enhancing efﬁcacy, has involved targeting Hsp90, a molecu-
lar chaperone linked to fungal resistance to both azoles and
echinocandins. Hsp90 is an intermediate in the PKC pathway gov-
erning the stress response to cell wall integrity (LaFayette et al.,
2010). A number of Hsp90 inhibitors related to geldanamycin, a
benzoquinone showing antitumor activity, were tested as antifun-
gal and “chemosensitizing” agents. Both in vitro and in vivo assays
showed that Hsp90 inhibitors have the potential to enhance the
activity of azoles and echinocandins, and overcome any resistance,
to either. In vitro assays using a FLU-resistant strain of C. albi-
cans showed that addition of geldanamycin, or synthetic structural
analogs 17-(allylamino)- or 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)- 17-
demethoxygeldanamycin with FLU overcame resistance and also
enhanced activity of caspofungin against A. fumigatus and A.
terreus. These same Hsp90 inhibitors also showed synergistic inter-
action with caspofungin or FLU against A. fumigatus or C. albicans,

respectively, in in vivo insect model assays, at levels where neither
of the compounds, alone, had antifungal activity (Cowen, 2009;
Cowen et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2009).

(cid:4)

A number of alkyl guanidine analogs, substructures of polyol
antibiotics, were examined for direct fungitoxicity and syner-
gism with AMB. One analog, N -methyl-N
-dodecylguanidine was
found to be a potent synergist of AMB against S. cerevisiae (Ogita
et al., 2007). The synergism was initially identiﬁed to be associ-
ated with disruption of the plasma membrane and generation of
ROS. In a recent examination of this compound in combination
with AMB against C. albicans, it was determined that N -methyl-
N
-dodecylguanidine disrupted ergosterol related activities with
regard to the vacuolar membrane, thus enhancing the fungicidal
effect of AMB (Yutani et al., 2011b).

(cid:4)

Certain peptides examined recently may provide a syner-
gistic elevation of antimycotic activity of selected drugs. Five
cationic antimicrobial peptides were tested in combination with
the echinocandins, caspofungin and anidulafungin, against refer-
ence and clinical strains of C. albicans and C. glabrata (Harris
and Coote, 2010). Of these peptides, dermaseptin S3(1–16) and
ranalexin were found to have the broadest degree of synergistic
interactions with the echinocandins in all strains tested. However,
in murine bioassays of systemic candidiasis using ranalexin and
caspofungin, no synergism was detected.

One of the more novel approaches in the use of synthetic
compounds to augment antimycotic activity of drugs involves
compounds for use in so-called photodynamic therapy (PDT).
PDT agents are compounds that are reactive with visible light
and result in the production of ROS (Mizuno et al., 2011). They
have been proposed as potential antimicrobial agents for treatment
of cutaneous or mucocutaneous mycoses, infections in tissue in
which light can penetrate to some degree. It had been previously
shown that elevation of ROS enhances anticandidal activity of
PDTs (Chabrier-Rosello et al., 2008). In a test of several PDT agents
and azole drugs, used to enhance ROS production, the combina-
tion of miconazole and a PDT agent, the porphyrin TMP-1363,
resulted in prolonging fungistasis against C. albicans, in vitro (Snell
et al., 2011). However, this synergism and its association to elevated
ROS production were not clearly determined.

Lastly, a new class of synthetic bromine-containing compounds
has been shown to have speciﬁc, potent antifungal activity by tar-
geting the fungal sphingolipid pathway. These are currently under-
going clinical evaluation. One of these compounds, N
-(3-bromo-
4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-methylbenzohydrazide (BHBM), has
been found to have a synergistic interaction with FLU (FICI= 0.5)
against C. neoformans (Dr. Maurizio Del Poeta, personal commu-
nication).

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
In the course of reviewing the literature for this chapter it was strik-
ing how often one found almost “boiler plate” type of statements.
Frequently the ﬁrst paragraph of most papers cited the emerg-
ing crisis of resistance to antifungal agents and the slow progress
in developing new ones. And, in an almost universal “chorus,”
the paper would state how important is to perform studies on
chemosensitization to develop new antifungal modes of action, or
new fungal control strategies. Then, almost universally, the theme

of the ﬁnal paragraph would end with a statement to the effect of,
“the results of this study show a promising new strategy for control
of fungal diseases. Further ﬁeld/clinical studies are warranted. . .”
The term “chemosensitization” has a number of synonyms
in the literature, including: “synergizers, enhancers, augmenting
agents, sensitizers, potentiators” and others. There are inherent
difﬁculties in developing antifungal agents that are also not toxic
to the patient. Additional problems in the clinical treatment of
mycoses are the frustrating frequency with which target cells
develop resistance and, in some cases, there is deep-seated and
widespread invasiveness of the infections within the patient. These
factors result in the need for high doses of drugs to achieve effec-
tiveness at the fungal infection site, which should strongly support
research efforts on chemosensitizing agents.

However, there are a number of perplexing attributes concern-
ing the literature on chemosensitization research on antifungal
agents. One of the ﬁrst to be noted was the fair amount of research
in this area being pursued in “pockets,” throughout the globe.
However, by virtue of the fact that many researchers were not
citing each other’s work it seemed that many researchers were
simply unaware of each other. This oversight, however, within
the past year has begun to be remedied. But, to date, no confer-
ences, workshops or books have speciﬁcally focused on antifungal
chemosensitization.

With regard to what appears in most chemosensitization
research papers in their ﬁnal paragraph, all of the papers cited,
here, emphasized the prospects for continuation of the research
with ﬁeld or clinical trials (depending upon agriculture or
medicine). Despite the fact that the ﬁrst papers on antifun-
gal chemosensitization appeared over three decades ago, to date
only a handful of papers have presented results beyond in vitro
Petri dish or microtiter plate assays. A scant few have presented
any in vivo results, all of which were murine or insect model
assays, three showing successful enhancement, allicin+ FLU,
berberine+ AMB, amiodarone+ FLU, and one showing neutral-
ity, caspofungin+ ranalexin and Hsp90 inhibitors+ AMB. To
date, no clinical trials on antifungal chemosensitization have been
reported in the literature; though there are two where chemosen-
sitizers have gone through clinical tests as antifungal agents, alone,
EGCG and garlic extracts.

It is perplexing as to why, after three decades of promising
results on chemosensitization of antifungal agents, nothing has
reached the ﬁeld or clinical stage of trial. One possibility is that
many of the chemosensitizing agents lack speciﬁcity to fungi. Many
of them are generally mildly antimicrobial, or have broader bio-
cidal activity, being antihelminthic or even insecticidal, but only
at rates that far exceed those of their commercial counterparts.
This absence of speciﬁcity may be a harbinger of potential tox-
icity to the host (crop/human patient). However, many of the
chemosensitizing agents discussed are natural compounds found
in spices used in human cuisine, or have been used in folk medi-
cine for centuries. But, many of these “natural” chemosensitizers
have never undergone mammalian toxicity testing beyond the
oral level; which would include intravenous or intraperitoneal
tests.

We are now beginning to see a new group of antifungal
chemosensitizers. These are the synthetic compounds. Perhaps,

as these show more promise and greater speciﬁcity toward fungi,
there will be a greater commercial and/or clinical interest in devel-
oping them for use in concert with appropriate commercial anti-
fungal agents. It is with this in mind that some encouragement

should be placed upon a closer relationship between industry,
academia and government labs to look further into the promis-
ing attributes of chemosensitizing agents to improve efﬁcacy of
available antifungal agents.
