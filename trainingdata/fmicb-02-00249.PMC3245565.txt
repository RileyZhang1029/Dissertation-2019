A cold methane seep was discovered in a forearc sediment basin off the island Sumatra,
exhibiting a methane-seep adapted microbial community. A deﬁned seep center of activity,
like in mud volcanoes, was not discovered. The seep area was rather characterized by a
patchy distribution of active spots.The relevance of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM)
was reﬂected by 13C-depleted isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon.The anaer-
obic conversion of methane to CO2 was conﬁrmed in a 13C-labeling experiment. Methane
fueled a vital microbial community with cell numbers of up to 4× 109 cells cm−3 sediment.
The microbial community was analyzed by total cell counting, catalyzed reporter deposition–
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (CARD–FISH), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CARD–FISH cell counts and qPCR mea-
surements showed the presence of Bacteria and Archaea, but only small numbers of
Eukarya. The archaeal community comprised largely members of ANME-1 and ANME-2.
Furthermore, members of the Crenarchaeota were frequently detected in the DGGE analy-
sis. Three major bacterial phylogenetic groups (δ-Proteobacteria, candidate division OP9,
and Anaerolineaceae) were abundant across the study area. Several of these sequences
were closely related to the genus Desulfococcus of the family Desulfobacteraceae, which
is in good agreement with previously described AOM sites. In conclusion, the majority of
the microbial community at the seep consisted of AOM-related microorganisms, while the
relevance of higher hydrocarbons as microbial substrates was negligible.

INTRODUCTION
Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) has been described for
decades, but became accepted as a key process in anaerobic car-
bon cycling only during the last 15 years (Davis and Yarbrough,
1966; Barnes and Goldberg, 1976; Reeburgh, 1976, 2007; Knittel
and Boetius, 2009). So far, it has been observed in many marine
environments contributing signiﬁcantly to carbon cycling in the
sediments and the reduction of methane emissions. Continental
margins and their forelands were examined in numerous biogeo-
chemical studies (e.g., Bohrmann et al., 1998; Reed et al., 2002;
Inagaki et al., 2006) and AOM was associated mainly to gas seeps
and mud volcanoes (Aloisi et al., 2000; Joye et al., 2004; Valentine
et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006b; Lösekann et al., 2007). Such
cold seep ecosystems, especially in the Eel River Basin (Orphan
et al., 2002), the Hydrate Ridge (Bohrmann et al., 1998), the Black
Sea (Michaelis et al., 2002), and the Gulf of Mexico (Roberts
and Aharon, 1994), have been intensively studied regarding the
geochemistry and microbiology of AOM. Within these AOM
ecosystems, ANaerobic MEthanotrophs (ANME) populations are
often the prevailing constituents and drive the biogeochemical
processes.

In sediment systems with diffusive methane ﬂuxes, the distribu-
tion of ANME is restricted to the sulfate–methane transition zone

(SMTZ), the only place where both methane and sulfate are avail-
able. The ANME populations and their sulfate-reducing partner
bacteria are principally the same as those at cold seeps. How-
ever, cell numbers and activities of AOM-related populations are
signiﬁcantly lower (Knittel and Boetius, 2009).

Although the importance of AOM in a global context has
been widely recognized, the process is on a mechanistical and
physiological level still not very well understood (Thauer, 2011).
In the initial AOM reports, methanogenesis and sulfate reduc-
tion were believed to be mutually exclusive processes (Martens
and Berner, 1974). However, AOM coincides with methano-
genesis (Krüger et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006b), and was
therefore proposed to be reverse methanogenesis (Krüger et al.,
2003; Scheller et al., 2010). So far, it was demonstrated that
sulfate and nitrite reduction couple to AOM as a joint process
of specialized methane oxidizers and sulfate- or nitrite-reducing
microorganisms (Boetius et al., 2000; Raghoebarsing et al., 2006;
Ettwig et al., 2010). Metal reduction coupled to AOM was also
suggested (Beal et al., 2009). Phylogenetic analysis of AOM-
sediments identiﬁed three novel groups of so-called ANME-
Archaea, ANME-1, ANME-2, and ANME-3. These ANME are
distantly related to cultivated methanogenic members from the
orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales (Orphan et al.,

AOM in the Sumatra forearc

2002; Knittel et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006b). FISH techniques
showed that ANME occur in aggregates (Boetius et al., 2000;
Michaelis et al., 2002; Knittel et al., 2005) with bacteria related
to Desulfosarcina–Desulfococcus or Desulfobulbus. These ﬁndings
suggest that AOM coupled to sulfate reduction is a syntrophic
process, in which ANME convert methane to a metabolite which
is used as electron donor by the sulfate-reducing bacterial partner.
The Sumatra forearc is spatially remote from previous study
sites. Therefore, our main objective on the R/V Sonne cruise
SO189-2 into the Sumatra forearc basins was to detect and inves-
tigate methane seeps on the seaﬂoor, and to describe the related
geochemical and microbiological features in comparison to back-
ground sediments of nearby sites. After the successful ﬁrst-time
discovery of a methane-driven cold seep in this geographical
region, we analyzed different biogeochemical proxies for AOM
to determine related microbial activities. This was combined with
molecular biological methods to study the involved microbial pop-
ulations, to allow a comparison of the present results with those
already published on other seep sites worldwide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SITE DESCRIPTION AND SAMPLING
General features of the Simeulue and the Nias Basin in the Sumatra
forearc are described in Sieh and Natawitjaja (2000) and Schippers
et al. (2010). Focus of this study is an area without seismic reﬂec-
tions (“seismic blanking”) discovered SE of the Simeulue basin,
indicating free gases in the sediment (Figures 1 and 2). Measure-
ments of dissolved gas of samples taken from the water column
indicated elevated methane concentrations in the water column
in this area (Wiedicke-Hombach et al., 2006). Additionally, pic-
tures and samples from the seaﬂoor revealed a typical seep fauna
comprising mainly bivalves and white crabs (Martin and Haney,
2005), colonizing outcropping carbonate precipitations, and the
surrounding sediments.

the sediment surface of the station 2.

During the R/V Sonne cruise SO189-2 in 2006, nine sediment
stations were sampled at the suspected seep area in the Simeulue
basin, a reference site, and also in the Nias basin as summarized
in Table 1. The sediment was sampled using a 6-m long gravity
corer (SL), a 0.5 m long multicorer (MC), and a TV camera guided
0.9 m× 0.9 m grab (TV). The sediment in the TV-grab was further
sampled using hand-held small pushcores.

BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES
Immediately after porewater sampling (see Geochemical Analy-
ses), approx. 300–400 ml sediment samples of multicorer or 20–
100 ml sediment of gravity cores were collected in glass bottles.
Bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and plastic screw
caps. The headspace was ﬂushed with nitrogen gas. These “live”
samples for sediment microcosm were stored and transported at
4˚C until further on-shore processing. For quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
community analysis, parallel samples were frozen onboard at
−20˚C. For ﬂuorescence microscopic methods, samples were
treated as described below.

INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE MICROBIAL ACTIVITY IN
SEDIMENT MICROCOSMS
An overview over the experimental setup of the microcosms is
displayed in Table 2.

General slurry preparation and microcosm inoculation
To prepare slurries for inoculation, sediment samples were mixed
1:1 with artiﬁcial seawater medium (Widdel and Bak, 1992).
Subsequently, 10 ml of sediment slurry were added to 20 ml of
medium, resulting in 5 ml sediment per bottle. Serum bottles of
60 ml volume were used. All manipulations were carried out under
dinitrogen atmosphere in an anoxic glove box at room tempera-
ture. The headspace of the incubation tubes consisted of either
methane (100%) or N2/CO2 (90%/10%v/v). These microcosms
were incubated horizontally in the dark without shaking at in situ
temperature which was either 6 or 23˚C (Table 1).

Monitoring of AOM microcosms and determination of sulfate
reduction rates
Anaerobic oxidation of methane was measured in vitro by
methane-dependent sulfate reduction unless stated otherwise
(Nauhaus et al., 2002; Krüger et al., 2005; Treude et al., 2005).
Sulﬁde concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically
by the formation of copper sulﬁde (Cord-Ruwisch, 1985). Sulﬁde
concentrations of methane amended microcosms were subtracted
from sulﬁde concentrations of controls without methane before
−1 wet sed-
rates were calculated. Rates are given in μmol cm
iment and deviations are expressed as 95% conﬁdence intervals
unless stated otherwise.

AOM labeling experiment with 13C-methane
For further veriﬁcation of AOM activity, 13C-labeled methane
(17%v/v) was added to two ﬁrst transfer microcosms (stations 1
and 2). After 14 months of incubation of the transfers, a 10-ml
headspace sample was precipitated in 1 ml concentrated BaOH
solution. The obtained BaCO3 suspension was transferred to a

To determine the δ13C value, a nearly methane-free headspace
sample was injected into a MAT 252 GC-IRMS. Mean δ13C values
were obtained from three individual batch cultures.

Determination of methanogenesis from TMA, methanol, and
different hydrocarbons
Potential rates of methane production were determined in
microcosms without substrates, with addition of typical marine
substrates trimethylamine (TMA) and methanol, or selected
hydrocarbons. Final concentrations in the microcosms for
TMA and methanol were 1 and 2.4 mM. To demonstrate

hydrocarbon-dependent methanogenesis, anaerobic microcosms
with butane, hexadecane, and ethylbenzene were prepared. Butane
was added by replacing the microcosm headspace completely by
gaseous butane. Hexadecane or ethylbenzene were added directly
to the medium in concentrations of 0.1%v/v. Methane was mea-
sured using a GC–FID equipped with a silica gel column (SRI 8610

To simulate marine in situ conditions, all initial setups con-
tained sulfate (28 mM) as electron acceptor. Alternatively applied
electron acceptors to sulfate were nitrate (1 mM), ferrihydrite

was precipitated by neutralization of a FeCl3 solution (Lovley
and Phillips, 1986). Manganese dioxide was prepared by oxidation
of a MnCl2 solution with KMnO4 (Lovley and Phillips, 1988).
Hydrocarbon degradation was not measured directly. Methano-
genesis served as proxy for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation
(Zengler et al., 1999; Siegert et al., 2011). Methane concentrations
were measured after 2 months (TMA and methanol) or 7 months
(hydrocarbons).

DETERMINATION OF CELL NUMBERS BY SYBR GREEN® AND
CARD–FISH
For SYBR Green® total cell counts and catalyzed reporter
deposition–ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (CARD–FISH), ﬁx-
ations were carried out immediately after sampling. Two ﬁxatives,
either formaldehyde (FA) or ethanol, were applied each. A volume
of 1 cm3 wet sediment was treated for 10–15 h at 4˚C with 1 ml
ﬁxative solution [4%w/v FA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)],
removed in two centrifugation steps by washing with 1 ml PBS and
stored at−20˚C in 50%v/v ethanol/PBS. Samples were transported

to the home laboratory on dry ice. For total cell counts, in each
sample 800–1000 cells were counted after SYBR Green® staining
according to Weinbauer et al. (1998). CARD–FISH counts were
conducted as described in Pernthaler et al. (2002) and Schippers
et al. (2005).

GENE QUANTIFICATION BY qPCR
DNA extraction was carried out using a Fast DNA for Soil Kit (BIO
101, MP Biomedicals, Germany). To block sedimentary nucleic
acid binding capacities, 10 μl of a 1% polyadenylic acid solution
were added in the initial step (Webster et al., 2003). Directly before
PCR, 125 μl of 0.3% bovine serum albumine (BSA) in ultra pure
water were added as blocking agent to the Taqman master mix
(Applied Biosystems, Germany) or the SYBR green® master mix
(Eurogenetec, Germany). A real-time PCR instrument (ABI Prism
7000, Applied Biosystems) was employed to determine the 16S

rRNA gene copy numbers of Archaea (Takai and Horikoshi, 2000)
and Bacteria (Nadkarni et al., 2002). Eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes
were quantiﬁed according to the manual’s instructions of the kit
and cited literature therein (Applied Biosystems, 2002). The func-
tional genes dsrA and mcrA were investigated according to Schip-
pers and Nerretin (2006) and Nunoura et al. (2006) respectively.
Speciﬁc functional mcrA genes from anaerobic methanotrophic
Archaea ANME-1 and ANME-2 were quantiﬁed using assays of
Nunoura et al. (2006). Values are expressed in copy numbers per
cm3 wet sediment.

System (BioRad, Germany) for 20 h at 60˚C. Denaturing gradi-
ents of urea/formamide were 30–70%w/v (20–80%w/v for Archaea)
and the acrylamide concentration was 6.5%w/v. Dominant bands
were excised and stored at −20˚C, vacuum-dried at 60˚C for 3 h

GenBank database2 under accession numbers HQ231693 (see text
footnote 2) to HQ231746 (see text footnote 2).

BATHYMETRY AND PARASOUND
A Kongsberg SMRAD EM 120 multibeam echosounder was oper-
−1 during the cruise. The device enabled
ated continuously 24 h day
mapping to full ocean depth with a sonar frequency of 12 kHz,
an angular coverage of 150˚ and 191 beams per ping. The para-
sound device vessel integrate (Krupp Atlas Electronics, Germany)
was used as a low frequency sediment echosounder at 18.0 and
21.5 kHz to map seismic proﬁles of basin sediments. The transpar-
ent character of the seaﬂoor (seismic blanking) was found to be
indicative for deﬁning the extent of sediments affected by methane
seepage and authigenic carbonate precipitation (Figure 2). How-
ever, seismic blanking may as well be indicative for high density gas
hydrates overlaying low density free gas, unveiled by a bottom sim-
ulating reﬂector (BSR; Hyndman and Spence, 1992; Berndt et al.,
2004). Nevertheless, seismic blanking does not always indicate free
gas in the sediment (Zühlsdorff et al., 1999).

GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES
Duplicate sediment core samples were taken for microbiological
and geochemical analyses. TOC was measured with the instru-
ment LECO CS 200 (LECO Corporation, USA). Porewater was
squeezed from sediment slices of up to 125 cm3 using a pore-
water press at atmospheric pressure. Between 20 and 40 ml of
porewater were obtained and ﬁltered through a 0.45 μm cellu-
lose nitrate ﬁlter (Sartorius, Germany) and directly collected in
polypropylene-vials. Polypropylene-vials were acid prewashed and
dried to remove possible traces of carbonate from the vial surface.
To remove particles and microorganisms, the collected porewater
was ﬁltered again through 0.2 μm polyethersulfone ﬁlters (Sar-
torius, Germany). For metal ion and sulfate concentrations, 5 ml
porewater were acidiﬁed with 50 μl HNO3 and measured using
an ICP-MS instrument (Perkin Elmer Sciex Elan 5000, USA) as
published by Dekov et al. (2006). After preservation of the sed-
iment samples with ZnCl2, porewater sulﬁde was determined
spectrophotometrically as described by Cline (1969).

To determine carbon stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic car-
bon (DIC), 2 ml of porewater, treated with 10 μl saturated HgCl2
solution on board, were analyzed in a Finnigan MAT 252 (Thermo
Electron, USA) connected to a Finnigan Kiel III (Thermo Elec-
tron) carbonate preparation device (Wachter and Hayes, 1985).
Free gases were measured using 5 ml fresh sediment from the cen-
ter of the core which was immediately transferred into 10 ml 2 M
NaOH in a 56 ml serum bottle. The bottle was sealed quickly with

1http://www.arb-silva.de
2http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

a butyl rubber stopper and the sediment was suspended by shaking
the ﬂask. Immediately, 5 ml headspace were removed and stored
upside down in 20 ml injection vials over saturated NaCl solution
for on-shore measurement. This procedure allowed a separation
of free from adsorbed gases but some adsorbed gas may have
evaporated as well (Faber and Stahl, 1983). δ13C values for free
gases were obtained by direct injection into a Finnigan MAT 253
(Thermo Electron, USA) connected to a gas chromatograph (GC
6890, Agilent, USA).

To determine the carbon stable isotopic composition of the
macro fauna, the soft tissues of bivalves and crabs were freeze
dried, milled, weighed into tin capsules, and stored in a desicca-
tor until measurement. Samples were taken from one individual
bivalve and two individual crabs. One crab was sampled twice
and the other one was sampled once. For TOC carbon isotope
ratios, dried sediment was treated with 10% HCl in acid washed
tin capsules and stored in a desiccator until measurement. Iso-
tope ratios were determined by a coupled system of an elemental
analyzer and a MAT 252 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo
Electron, USA) via a Finnigan ConFlo III open split interface. Con-
centrations and isotopic data are given as the arithmetic mean of
at least two measurements. Isotopic carbon values are expressed in
‰ relative to Vienna PeeDeeBelemnite (VPDB). Concentrations
are relative to 1 cm3 of fresh (wet) sediment.

RESULTS
SEAFLOOR OBSERVATIONS
Areas covered with white-colored microbial mats were discov-
ered and sampled in the Simeulue seep area using a TV-guided
grab (Table 1; Figure 1). In the seep area, parts of the sediment
were characterized by a black color and a strong sulﬁdic odor. The
higher seaﬂoor biota comprised tubeworms, bivalves, and crabs.
The latter colonized carbonate outcrops and could be identiﬁed as
members of the species Shinkaia crosnieri (Enrique Macpherson,
personal communication). Their soft tissue stable carbon isotopic
signature ranged from −31 to −45‰. Soft tissue of one mytilid
bivalve individual had a δ13C of −31‰.

FREE GASES AND THEIR ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION
Free methane concentrations in the water column ranged from
−1 at the seep location as shown in Figure 1. In
10 to 200 nmol l
the southeast boundary of the seep, methane concentration never
−1. At the sediment surface of the
reached values above 5 nmol l
station 1 and 2, methane accounted for a total of >99.9% of all
hydrocarbon gases. Isotopic data of gases sampled at the methane
seep are listed in Table 3.

POREWATER COMPOSITION AND STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES
All geochemical porewater data of the Simeulue seep are summa-
rized in Figure 3. At stations 1 and 2, δ13CDIC values were mainly
below −40‰. At the station 3, δ13CDIC values were always above
−8‰. At station 4, δ13CDIC values ranged from −2‰ at 6 cmbsf
to −24‰ at 293 cmbsf. However, a clearly decreasing trend was

were missing in case of the solid phase δ13CTOC values. However,
there was a slight decrease from −22.3‰ at 6 cmbsf to −27.6‰

Errors are SD from the mean of the given number of replicates (repl). Methane concentrations and carbon isotopic ratios of methane (δ13CCH4
) were determined in
separate measurements and the number of replicates differs. All gas concentrations are approximate values because TV grabs and gravity cores were not pressure
locked and therefore affected by outgassing. Ethane concentrations were determined in the same measurement as carbon isotopic ratios of methane, and the number
of replicates is therefore identical. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) of microcosms with methane in their headspaces were determined in ﬁve replicate microcosms of
which the mean and errors are given within 95% conﬁdence limits. SRR were calculated using sulﬁde concentrations that were subtracted from incubation without
methane. The Student’s t-test was conducted using paired samples (e.g., manganese with methane and manganese without methane) in a one tailed calculation of
the full ﬁve sample population. n/a, not applicable; cmbsf, centimeters below seaﬂoor; repl., number of replicate measurements.

and 2, sulfate concentrations decreased with depth while sulﬁde
concentrations increased. At the stations 3 and 4, neither such a
decline of porewater sulfate concentrations was found, nor was
sulﬁde detected. Elevated concentrations of reduced manganese
were found at the station 2 as well as at the surface of the station 4
(Figure 3). Except for the station 1, no higher amounts of reduced
iron in the porewater were observed (Figure 3).

ANAEROBIC OXIDATION OF METHANE
Results obtained from microcosm experiments do not necessarily
reﬂect the in situ situation but provide an estimate of microbial
activity (Krüger et al., 2005; Treude et al., 2005). Sulfate reduction
rates (SRR) in Simeulue seep sediment microcosms were higher
with methane as electron donor than in controls without methane
and the difference is shown in Table 3. The observed differences
can be explained by AOM. However, sulfate reduction at station
−1,
1 and 2 without methane was 0.13 and 0.11 μmol cm
respectively. To conﬁrm this, the conversion of methane into car-
bon dioxide was tested in 1:10 diluted subcultures of the initial
13C-methane. The label was
microcosms incubated with 17%v/v
recovered as 13C-enriched carbon dioxide. The detected δ13CCO2
values were +503± 331‰ (station 1) and +319± 279‰ (sta-
tion 2) for microcosms prepared from sulﬁdic sediments of the
Simeulue methane seep. This provides evidence for the oxidation
of 13C-methane to 13CO2 at both stations. In controls with unla-
beled methane, δ13CCO2 values were −15.7 and −17.4‰ respec-
tively. The corresponding δ13CCH4 values of unlabeled methane
were −36.6 and −34.9‰ respectively.

In 1:10 diluted subcultures of the initial microcosms, con-
taining sulfate, nitrate, FeOOH, or MnO2, methanotrophy was
observed after 14 months incubation as well. The methanotrophic
rates, measured by headspace analysis of methane, were similar and

to 1.8 μmol cm

METHANOGENESIS FROM TRIMETHYLAMINE (TMA), METHANOL,
HYDROCARBONS
Except station 5, methanogenesis in microcosms without added
methanogenic substrates (TMA, methanol, or hydrocarbons) was
−1 (Table 4). However, when
less than 1.8 nmol methane cm
TMA or methanol were added to microcosms of the seep sta-
tions (1, 2, 5, and 7), methanogenesis increased by two orders
of magnitude. The other seep stations (3, 4, and 6) were not
tested for TMA or methanol methanogenesis. In microcosms
prepared from sediments of the Nias basin, where no methane
seepage was observed (stations 8 and 9), TMA or methanol
did not stimulate methanogenesis. For the hydrocarbon sub-
strates butane, hexadecane, and ethylbenzene, little methanogen-
esis was observed after 7 months incubation in 27 microcosms
out of 280 initial microcosms (Table 4). To exclude false positive
signals by means of stimulation of methanogenic TOC digest-
ing microorganisms the hydrocarbon microcosms were com-
pared with microcosms without hydrocarbons. For this, ﬁrst
1:10 transfers of the methanogenic microcosms were prepared.
In ﬁrst transfers, the hydrocarbon-dependent methanogenesis

rate at the seep station 2 was 6.5 nmol cm

For functional genes, a trend with depth was observed only at
the deeper sampled station 4. Its most prominent feature was the
increase of all mcrA gene copy numbers, beginning at 103 cmbsf
down to 267 cmbsf, and dropping again to the values at the surface
further below. An opposite tendency was observed for dsrA gene
copy numbers showing a clear decrease with depth. At station 2,
ANME-2 mcrA gene copies increased from 6× 106 copies cm
−3
in the top layer to 2× 108 copies cm
−3 at the bottom (8 cmbsf).
An opposite trend appeared for the ANME-1 mcrA gene with
copy numbers of 2× 108 copies cm
−3 at the surface layer and
7× 107 copies cm
−3 at the bottom. No change with depth was
observed for the Methanosarcina mcrA group where copy numbers
of 5× 108 copies cm
−3 were detected. The dsrA gene measurement
resulted in copy numbers of 3× 106 copies cm
−3 at the top and
6× 107 copies cm
−3 at the bottom of this core.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY
Parsimony trees of 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from DGGE
separation of extracted DNA from Simeulue sediment stations
are depicted in Figures 5 and 6. PCR products of the station 3
were run on a separate gel without reference to the stations 1 and
2. Therefore, band patterns were not comparable and a DGGE
gel photograph is not shown. Stations 1, 2, and 4 are shown in
Figure 5.

Three major bacterial phylogenetic groups (δ-Proteobacteria,
candidate division OP9, and Anaerolineaceae) were abundant
across the study area. According to their band thickness in
the DGGE gel, OP9 bacteria, and relatives of Desulfobacteraceae
seemed to become increasingly important with depth at the sta-
tion 4 (Figures 4 and 5). Nonetheless, since band thickness is
an imprecise measure for abundance, this result indicates only a
trend, despite the fact that when the total amount of ampliﬁed
DNA products was equal for each layer. Besides δ-Proteobacteria,
other Proteobacteria sequences were not recovered from the DGGE
gels. Sequences afﬁliated to the clusters Desulfobacteraceae, Desul-
farculaceae, and Sh765B-TzT-29 dominated the δ-Proteobacteria
(Figure 5). One deeply branching sequence of the station 2 was
more closely related to sequences obtained from municipal waste-
water sludge (Rivière et al., 2009) than to the genus Leptolinea
(Figure 6). Another deeply branching sequence of the station 3
was closely related to the genus Rhodococcus (Figure 6). Two bands
found at stations 2, 3, and 4 were relatively close relatives of the
genus Spirochaeta.

Simeulue seep sequences of all stations were related to three
prominent archaeal groups (ANME-1, ANME-2, and Crenar-
chaeota; Figure 7). One sequence of the station 3 was assigned into
the Deep Hydrothermal Vent Euryarchaeotal Group 6 (DHVEG6).
The remaining sequences (stations 3 and 4) belonged to not further
speciﬁed Crenarchaeota. Except for the Crenarchaeota, members of
all other clusters were identiﬁed in stations 1–4. In summary, the
bacterial diversity was greater than the archaeal one, with most
sequences related to organisms typically found at methane and
hydrocarbon seeps or mud volcanoes.

DISCUSSION
For the ﬁrst time, an active methane seep was discovered in
the Indian Ocean. The discovered seep comprised highly active

(stations 1 and 2) and less active or inactive (stations 3 and
4) AOM-inﬂuenced areas (Table 1; Figure 4). The highly active
stations 1 and 2 were characterized by black sulﬁdic surface
sediments, depleted sulfate, and high sulﬁde concentrations and
light δ13CDIC values of the porewater, the presence of ANME-1
and ANME-2 representatives, as well as high cell and high copy
numbers of 16S rRNA and functional genes related to AOM,
methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction. A deﬁned seep center of
activity, like in mud volcanoes, was not discovered, the seep area
was rather characterized by a patchy distribution of active spots.
Carbonate- or sulﬁde-rich spots were distributed randomly over
the surface. A reason for the patchiness might be tectonic activ-
ity. While some gas conduits might have been shut, other could
have opened over time. An apparent feature of the active parts
at the seep was the strong depletion of 13C in DIC, which was
also observed for TOC of the guts of the seep’s macro fauna.
This conﬁrms the importance of methane as carbon source for
the benthos at this location. In addition, methanogenic activ-
ity was conﬁrmed in sediment microcosms of the Simeulue
seep area as well as in the Nias basin, where AOM activity was
absent.

METHANOTROPHY AND SULFATE REDUCTION ACTIVITIES AT THE SEEP
STATIONS
Methane is an indirect electron source for dissimilatory micro-
bial sulfate reducers in the syntrophic process of AOM (Knittel
and Boetius, 2009). The terminal reaction products are carbon-
ate and sulﬁde. The produced sulﬁde in turn may be oxidized at
the oxic/anoxic interface near the sediment surface. White, some-
times ﬁlamentous sulﬁde-oxidizing bacteria are typical indicators
for this interface (Niemann et al., 2006b). Areas covered with such
white-colored microbial mats were discovered in the Simeulue
basin and sampled in their proximity using a TV-guided grab (sta-
tion 2, Figure 1). In contrast, microbial mats were absent near
the station 1. Most likely, the white color of such mats is a result
of intracellular sulfur inclusions as observed in Thioploca, Beggia-
toa, or Thiomargarita aggregates, regularly found on the surface
of sulﬁde-rich marine sediments (Gallardo, 1977; Jannasch et al.,
1989; Schulz et al., 1999).

At the Simeulue seep, methane was probably a carbon source for
higher biota, as indicated by their 13C-depleted carbon signatures.
However, the δ13C (−31 to −45‰) values of the sampled crab
guts indicate a mixed carbon source originating from AOM and

water column carbon ( δ13CCH4 −70.9 to 74.8‰, δ13CDIC −0.8
to −48.8‰, δ13CTOC −22.3 to 27.6‰). Heterotrophic processes

as well as symbiosis between methanotrophic microorganisms
and macrofauna are well described for several hot and cold deep
marine vents (Childress et al., 1986; Duperron et al., 2005; Petersen
and Dubilier, 2009). AOM was clearly a carbon donating process.
It has been previously demonstrated that more than 99% of the
methane in AOM systems is used for energy metabolism (Wegener
et al., 2008). The oxidized carbon is than excreted as carbonate
and probably reassimilated into biomass. The same seems likely
for the Simeulue invertebrate community as previously shown

for symbiotic CO2-ﬁxing microorganisms and the gutless worm
Olavius (Blazejak et al., 2005). Symbiosis of higher benthos and
methanotrophic microorganisms is also often associated with aer-
obic methanotrophy (Childress et al., 1986; Duperron et al., 2005;
Niemann et al., 2006b; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009). However,
the DGGE 16S rRNA gene analyses, focusing on dominant bands,
did not reveal aerobic methane oxidizers in the seep sediments
(Figures 5 and 6).

The anoxic nature of the sediment was conﬁrmed by pore-
water data, showing in particular high sulﬁde concentrations,
reduced iron, and manganese as well as ammonium to be present

(Figure 3). While sulﬁde concentrations increased downward into
the sediment, sulfate decreased to micromolar concentrations.
However, a clear SMTZ was not observed.

Large amounts of dissolved gas with strong sulﬁdic odor evap-
orated from the sediment during sampling of the stations 1 and
2. Indicators for ongoing AOM at stations 1 and 2 were the low
δ13CDIC values in the porewater apparently derived from 13C-
depleted methane (Tables 2 and 3). These values were comparable
to other methane inﬂuenced seeps, as in the Gulf of Mexico
(Cofﬁn et al., 2008) or at the Hydrate Ridge (Valentine et al.,
2005). Since ocean water δ13CDIC values are usually between 0 and
−10‰ (Deuser et al., 1968), DIC at the Simeulue seep was obvi-
ously derived from the anaerobic oxidation of upward migrating
methane (Figure 3). δ13CCH4 values were below −70‰ at the
methane exhibits δ13CCH4 values below −70‰ (Whiticar et al.,

stations 1 and 2 (Table 3). It is commonly agreed that biogenic

1986). Hence, the observed methane at the Simeulue seep was
likely biogenic methane as well.

The AOM rates observed for the Simeulue seep area were
slightly lower than maximum rates reported for other methane
seeps, but higher than rates observed for mud volcanoes or
sediments from various marine SMTZ (Knittel and Boetius, 2009).
That methane rather than TOC was the carbon source for
microorganisms is supported by low δ13CTOC values at station
1 and 2. These values were in a narrow range between −22.7 and
−24.5‰ which are typical for marine cellular carbon (Deuser
et al., 1968; Rice, 1993). These values contrast δ13CDIC values
between −11.8 and −48.8‰ at the stations 1 and 2, most of them

below −40.0‰ (Figure 3). Since the carbon isotopic composition
of methane at both sites was below−70.0‰ (Table 3), it is obvious
that AOM contributed to the DIC budget at these active AOM sites.
The calculated SRR in the equilibrium zone, i.e., the zone of sul-
fur input from sulfate does not exceed the SRR, and was between

−1 at

8 cmbsf. The ﬂuid ﬂux was assumed to be 10 cm year
et al., 2003) and the equilibrium was reached when the sum of sul-
ﬁde and sulfate concentrations did not exceed the bottom water
concentration of sulfate any more (27.79 mM, Figure 3). More-
over, the seep sediments were highly methane laden, as indicated
by intensive gas emission during sampling. Huge discrepancies
between sulfate reduction and AOM rates are usually observed
only when methane plays a minor role in the investigated system
(Niemann et al., 2006a), which is not the case here.

However, one may expect that there would have been a greater
contribution of AOM derived carbon to TOC as observed, as
methane was apparently a carbon source for the AOM performing
microorganisms. Wegener et al. (2008) reported the assimilation of
methane derived carbon into AOM performing microbial consor-
tia of various geographic origins via CO2 ﬁxation. Furthermore,
they could show that methane mostly serves microbial catabolism
and to little extent microbial anabolism. This is also reﬂected in
carbon stable isotopic signatures of DIC and TOC of the Simeu-
lue seep, where stronger methane signals were detected in DIC
and low δ13CTOC values do not support a signiﬁcant impact of
methane derived carbon to TOC (Table 3; Figure 3). On the
other hand, ammonium concentrations decrease between 6 and

TOC degradation for energy metabolism, (ii) hypothetical anaer-
obic ammonium oxidation with sulfate (Schrum et al., 2009),
or (iii) ammonium uptake due to the increase of biomass upon
AOM. TOC degradation would liberate ammonium and can be
excluded (e.g.,Wehrmann et al., 2011). Anaerobic ammonium oxi-
dation with sulfate was suggested based on geochemical sediment

proﬁles (Schrum et al., 2009; Wehrmann et al., 2011) but has not
been convincingly demonstrated in vitro yet. However, it would
have a stoichiometry of 1 mol sulfate reduced to 2.67 mol ammo-
nium oxidized. From 4 to 6 cmbsf, the stoichiometry is 1–6.47 mol
(Figure 3). That would indicate either an inefﬁcient ammonium
oxidation or a contribution of AOM to the ammonium decline.

(2009).

Since at station 4 AOM was not reﬂected by the porewater
chemistry we postulate a former, recently ceased AOM activ-
ity, which has left its imprint in the carbon isotope signatures
and ANME-related 16S rRNA gene biomarkers. Consequently, the

δ13CTOC values below −27‰ are suggestive for a greater contri-

bution of methane to TOC compared to DIC than observed for
the stations 1 and 2 (Figure 3). AOM driven microbial activity, as
indicated by an increase of ANME members with sediment depth
(Figure 4), could have caused a stronger methane signal in TOC
when methane was the prevailing carbon and energy source. More-
over, the impact of TOC of the water column is presumably much
lower at a depth of 150–300 cmbsf than closer to the sediment
surface. Methane was relatively enriched in 13C at this station,
which could also be well explained by AOM activity. Extremely
low methane concentrations could have led to a less pronounced
isotopic fractionation effect (Holler et al., 2009) – caused by rate
limiting methane concentrations (Table 3).

A number of in vitro experiments could conﬁrm AOM as
an important process at the discovered methane seep. Anaer-
obic methanotrophy was observed in initial and in transferred
microcosms, as indicated by labeling experiments as well as by
methane-dependent SRR (Table 3). That sulfate reduction was
mainly driven by methane was further supported by the observa-
tion of comparable TOC values in the sediments of both, stations 1
and 2 as well as station 4 (Figure 3). If TOC degraders signiﬁcantly
accounted for sulfate reduction, depleted sulfate and high sulﬁde
concentration would have been measured for station 4 as well,
and not only for the stations 1 and 2 for which sulfate reduction
via active AOM could be demonstrated. The higher rates in the
ﬁrst transferred microcosms indicated an enrichment of methan-
otrophs in these assays after incubation for more than 1 year as
indicated by labeling experiments using 13C-methane.

Moreover, relatively high concentrations of reduced man-
ganese were detected at station 2 (Figure 3). The presence of
reduced manganese may be an indication for sulﬁde dependent or
direct microbial manganese reduction. Sulﬁde dependent or direct
microbial manganese reduction was probably a result of AOM
activity at the Simeulue seep as suggested for the Eel river basin by
Beal et al. (2009). Additionally, one sequence of the station 2 and
four sequences of the station 3 were assigned to the Sh765B-TzT-29
cluster, a cluster that was initially believed to belong to the fam-
ily Geobacteraceae and was ﬁrst described by Geißler (2003). This
cluster contains heavy metal associated Bacteria which where orig-
inally found in uranium mill tailings at Shiprock (NM, USA).
A recent study described metal associated AOM consortia (Beal
et al., 2009). Members of the Sh765B-TzT-29 cluster may also be
metal associated at the Simeulue seep. Ádditionally, our culturing
experiments with oxidized metals showed oxidation of methane,
possibly associated to the Sh765B-TzT-29 cluster. Moreover, 16S
rRNA gene sequences reported by Beal et al. (2009) were found in a
close phylogenetic neighborhood of operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) identiﬁed in the Simeulue seep (Figure 6). In conjunction

with the presence of reduced iron and manganese in the porewater
(Figure 3), it seems possible that metal reduction played a role as
electron acceptor, besides sulfate, for AOM.

MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AT THE SEEP STATIONS
Anaerobic oxidation of methane supported a vital microbial com-
munity as demonstrated by 13C-methane labeling experiments,
rate measurements in vitro, rate estimations in situ, the presence
of ANME-related mcrA genes, and an active archaeal and bac-
terial community at stations 1 and 2 (Figure 4). Many archaeal
sequences obtained from the Simeulue seep stations 1 to 4, were
distributed over the ANME-1 and -2 clusters (Figure 7). OTUs
from the stations 1 and 2 were assigned to ANME-1b and ANME-
2b clusters. Also at the station 3, ANME-2a/c members were
identiﬁed. Furthermore, members of the Crenarchaeota were fre-
quently detected in the DGGE analysis at both AOM-stations and
the station 3. The occurrence of Crenarchaeota at a methane seep
is not unusual and has been reported for other sites (Knittel et al.,
2005; Knittel and Boetius, 2009).

Most bacterial groups belonged to the family Anaerolineaceae
(phylum Chloroﬂexi), the candidate division OP9 (Webster et al.,
2004) and the class δ-Proteobacteria. These groups have been
described to be dominant in marine sediments (Teske, 2006;
Blazejak and Schippers, 2010). Sequences afﬁliated to the family
Anaerolineaceae were derived from stations 1 to 4. The nearest cul-
tured genus Leptolinea (distance matrix: 84.5% identity with the
nearest Leptolinea member) has been described as saccharolytic,
including pectin and cellulose degrading species (Yamada et al.,
2006; Ishii et al., 2008). In these studies, members of the genus
Leptolinea were not able to reduce sulfate or other sulfur species
(Yamada et al., 2006). Leptolinea and Levilinea species largely com-
prise taxa discovered in anaerobic waste water sludge (Rivière et al.,
2009), indicating the possibility of active heterotrophic processes
at the AOM seep. However, sequences from the Simeulue seep were
closer related to sequences which could not be assigned to these
genera (Figure 6). Three sequences of the stations 1 and 2 were
closely related to the genus Desulfococcus of the family Desulfobac-
teraceae, which is in good agreement with previously described
AOM sites (Knittel and Boetius, 2009).

At the stations 1 and 2 (only data for station 1 are shown in
Figure 4), mcrA genes encoding for the enzyme methyl-CoM-
reductase of the anaerobic methanotrophic ANME-2 group dom-
inated over ANME-1. ANME-1 mcrA genes prevailed only at the
surface of the station 2. The Methanosarcina (“methanogenic”)
type of the mcrA gene was detected throughout the whole seep
area, while it was completely absent in other sediments of the
Sumatra forearc (Schippers et al., 2010). The simultaneous occur-
rence of both, methane production and oxidation in the seep
area, underscores the important role of the methane cycle for this
system. The dsrA gene, an indicator for the presence of sulfate
reducers, was found in slightly higher gene copy numbers at the
station 1–3 (Figure 4).

Catalyzed reporter deposition–ﬂuorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion cell counts, assessing the active community, indicated that
living Bacteria were present with at least two orders of magnitude
more cells than Archaea at the station 2. At the station 1, active
bacterial and archaeal cells were distributed equally. In contrast,

The total cell numbers of 107 to 109 cells cm

results obtained by qPCR, targeting also inactive microorganisms,
indicate a dominance of Bacteria over Archaea by one order of
magnitude.
−3 at the Simeulue
seep were quite similar to those at sites of the Sumatra forearc
basins not inﬂuenced by methane seepage (Schippers et al., 2010).
These are also comparable to cell numbers reported for the arctic,
methane emitting, Haakon Mosby mud volcano, hosting mainly
aerobic methylotrophs (Niemann et al., 2006b). Also the decrease
of cell numbers with sediment depth was similar compared to this
mud volcano. CARD–FISH cell counts, and qPCR measurements
showed the presence of Bacteria and Archaea, but only small num-
bers of Eukarya. This observation is in agreement with previous
marine sediment studies (Schippers and Nerretin, 2006; Schippers
et al., 2010).

METHANOGENESIS AS A CONCOMITANT PROCESS
Another goal of this research was to demonstrate methanogenic
hydrocarbon degradation (Zengler et al., 1999; Head et al., 2003).
From a geological point of view, the Sumatra forearc seems a
promising location for hydrocarbon generation in the deep sub-
surface, a potential source for upward migrating of complex
hydrocarbons. Hence, all stations were screened for such processes.
Hydrocarbon-dependent methanogenesis was observed in micro-
cosms of the Simeulue seep and the Nias basin. After a ﬁrst transfer
of sediment microcosms of ﬁve stations (Table 2), three stations
showed sustained methanogenesis in the presence of higher hydro-
carbons. Only one of these stations was located in the seep area
(station 6), the other two in the Nias basin. The rates estimated
in the initial setups as well as in the ﬁrst transfers, were in the
same range compared to a hydrocarbon adapted community of
contaminated harbor mud in the North Sea (Siegert et al., 2011).
Methanogenesis was absent in microcosms without added sub-
strates. Possibly, the presence of 28 mM sulfate and other electron
acceptors inhibited methanogenesis from TOC, but not from
higher hydrocarbons. In contrast, it seems likely that the addition
of higher hydrocarbons stimulated activity of TOC and hydro-
carbon utilizing microorganisms. Positive controls containing the
substrates TMA or methanol with 28 mM sulfate conﬁrmed that
methanogenic activity in spite of present sulfate. Methanogene-
sis from these substrates evolved rapidly within the ﬁrst weeks of
incubation and was in the same order with the AOM rates.

Desulfobacteraceae species may be indicative for AOM consor-
tia (Knittel and Boetius, 2009), but one member of this family
is the hexadecane degrader Desulfococcus oleovorans strain Hxd3
(Aeckersberg et al., 1991; So et al., 2003). Hence, the occurrence
of this family suggests the presence of consortia capable of anaer-
obic degradation of higher hydrocarbons. The ﬁnding of other
closely related hydrocarbon seep associated sequences, e.g., from
mud volcanoes or contaminated sites, conﬁrmed this (Figure 6).
However, hydrocarbons are abundant substances in nature and
our culturing experiments show that the presence of hydrocar-
bon degraders does not necessarily depend on the presence of
hydrocarbons in higher concentrations. In summary, hydrocarbon
utilizing methanogenic communities were present in the Sumatra
forearc sediments irrespective of methane seepage, and their pres-
ence does not infer that higher hydrocarbons played a signiﬁcant

role in the carbon cycle. Nonetheless, this is the ﬁrst report of stable
microcosms of hydrocarbon-dependent methanogenic microbial
communities from the deep ocean.

CONCLUSION
The ﬁrst-time discovery of an AOM-inﬂuenced methane seep
in the Indian Ocean was conﬁrmed by the presence of dis-
solved methane as well as methane-dependent pro- and eukary-
otic communities. Methane δ13C signatures indicate a microbial
origin of methane. The released methane was oxidized by an
active microbial community, sharing features with other seep

communities. Albeit negligible in situ, it was also observed that
higher hydrocarbons were converted to methane in vitro.
