Microbial methane from coal beds accounts for a signiﬁcant and growing percentage of
natural gas worldwide. Our knowledge of physical and geochemical factors regulating
methanogenesis is still in its infancy. We hypothesized that in these closed systems, trace
elements (as micronutrients) are a limiting factor for methanogenic growth and activity.
Trace elements are essential components of enzymes or cofactors of metabolic pathways
associated with methanogenesis. This study examined the effects of eight trace ele-
ments (iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, boron, and copper) on methane
production, on mcrA transcript levels, and on methanogenic community structure in enrich-
ment cultures obtained from coal bed methane (CBM) well produced water samples from
the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Methane production was shown to be limited both by
a lack of additional trace elements as well as by the addition of an overly concentrated
trace element mixture. Addition of trace elements at concentrations optimized for stan-
dard media enhanced methane production by 37%. After 7 days of incubation, the levels of
mcrA transcripts in enrichment cultures with trace element amendment were much higher
than in cultures without amendment. Transcript levels of mcrA correlated positively with
elevated rates of methane production in supplemented enrichments (R2 = 0.95). Meta-
bolically active methanogens, identiﬁed by clone sequences of mcrA mRNA retrieved
from enrichment cultures, were closely related to Methanobacterium subterraneum and
Methanobacterium formicicum. Enrichment cultures were dominated by M. subterraneum
and had slightly higher predicted methanogenic richness, but less diversity than enrichment
cultures without amendments. These results suggest that varying concentrations of trace
elements in produced water from different subsurface coal wells may cause changing levels
of CBM production and alter the composition of the active methanogenic community.

INTRODUCTION
Coal bed methane (CBM) is a form of natural gas that is trapped
at large quantities in deep unmineable coal bed basins and pro-
duced from boreholes (Thielemann et al., 2004). CBM is held at
coal internal surfaces by the combination of physical sorption and
hydrostatic pressure of subsurface water. Gas extraction is accom-
plished by pumping water from subsurface coal bed basins to the
surface through drilled access wells that end within the coal bed.
As water is pumped to the surface, methane is no longer held by
the hydrostatic pressure in micro pore structures of coal beds and
migrates from the subsurface coal into the water stream ﬂowing
to the well. At the surface, methane is separated from produced
water and extracted to be used as an energy source (Wheaton
and Donato, 2004). Seventy percentage of the world’s CBM pro-
duction is supplied by the United States while the remainder is
produced by Australia, India, Canada, China, United Kingdom,
Columbia, Russia, Ukraine, and Austria primarily from shallow to
deep subsurface coal beds (Flores et al., 2008).

The production of CBM has increased dramatically, and cur-
rently supplies about 10% of the total natural gas produced

annually in the U.S. (Fletcher, 2005; Petzet, 2005). The most active
methane producing coal seams found in the U.S. are located in
Alabama/Mississippi, Southern Colorado/New Mexico, and Mon-
tana/Wyoming (Harris et al., 2008). CBM is produced either via
microbial degradation of organic molecules (i.e., biogenic gas) or
via transformation of organic matter by geochemical processes
(i.e., thermogenic gas; Flores et al., 2008). Coal deposits of the
Powder River Basin (PRB) in Wyoming have emerged as having
some of the most active biogenic gas production, with methane as
the main constituent (85–90%; Flores et al., 2008; Stra˛po´c et al.,
2008). Coal beds in the PRB basin are entirely continental, and
are deposited in fresh water systems with insigniﬁcant concen-
trations of chloride (Van Voast, 2003). The δ13CCO2 values and
associated fractionation factors indicate microbial CO2 reduction
as the overwhelming pathway for methane generation in the PRB
(Flores et al., 2008).

Current knowledge of the indigenous microbiota residing in
coal bed basins, of the role they play in mediating coal biodegra-
dation to methane, and of the biogeochemical and physical factors
that may inﬂuence biological methanogenesis is limited. Jones

Enhanced methanogenesis with trace elements

et al. (2010) recently reported variations in the rates of biogenic
methane production among CBM wells in the Gulf Coast Basin,
Texas. Possible factors causing this interwell variability remain
unknown. Only recently have subsurface microbial communities
been characterized that contribute to methane production from
unmined or abandoned coal beds (Shimizu et al., 2007; Green
et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008; Midgley et al., 2010;
Penner et al., 2010; Beckmann et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2012). Other
studies determined the potential of these microbes to generate
methane (Green et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008;
Ulrich and Bower, 2008), as well as to characterize the metabolic
pathways involved in generating methane in subsurface systems
(Stra˛po´c et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2010).

Methanoculleus was found together with the methylotrophic
genus Methanolobus in groundwater samples from Ishikari coal
ﬁeld, Hokkaido, Japan (Shimizu et al., 2007), and Methanolobus
dominated production water in the Ordos Basin, China (Guo
et al., 2012). Members of Methanosarcina spp., known to use
a wide range of substrates (H2/CO2, acetate, methanol, and
methylamines) were detected in a methanogenic enrichment
from coal beds in Alberta, Canada (Penner et al., 2010). While
hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium ssp. were found in enrich-
ment cultures from the Jharia coal ﬁeld, India (Singh et al., 2012),
and Methanosarcinales (Green et al., 2008), Methanobacteriales,
and Methanococcales (Klein et al., 2008) were discovered in the
PRB, Wyoming. Some studies questioned whether members of the
methanogenic community could be enhanced for methane pro-
duction by manipulating temperature, pH, coal particle surface,
electron acceptors or donors, or rapid release of organic substrates
(Green et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2010; Penner
et al., 2010). However, these attempts involved addition of electron
acceptors or donors that might limit methanogenesis by diverting
electrons away from methanogens, or, in case of enhanced organic
matter release might limit methanogens by the creation of toxic
conditions for methane generation within coal beds (Jones et al.,
2010).

Microbial communities in subsurface coal beds likely feed
on organic and inorganic sources either deposited within the
coal during coaliﬁcation (coal formation process) or those that
have migrated from the surface along groundwater ﬂow paths
(Krumholz et al., 1997; Ulrich and Bower, 2008). Furthermore,
trace elements (e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, copper, zinc,
tungstate, selenium, and boron) are crucial along with macronu-
trients (C, N, P, etc.), for proper growth and metabolism of
microorganisms (Goodwin et al., 1990; Takashima et al., 1990;
Lengeler et al., 1999). Various trace element demands of microor-
ganisms are determined by the enzymes and the proteins needed
for their particular metabolisms such as CO2 assimilation, catab-
olism of organic compounds, and respiration (Zhang and Glady-
shev, 2009). Iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), copper
(Cu), molybdenum (Mo), and tungstate (W) are known as crucial
trace elements for enzymatic activity in the methanogenic system
(Takashima et al., 1990; Zhang and Gladyshev, 2010; Glass and

Orphan, 2012). Requirement and optimal concentrations of trace
elements for diverse microbial metabolisms are commonly stud-
ied with pure cultures only, which are orders of magnitude higher
than in situ concentrations in most natural environments (Glass
and Orphan, 2012). Although, some studies tested the effects of
trace elements on methanogenesis in different anaerobic environ-
ments such as peatlands, maize silage, food industrial waste, and
activated waste water sludge (Burgess et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Gil
et al., 1999; Basiliko and Yavitt, 2001; Feng et al., 2010; Pobeheim
et al., 2010), no studies have investigated whether methanogenesis
in coal bed basins is inﬂuenced by trace elements. Two geochem-
ical investigations of trace element chemistry across the PRB in
Wyoming did not ﬁnd consistent trends of trace element concen-
trations in CBM production waters (McBeth et al., 2003; Jackson
and Reddy, 2007).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of trace ele-
ment amendments on methanogenic activity and diversity in an
enrichment culture from subsurface produced CBM water. This
study was designed in three phases to understand (i) the effect of
varying concentrations of trace element mixtures on methane pro-
duction, (ii) the effect of trace element addition on transcript levels
of the gene mcrA, which encodes the α-subunit of methyl coen-
zyme M reductase, and (iii) the effect of trace element addition on
the community structure of metabolically active methanogens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
FIELD SAMPLING, ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY, AND DNA EXTRACTION OF
CBM PRODUCED WATER
Three separate samples of CBM produced water were collected
from a CBM well that is located within the Wall coal seam for-
mation at a depth of 376 m below surface in the southern PRB,
Wyoming, USA. The water sample was ﬁltered through a series
of 0.45 and 0.22 μm ﬁlters into gas tight Nalgene sample bottles,
and acidiﬁed to pH <2 with 1% nitric acid (Trace metal grade,
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Trace element concen-
trations in ﬁltered water samples were quantiﬁed by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

For the extraction of DNA 200 ml of water sample were drawn
into a sterile 0.22 μm cellulose acetate ﬁlter (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) inside a presterilized 25-mm Swinnex ﬁlter holder, fast
frozen on dry ice, and transported to the laboratory for storage
at −80˚C until further processing. Total DNA was extracted from
the ﬁlters with the PowerWater DNA isolation kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions (MoBio Laboratories, CA, USA).

MICROCOSMS
Microcosms were initiated immediately after sampling from an
actively gas-producing well stream by inoculating CBM produced
water with pea-sized sub-bituminous coal sampled from the PRB.
Ten replicates were set up with 30 ml of produced water and 5 g
of coal in 120 ml anoxic serum vials capped with butyl rubber
stoppers under a headspace of N2/CO2 [80:20 (v/v)] and incu-
bated at 37˚C without agitation. Yeast extract was not added, as
coal is the only organic matter to be used for microbial growth.
A separate set of microcosms was initiated from the same well
stream by inoculating only CBM produced water in basal salt
medium. All microcosms were set up anaerobically (Balch and

Enhanced methanogenesis with trace elements

Wolfe, 1976) in 160 ml of anoxic serum vials capped with butyl
rubber stoppers. Upon arrival at the laboratory, various electron
acceptors were tested and microbial growth and methane pro-
duction were observed in microcosms incubated at 37˚C without
agitation. The electron donor H2 (H2/CO2 (80/20 (v/v)) was
replaced with 50 mM sodium acetate or 5 mM methanol with
N2/CO2 as the headspace gas.

ENRICHMENTS
Long term methanogenic enrichment cultures were established
from CBM produced water by transferring cultures grown on
H2/CO2 [80/20 (v/v)] after 50–80 days of incubation during a
period of 2.5 years. Enrichment cultures were established in 160 ml
serum vials with H2/CO2 [80/20 (v/v)] and basal salt medium
consisting of
the following components; 15 ml of KH2PO4
(27.2 g/l), 15 ml Na2HPO4·2H2O (35.6 g/l), 12.5 ml of a mix-
ture of NH4Cl (24 g/l), MgCl2·6H2O (8 g/l), and NaCl (24 g/l),
and 40 ml of NaHCO3 (100 g/l); 10 ml vitamin solution (Biotin
2.0 mg, Folic acid 2.0 mg, Pyridoxine-HCl 10.0 mg, Thiamine-
HCl·2 H2O 5.0 mg, Riboﬂavin 5.0 mg, Nicotinic acid 5.0 mg,
d-Ca-pantothenate 5.0 mg, p-aminobenzoic acid 5.0 mg, Thioc-
tic acid 5.0 mg/l). To this 1 ml of a well deﬁned trace element
solution (SL-10) was added, that contained (per liter) 1.5 g of

FeCl2·4H2O, 70 mg of ZnCl2, 100 mg of MnCl2·4H2O, 6 mg of
H3BO3, 190 mg of CoCl2·6H2O, 2 mg of CuCl2·2H2O, 24 mg
of NiCl2·6H2O, 36 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 15 mg of Na2WO4,
15 mg of Na2SeO3·5H2O, and 10 ml of 25% HCl (Widdel et
al., 1983). Resazurin (2.0 g/l) was added as a reducing indica-
tor. The medium pH was adjusted to 7.2± 0.2 with dilute HCl.
−1 HCl was added into medium as the
Cysteine at 0.5 mg ml
sole reductant. The commonly used Na2S·9H2O was not pre-

ferred as a reductant to avoid a reaction with metals in the
medium. It was observed that there is no signiﬁcant effect on

methane production without addition of Na2S·9H2O (data not

shown).

TRACE ELEMENT-AMENDED ENRICHMENT CULTURES
In the ﬁrst phase of this study, the effects of varying concentra-
tions of trace elements on methane production were evaluated.
Initially, 10% (v/v) actively growing log-phase enrichment was
incubated in 160 ml of anoxic serum vials capped with butyl
rubber stoppers with fresh medium described in the Section
“Enrichments.” Yeast extract was not added, since it is a source
of trace elements and its element content is unknown. The head-
space of serum bottles was aseptically ﬂushed with H2/CO2 [80/20
(v/v)]. No external electron acceptors were supplied and CO2
was the sole electron acceptor. Increasing concentrations of trace
element mix solutions (1×-TES, 2.5×-TES, and 5×-TES) were
added into enrichment cultures prepared in triplicates. 1×-TES
is the concentration of the SL-10 trace element solution for a
mixture of eight trace elements (iron, nickel, cobalt, molybde-
num, zinc, manganese, boron, and copper), which is given in
detail above. Enrichments and abiotic controls were incubated for
6 weeks under strict anaerobic condition in the dark at 37± 1˚C
without agitation. Glassware utilized in the study was pre-cleaned
and treated with 10% nitric acid over night and baked at 550˚C
for 6 h.

For the second and third phases of this study, 10% (v/v)
actively growing log-phase enrichment was incubated into fresh
medium free of trace elements three times over a period of
four and a half months. The last transfer culture was used as
seed for 1×-TES amended and unamended enrichment cultures.
Medium preparation and incubation conditions were the same as
in phase one. Enrichments were set up in 10 replicates and incu-
bated over 5 weeks. The medium pH was adjusted to 7.2± 0.2
with dilute HCl, and checked every week. Every week two dupli-
cate incubations were sacriﬁced for RNA isolation and total cell
counting.

TOTAL CELL ENUMERATION WITH DAPI STAINING
(cid:2)
Total cell numbers were estimated with 4
, 6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) nucleic acid staining (Becerra et al., 2009)
in 1×-TES amended and unamended enrichment cultures and in
CBM produced water samples. A sequence of 40 randomly chosen
microscopic ﬁelds across each slide was examined under 1000×
oil-immersion magniﬁcation using an epiﬂuorescence microscope
(Nikon Eclipse E400) equipped with a Hamamatsu digital camera
to determine the average number of cells in the samples.

DETECTION OF METHANE PRODUCTION
Methane accumulation in the headspace was monitored and quan-
tiﬁed for all microcosms and enrichments by gas chromatography
using a GC-17A (Shimadzu, Co., Kyoto) equipped with an Equity-
1 column (30 m× 0.53 mm ID, 3.0 μm, Supelco, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and a ﬂame ionization detector with helium as the car-
rier gas. The injector and column temperatures were adjusted to
100˚C and the detector was held at 125˚C. Certiﬁcated standard
CH4 (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used for calibra-
tion. Methane concentration in the headspace was calculated by
comparing peak areas of sample and standard.

EXTRACTION OF TOTAL RNA AND mRNA
Total RNA was extracted from 1×-TES amended and unamended
enrichment cultures at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days using the method
described by Chin et al. (2008) with some modiﬁcations. The
complete procedure was performed at 2˚C or on ice. A volume
of 2.0 ml of enrichment culture was anaerobically removed from
a serum bottle and transferred to 2.0 ml RNase-free screw-cap
tubes. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 min and supernatant was
decanted. Approximately 0.6 g of 0.1 mm diameter glass beads,
0.6 ml TPM buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 1.7% polyvinylpyrrolidon,

20 mM MgCl2·6H2O, in DEPC-treated water) and 2 μl yeast tRNA

(mRNA carrier) were added to the cell pellet. The tubes were
shaken upside down for 10 min, followed by ballistic cell destruc-
tion for 1 min at 4200 rpm using a mini-bead beater (BioSpec
Products; Bartlesville, OK, USA). Cell debris and glass beads were
concentrated by centrifugation for 3 min. The supernatant was
transferred to a tube containing 1 μl RNase inhibitor (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA). The pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml phenol-
saturated lysis buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mM EDTA, 1%
(w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (Ambion), and 6% water-saturated
phenol. After an additional round of bead beating at the same
conditions, the tubes were exposed to centrifugation for 5 min
and the supernatant was pooled with the supernatant of the ﬁrst

Enhanced methanogenesis with trace elements

round of bead-beating. A volume of 0.6 ml phenol (pH 4.3) was
added to the pooled supernatant, the tubes were vortexed for 40 s
and exposed to centrifugation for 5 min. The supernatant was
extracted with phenol–chloroform–isoamylalcohol [pH 7.8–8.2;
25:24:1 (v/v)] and chloroform–isoamylalcohol [24:1 (v/v)]. The
aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh 2 ml tube containing
1/10th volume of 3 M NaAc (pH 5.2) and 2 μl of linear acry-
lamide (5 mg/ml; Ambion), and ﬁlled with 100% cold ethanol up
to a ﬁnal volume of 2 ml. The tubes were invert mixed and con-
tents concentrated by centrifugation for 30 min. The pellets were
washed with 0.5 ml 70% cold ethanol, invert mixed, and again
centrifuged for 10 min. The pellet was dried in a desiccator for
5 min and resuspended in water. RNA was treated with RNase free-
DNase (Ambion) to remove DNA contamination. DNase treated
RNA was further puriﬁed by precipitating with 1/10th volume 3 M
NaAc (pH 5.2), and 4 volumes of cold ethanol followed by cen-
trifugation for 20 min. The pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml
70% cold ethanol, dried, and resuspended in water. Enrichment
of mRNA was performed with DNase treated and puriﬁed RNA
using the MICROB Express puriﬁcation system (Ambion). DNA
contamination was checked with agarose gel electrophoresis fol-
lowing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
by performing control experiments in which no reverse transcrip-
tase was added to the isolated RNA before the PCR step. RNA
concentration was determined by absorption at 260 nm with a
Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Puriﬁed RNA
was stored at -80˚C.

REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
The cDNA of mRNA for the gene mcrA was generated with
the primer mcrA-rev, (Steinberg and Regan, 2008) with 0.5 μg
mRNA as the template. Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase™ (250
U; Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The conditions used in the cDNA synthesis program
were as follows: initial incubation at 25˚C for 10 min, incuba-
tion at 37˚C for 120 min, enzyme inactivation at 85˚C for 5 s,
followed by rapid cooling to 4˚C. cDNA samples were stored at
−20˚C until use. Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the
essential and unique enzyme for methane production. It cat-
alyzes the ﬁnal step of methanogenesis, which reduces a methyl
group linked to coenzyme M to methane (Ellerman et al., 1988).
Because this enzyme is found in all known methanogens and
is absent from non-methanogenic Archaea and Bacteria (Chis-
toserdova et al., 1998; Thauer, 1998; Bapteste et al., 2005), the
mcrA gene is used as a speciﬁc functional marker to detect
methanogens (Weil et al., 1988; Hallam et al., 2003). Previ-
ous studies have suggested that the phylogeny of mcrA fol-
lows the 16S rRNA phylogeny within various environments, and
thus has been used as an alternative phylogenetic tool to detect
and identify methanogens (Springer et al., 1995; Lueders et al.,
2001; Luton et al., 2002; Friedrich, 2005). The MCR operons
are found in two forms; MCRI (mcrBDCGA) which encodes
mcrA and MCRII (mrtBDGA or mrtBGA) which encodes mrtA.
Although, MCRI exists in all methanogens, MCRII is only found
in members of the orders Methanobacteriales and Methanococ-
cales (Lehmacher and Klenk, 1994; Bult et al., 1996; Reeve et al.,
1997).

CLONING, SEQUENCING, AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
Extracted genomic DNA was used as template for PCR ampliﬁca-
tion of 16S rRNA genes using archaea-speciﬁc primers ARC21F
(DeLong, 1992) and 1492R (Lane, 1991). PCR cycles were as
follows: 1 cycle at 94˚C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94˚C for 1 min,
58˚C for 1.5 min and 72˚C for 2 min, and a ﬁnal extension step
at 72˚C for 10 min. In addition, three mRNAs clone libraries
were generated from mcrA-speciﬁc RT-PCR amplicons (491 bp
length ampliﬁed with primers mlas and mcrA-rev; Steinberg and
Regan, 2008) obtained from trace element amended (TES-T1)
and unamended enrichment cultures (NO-TES) after 7 days of
incubation, and from startup enrichment cultures designated as
time zero (T0). The puriﬁed RT-PCR amplicons from enrich-
ment cultures and Archaeal 16S rRNA genes from produced water
were ligated into the pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Promega) and trans-
formed into Escherichia coli JM109. Positive clones were veriﬁed
by PCR ampliﬁcation with vector speciﬁc primers M13F and
M13R according to the protocol supplied by manufacturer. Clones
were randomly selected, and plasmid inserts were sequenced with
the M13F primer by Sanger sequencing. Sequences were checked
manually and edited for ambiguous bases using the software Chro-
mas sequence viewer (Technelysium, Tewantin, Australia), and
multiple sequence alignments were created using ClustalX v.1.83
(Thompson et al., 1997). Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were
assigned to an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) using the soft-
ware package DOTUR based on ≥97% similarity (Schloss and
Handelsman, 2005). Phylogenetic and taxonomic analyses were
conducted using a representative sequence from each OTU. Phy-
logenetic trees based on the mcrA amino acid sequence were
constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method (Saitou and Nei,
1987) with the “percentage of acceptance mutations distance cor-
rection model (PAM)”provided by the software package MEGA4.1
(Kumar et al., 2008).

To estimate the conﬁdence of tree topology, bootstrap resam-
pling analysis for 1000 replicates was performed with the
Neighbor-Joining method. After sequences were assigned to OTUs,
the frequency data at species level were used to construct rarefac-
tion curves and to calculate diversity and richness indices using
DOTUR. Estimates of phylotype richness were calculated accord-
ing to the Chao1 estimator that takes into account the number
of different OTUs in a sample, and the abundance-based cover-
age estimate (ACE). Species richness and evenness were calculated
using the Shannon diversity index (H SHANNON) and the Simpson’s
index (H SIMPSON), which takes into account the level of phylotype
dominance.

REAL-TIME PCR QUANTIFICATION
Dilution series of puriﬁed mcrA RT-PCR amplicons were used
as calibration standards for the real-time PCR quantiﬁcation.
The puriﬁed RT-PCR products were quantiﬁed and prepared
for serial dilution as described previously (Chin et al., 2004b).
The detection limits were determined from two independent
measurements with dilution series of puriﬁed RT-PCR products
(standards) in real-time PCR (108–101 target molecules per reac-
tion). The copy numbers of unknown samples were calculated
after real-time ampliﬁcation from the linear regression of the
standard curve. The cDNA generated with mcrA gene-speciﬁc

primers was quantiﬁed with real-time quantitative PCR using
SYBR Green. The levels of mcrA transcripts (per μg mRNA)
were determined in enrichment cultures for which methane pro-
duction was measured in parallel. All reactions were carried out
in 20 μl reaction volume containing 0.02 units of iProof High
Fidelity polymerase (BioRad), buffer, 2.5 pmol of each dNTP,
bovine serum albumin, and 20 pmol of each primer of the pair
mlas-mcrArev (Steinberg and Regan, 2008). The temperature pro-
ﬁle was composed of an initial incubation at 98˚C for 1 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 98˚C for 10 s, 58˚C annealing for 10 s,
65˚C extension for 32 s, and a ﬁnal extension at 65˚C for 6 min.
Dissociation curve analysis to detect the presence of primer dimers
and non-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation peaks was performed after the
ﬁnal extension. The size of the PCR products was checked with
agarose gel electrophoresis, and the speciﬁcity of PCR products
was veriﬁed by sequence analysis of the clone library. Quantitative
analysis of the cDNA was carried out with the 7500 Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) using
7500 Real-Time PCR System Sequence Detection software (v
1.3.1). The precision as well as the reproducibility of quantiﬁca-
tion were carefully optimized, and PCR products were checked
for their correct lengths as described previously (Chin et al.,
2004b).

NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE ACCESSION NUMBERS
The sequences for mcrA mRNA clones and for archaeal 16S rRNA
gene clones generated in this study were deposited in the Gen-
Bank database under the following accession numbers: JQ917180
to JQ917194 for all mcrA sequences, and JQ917195 to JQ917203
for archaeal 16S rRNA sequences.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA

(Systat Software, 2004).

RESULTS
CBM PRODUCED WATER CHARACTERIZATION
In situ conditions at well depth indicated a pH value of 6.7
and a temperature of 29.6˚C. Physicochemical analysis of the
CBM produced water included: dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
13.161 mm/kg; F, 0.68 mM; Cl, 0.31 mM; SO4, 0.07 mM; Na,
6.24 mM; Mg, 0.12 mM; K, 0.13 mM; Ca, 0.26 mM; Ba, 0.365 mM;
total cations at 7.11 mM, and total anions at 6.65 mM. Trace ele-
ment concentrations (μg/l) were B, 32.05; Al, 0.100; V, 0.49; Mn,
6.84; Fe, 14.92; Co, 0.03; Ni, 0.76; Cu, 0.48; Zn, 21.61; As, 0.07;
Mo, 0.62; Ag, 0.07; Ba, 329.100; Tl, 0.01; Pb, 0.02; and U, 0.01.
The concentrations of trace elements in 1×-TES, which was the
concentration of trace elements in the SL-10 solution, was far
greater than in situ concentrations except for boron, which was
at a lower concentration in trace element enrichment cultures
(21.3 μg/l). The calculated concentrations of elements in 1×-TES
enrichment cultures were 785 times more in Fe, 132 times more
in Ni, four orders magnitude more in Co, 476 times more Mo, 73
times more Mn, 28 times more Zn and 31 times more Cu than
in situ concentrations.

METHANOGENIC POTENTIAL AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF
METHANOGENS IN CBM PRODUCED WATER
Total cell number in the CBM produced water sample was deter-
mined at 3.2× 105 by DAPI staining, which is within midrange
of cell numbers observed in other deep aquifers (Pedersen, 1993).
Signiﬁcant amounts of methane were produced in microcosms
inoculated with pie-size coals (9.2± 0.6 μmol/ml) after 6 months
of incubation. This indicates that the methanogenic community
had the ability to degrade coal into methane.

Since coal is potentially the source of trace elements (Jackson
and Reddy, 2007), we did not use coal as a carbon source to test the
effects of trace elements on methanogenesis. For controlled and
reproducible conditions, the CBM produced water sample was
supplemented with a methanogen speciﬁc medium and amended
with electron acceptors such as acetate, methanol, or CO2. After
5 months of incubation, methane production was detected only in
microcosms with H2/CO2 (80/20 v/v) at the cumulative amount of
7.7 μmol/ml, and subsequent enrichments were continued based
on this set of cultures.

An archaeal 16S RNA gene clone library was constructed to
identify the methanogens in the CBM produced water sample.
Nine OTUs were identiﬁed within the 67 clonal sequences based
on a “cut-off ” value of ≥97% nucleotide sequence identity. The
archaeal community was dominated by the genus Methanobac-
terium sp. (60%) with 40% identiﬁed as uncultured archaea
(Table 1). A total of 25 sequences were afﬁliated with Methanobac-
terium sp. GH (96–99% similarity) which was previously isolated
from sediments of the Gahai Lake in China (Zhu et al., 2011). Fif-
teen sequences were afﬁliated with Methanobacterium sp. SA-12
(97%) found in a subsurface gold mine (unpublished data, Gen-
Bank accession number AY695843.1) and to an uncultured clone
(97%) from a minerotrophic fen (Cadillo-Quiroz et al., 2008). Five
clones were afﬁliated with an uncultured archaeon clone (93%)
from a gas hydrate production research well, Canada (unpublished
data); four clones were afﬁliated (92–97%) with clones obtained
from the deep aquifer of gold mines, South Africa (Takai et al.,
2001); 10 clones were afﬁliated (96%) with clones from deep sub-
surface sediments in the Paciﬁc (Biddle et al., 2006; Zhang et al.,
2010); and eight clones were afﬁliated with a clone (91%) from
hydrothermal sediments in Japan (Nunoura et al., 2010).

EFFECT OF INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF TRACE ELEMENTS ON
METHANE PRODUCTION
The effect of increasing concentrations of trace elements (1×-TES,
2.5×-TES, and 5×-TES) on methane production in CBM pro-
duced water enrichments was tested weekly for a total duration
of 42 days. The differences in the average values of cumulative
methane production among the enrichment cultures amended
with 1× and 2.5× trace element concentrations were statisti-
cally signiﬁcant (P < 0.001), when compared with unamended
enrichment cultures. At the end of the incubation period, the level
of methane production was signiﬁcantly lower (8.52 μmol/ml)
in enrichment cultures without addition of
trace elements
than in enrichment cultures with addition of trace elements
(11.7 μmol/ml; Figure 1A). This suggests that methanogenic
activity became diminished under trace element limitation. It
was also observed that there was a signiﬁcant negative effect on

6 weeks it reached the highest level (10.70 μmol ml
Table 2), which might be the result of adaptation over time of
the methanogenic community to higher amounts of trace element
concentrations.
Direct cell counts were obtained over 35 days to document cell
growth in 1×-TES amended and unamended cultures (Figure 1B).
Amended and unamended studies were started with the addi-
tion of 2.3× 107 and 2.5× 107 cells/ml, respectively. At the end
of the incubation time, cell densities had increased to 9.61× 108
and to 4.26× 108, respectively. Total cell numbers were ∼125%
higher in trace element amended than in unamended enrichment
cultures after 5 weeks of incubation. Since these are mixed cultures,
growth trends were not well resolved for lag, log, and station-
ary phases (Meyer-Dombard et al., 2012). Calculated generation
times were ∼70 h during the ﬁrst 168 h (day 7) for amended and
unamended cultures. After 7–14 days, the generation times for
amended cultures were ∼80 h and two times longer (∼159 h) for
unamended cultures. Total cell numbers increased steadily during

values were observed in all incubations, but there was no signif-
icant difference between enrichment cultures during the entire
incubation time (Figure 1B).

QUANTIFYING mcr A TRANSCRIPTS
The levels of mcrA transcripts in 1×-TES amended and una-
mended enrichments were quantiﬁed in weekly time inter-
vals using quantitative RT-PCR over 35 days of
incubation.
After 1 week, a quicker and stronger response was observed for
mcrA transcript levels in amended enrichments compared to
unamended enrichments. At this time point, the addition of
trace elements enhanced mcrA transcript levels to its maximum
(2.18× 107 copy numbers/μg mRNA), while the level of mcrA
transcripts remained much lower in enrichment cultures without
addition of trace elements (7.03× 106 copy numbers/μg mRNA).
Unamended cultures reached their maximum levels at 14 days
of incubation (1.3× 107), but it was still lower than amended
enrichment cultures after 7 days of incubation (Figure 2). After
35 days of incubation, mcrA transcript numbers were relatively
low, with 3.05× 104 and 1.05× 104 for amended and unamended
enrichment cultures, respectively.

The increased levels of mcrA transcripts in response to trace ele-
ment addition correlated positively with elevated rates of methane
production (R2 = 0.95), while a very weak correlation was deter-
mined in unamended cultures (R2 = 0.69; Figure 3). Addition-
ally, the rate of methane production in unamended enrichments
was lower than in amended enrichments, which correlates with
mcrA transcript levels over the ﬁrst 7 days of incubation (Table 2;
Figure 2).

TRACE ELEMENT EFFECT ON METHANOGENIC COMMUNITY
STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY
Enrichments incubated for 1 week were chosen to construct
clone libraries based on their highest methane production
−1) and paralleled by highest mcrA
rates (2.57 μmol ml
transcript levels (2.18× 107 copy numbers/μg mRNA) as a proxy
of highest methanogenic activity over 6 weeks of incubation
(Table 2; Figure 2). Three clone libraries of RT-PCR ampli-
cons of mcrA mRNA were constructed to compare the metabol-
ically active methanogenic taxa in 1×-TES amended (designated
T1:TES) and unamended (T1:No TES) enrichment cultures after
1 week of incubation, and in startup enrichment cultures (des-
ignated T0). Eighty-one unique sequences were clustered into
individual phylotypes (OTUs) to calculate rarefaction and non-
parametric estimators (Table 3). Methanobacterium formicicum-
and Methanobacterium subterraneum-like sequences were detected
in startup, amended, and unamended enrichment cultures.

Both richness and diversity of the methanogenic commu-
nity changed during 7 days of incubation. Enrichment cultures
with addition of trace elements had a slightly higher predicted

methanogen richness and diversity than enrichment cultures
without the addition of trace elements (Table 3).

The effects of trace elements on the relative abundance and
distribution of methanogens were monitored. Addition of trace
elements contributed speciﬁcally to the enhancement of M.
subterraneum-like sequences over M. formicicum-like sequences
(Figure 4). Amended and unamended enrichments were dom-
inated by clones that grouped closely with the mcrA genes of
M. subterraneum-like sequences (81.5% in amended enrichments
and 46.2% in unamended enrichments) and M. formicicum-like
sequences (18.5% in amended enrichments and 53.8% in una-
mended enrichments). The methanogenic community compo-
sition in the starting enrichment culture (T0) appeared to be
unchanged during 1 week of incubation, and mcrA genes from
M. subterraneum-like sequences comprised 46.2% and M. formici-
cum-like sequences 53.8% of the clone library, representing similar
ratios between both taxa in enrichment cultures without addition
of trace elements (Figure 4).

enrichments with and without addition of trace elements did not
reach asymptotes (Figure 5). Non-parametric statistical analy-
ses (Table 3) showed that the observed richness covered between
100, 86, and 100% of the estimated total methanogenic richness
in startup enrichment, trace element amended and unamended
enrichment cultures, respectively.

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES OF METHANOGENS
A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of the genes
mcrA was constructed using a selection of sequences from cul-
tured methanogens and environmental clones from the public
database GenBank. Several clones from T1:TES, T1:No TES, and

T0 clone libraries were found to be closely related (95–99%) with
two sequences identiﬁed in subsurface shale environments (Gen-
Bank accession numbers EF117654, EF117630). Clone TES-3 was
the most dominant clone in amended enrichments, representing
20 out of 27 clones. It exhibited 97% sequence identity with M.
subterraneum which is the nearest isolated relative. Clone No-15
represented 11 of 26 clones and clustered most closely with M. sub-
terraneum with 98% similarity. Only one clone from T1:TES and
three clones from T1:No TES were closely related to unpublished
clone rlm_673a (97%) which was identiﬁed in an anaerobic waste
water digester (GenBank accession number JF460370.1). As many
as 14 and 12 out of 26 clones in T0 clone libraries have 91 and

DISCUSSION
This study has enhanced our understanding of trace element
effects on methane production, and on the activity and diver-
sity of methanogens in enrichments of water produced from a
CBM well. In the present study, we showed that addition of an
optimized concentration of trace elements elevated methane pro-
duction over 37% and increased total cell number by 125%. By
comparing enrichment cultures with and without trace element
amendments (Fe, Ni, Co, Mo, Co, Zn, B, Mn), we have found
not only a correlation between increasing mcrA levels and ele-
vated methane production, but have also demonstrated a shift
in the metabolically active methanogenic community from a M.
formicicum-like group to a M. subterraneum-like group.

TRACE ELEMENT AS A LIMITING FACTOR IN SUBSURFACE COAL BED
METHANE WELLS
Microbial methane production in deep coal bed basins indicates
the ability to sustain microbial life in these limiting environmen-
tal conditions (dark, anoxic, reduced, limited substrate replen-
ishment, etc.). The associated physical, chemical, and biological
restrictions may inﬂuence activity, function, and diversity of the

microbial species in the anaerobic biodegradation of organic mat-
ter in coal. It is suggested that distribution and activity of the
microbial communities are supported by water–coal interaction in
subsurface environments (Green et al., 2008). The organic fraction
(e.g., carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) and the inor-
ganic constituents of coal (e.g., trace elements) support growth in
this subsurface biosphere, and the geochemical potential deter-
mines the energy proﬁle for microbial growth, maintenance, and
survival under dormancy. Coal–water interactions are expected
to provide trace elements for microorganisms (Finkelman, 1995).
Yet, our water chemical analysis from the coal bed well in the PRB
demonstrated that the amount of trace elements concentrations
at this habitat was far lower than the concentrations required for
optimum methanogenesis (Figure 1A).

Biodegradation of coal organic deposits into methane is limited
to anoxic and reduced conditions, and by the interaction of at least
four metabolically diverse groups of microorganisms, hydrolytic,
fermentative, acetogenic, and methanogens (Wawrik et al., 2012).
Although the rate-limiting step for coal biodegradation is the ini-
tial solubilization of a macromolecular, polycyclic, lignin-derived
aromatic network into utilizable substrates by microorganisms
(Fakoussa and Hofrichter, 1999), we argued that methanogenesis
would be another limiting step in coal biodegradation to methane,
if the amount of trace elements is limited. Methanogens are the

terminal oxidizers in anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter
and they are vital for the resultant production of methane (Stra˛po´c
et al., 2008). This study provides the novel consideration that
the availability of optimized trace element concentrations might
have an inﬂuence on methanogenic community structures and on
methanogenesis.

Trace elements in coal bed basins may be concentrated in three
different ways: (1) concentration during the life of plants prior
to coaliﬁcation; (2) concentration during the decay of organic
substances; and (3) concentration by aqueous solution after burial
of plant materials (Goldschmidt, 1935). Trace element concen-
tration should be unique in each coal bed deposit, since the
composition of plant material and the water source for each coal
bed basin can vary with the geological formation, surrounding
geochemical conditions, and adjacent overlying mudstones, silt-
stones, and sandstones. This geological material might be the
source of trace elements, which leach with the groundwater into
coal bed basins. Furthermore, the source of CBM produced waters
might be water accumulated during coal formations or derived
from meteoric waters (Flores et al., 2008). Since coal has trace ele-
ments embedded within its structure at varying concentrations,
we avoided to add coal to incubations to prevent uncontrolled
trace element effects.

METHANE PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF ADDED
TRACE ELEMENTS
Optimal concentrations of trace elements exist for cellular activ-
ity, and concentrations beyond this optimum can have a toxic
effect on cells (Swaine and Goodarzi, 1995). The results of this
study demonstrated that an optimized concentration of trace
elements added to the enrichment cultures from coal bed pro-
duced water is beneﬁcial for methanogenic growth and activity.
Some recent studies suggested that the addition of high amounts
of trace elements leads to a decrease in methanogenic activity
in environmental applications (Chakraborty et al., 2010; Pobe-
heim et al., 2010). Our results indicate that the lack of added
trace elements (No-TES) to enrichment cultures limited methane
production in a way similar to adding high concentrations of trace
elements (2.5×-TES, and 5×-TES; Figure 1A).

EFFECT OF METHANOGENIC COMMUNITY SHIFT ON METHANOGENIC
ACTIVITY
In addition, the results from this study demonstrated that addi-
tion of trace elements to production water enrichments inﬂuenced
methanogenic community structure (Table 3). This suggests that
trace elements in coal bed basins may be an important factor
inﬂuencing the methanogenic community structure in coal bed
basins in situ. It also indicates that M. subterraneum-like group
has a growth advantage over M. formicicum-like group in the
applied concentration of trace elements after 7 days of incubation
(Figure 4).

Trace elements, utilized by microorganisms, provide proteins
with unique coordination, catalytic, and electron transfer proper-
ties. Shi et al. (2005) reported that almost one fourth of structurally
characterized proteins required a coordinated metal atom. Cobalt
(Co), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), molybdenum (Mo), and/or
tungsten (W) are known to be crucial for the activity of enzymes in

methanogens (Takashima et al., 1990). The concentration and type
of trace elements required for metabolism and growth may vary
among different species of microorganisms (Basiliko and Yavitt,
2001). Burgess et al. (1999) reported that trace metals inﬂuence
microbial waste degradation and species diversity within sewage
sludge. Gough and Stahl (2010) have shown that individual micro-
bial populations are selected by exposition to varying levels of
metals in different regions of an anoxic freshwater lake. Chin et
al. (2004) reported that structural changes in the methanogenic
community lead to functional changes in methane production in
rice ﬁelds.

The active microbial community can be represented by RNA
rather than DNA analysis (Lloyd et al., 2010), and previous studies
suggested a correlation between metabolic activity and the tran-
script level of key genes (Fleming et al., 1993; Nazaret et al., 1994;
Chin et al., 2008). In fact, transcripts for mcrA can be employed
to demonstrate that methanogens are metabolically active in the
environment (Juottonen et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2011). The results
from this study suggest that addition of trace elements caused the
methanogenic community shift in composition, and a range of
mcrA transcript levels could be directly associated with a rate of
methane production and thus with the activity of methanogens
(Figure 3).

In this study, mcrA genes of M. formicicum and M. subterra-
neum, and the gene mrtA of M. formicicum were identiﬁed from
both trace elements amended and unamended enrichment cul-
tures (Figure 6). Since there is a high degree of DNA sequence
conservation between mcrA and mrtA sequences (Luton et al.,
2002), primers designed for detection of mcrA sequences also
detect mrtA sequences. Since the gene mrtA has arisen by lateral
transfer from the Methanococcales rather than gene duplication
(Reeve et al., 1997), they form a distinct cluster on the phylo-
genetic tree closer to Methanococcales than Methanobacteriales
mcrA sequences (Luton et al., 2002).

METHANOBACTERIUM SSP. IN SUBSURFACE COAL BEDS IN THE PRB
Molecular analyses and cultivation studies demonstrated that
methanogens are one of the most abundant groups in subsur-
face environments such as petroleum reservoirs, faults, and marine
sediments (Orphan et al., 2000; Shlimon et al., 2004; Moser et al.,
2005). So far, very few methanogenic species were isolated from
these environments (Kotelnikova et al., 1998; Lai and Wu, 2011). In
this study, both results, the phylogenetic analysis of archaea and the
methane production in microcosms with H2/CO2, supported that
methane production dominantly occurs via the hydrogenotrophic
pathway in the sampled coal bed well. Our result was supported
Klein et al. (2008) who found Methanobacterium sp. in CBM pro-
duced water and also associated with coal samples from PRB,
Wyoming. Furthermore, many other studies also reported ﬁnd-
ings of Methanobacteriales in a variety of deep subsurface coal
basins such as the Jhari Gippsland basin, Australia (Midgley et al.,
2010), Alberta coal beds of Canada (Penner et al., 2010), and
coal ﬁelds located at Parbatpur in India (Singh et al., 2012).
After ∼2.5 years of routine transfers of CBM produced water into
methanogenic media, the enrichments were highly dominated
by two species of Methanobacterium sp., which are M. subterra-
neum and M. formicicum. It is important to note that enrichment

Enhanced methanogenesis with trace elements

cultures successfully represented the majority of methanogens in
the CBM produced water sample (Table 1). M. subterraneum was
isolated from deep subterranean granitic aquifers, and its pheno-
typic and phylogenetic characteristics were described previously
(Kotelnikova et al., 1998). M. formicicum was isolated from a
domestic sewage sludge digest (Bryant and Boone, 1987) and in
a municipal land ﬁeld sample as an endosymbiont of a ciliate
(Finlay and Fenchel, 1991). H2/CO2 and formate are the growth
substrates for these two species but they cannot grow on methy-
lamines, acetate, pyruvate, dimethyl sulﬁde, methanol, or other
alcohols plus carbon dioxide. Growth of M. subterraneum strain
A08 is inhibited by yeast extract (Kotelnikova et al., 1998). In the
present study, H2/CO2, acetate, and methanol were each tested
as growth substrate for microcosms, and H2/CO2 was found to
be main carbon and energy source. Additionally, yeast extract,
which was used in the initial enrichment culture, was not added
to the trace element amended enrichments due to the unknown
quantities of trace elements in it. Optimum temperature con-
ditions for M. subterraneum strain A08 and M. formicicum are
described as 20–40˚C and 37–45˚C, respectively. Optimum pH
values for M. subterraneum strain A08 and M. formicicum are
between pH 6.6–6.8 and pH 7.8–8.8, respectively (Kotelnikova
et al., 1998). In this study, the pH value in enrichments was
adjusted to 7.2± 0.2 and no differences were observed during
7 days of incubation at 37˚C between trace element amended
and non-amended enrichments. Among all growth factors in the
enrichments such as temperature, pH, or added substrates, trace
element addition was the only variable that could have an effect
on methanogenesis.

There are still many unknowns regarding the effect of trace
elements, due to their bioavailability and optimal concentration

on facilitated methanogenesis, and their toxic concentrations for
microbial growth and activity in coal bed basins in situ. Bioavail-
ability and toxicity of trace elements in the environment is under
the control of geochemical processes such as mineral dissolu-
tion, precipitation, and ion adsorption/desorption. In this study,
highly enriched methanogenic cultures were used to investigate
the effect of trace elements on methanogenesis. However, in the
natural environment, abundance and concentration of trace ele-
ments might enhance the rate of carbon source degradation by
methanogens either directly or in a more indirect way. For exam-
ple, it might increase the speciﬁc metabolic activity of bacterial
groups such as primary or secondary fermenters whose prod-
ucts are the substrates for methanogens. Further study should
focus on effects of trace elements on bacterial activity in coal
biodegradation pathways and their associated community com-
positions. Effects of individual trace elements on growth and
activity of methanogens and on fermenters might provide fur-
ther insights to enhance biogenic methane production in coal bed
wells. Therefore, better understanding of trace elements as a lim-
iting factor for methanogenic activity in a coal bed basin will have
a broader impact on our knowledge about ecology and physiology
of methanogens.
