The basal ganglia, a group of nuclei, are associated with a variety of functions, including motor control. The striatum, which is the 
ma jor input station of the basal ganglia in the brain, is regulated in part by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. The stria tum is 
made up 96% of medium spiny neurons which are GABAergic cells. GABAergic cells are known to contain DA receptors which 
divide into two main branches- the D1 receptor (D1R)-expressing direct pathway and the D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing indirect 
pathway. The role of these two efferent pathways has not been clear in control of motor behaviors. To establish the influence of the 
different DA subtypes on GABAergic systems in the striatum, D1 selective receptor agonist (SKF 38393) and D2 selective receptor 
agonist (Quinpirole) were administered to mice. SKF 38393 and quinpirole were administered intraperitoneally in a volume of 0, 1, 
5, 10 (mg/kg) and motor activity was assessed for 60 min immediately after the injection of DA agonists. Mice were sacrificed after 
behavioral test and the striatum in the brain were dissected for analysis of GABA level with HPLC. Both SKF 38393 and quinpirole 
dose-dependently increased locomotor activity but, GABA level in the striatum was clearly different in two agonists. These findings 
provide insight into the selective contributions of the direct and indirect pathways to striatal GABAergic motor behaviors.

INTRODUCTION

The basal ganglia, a group of nuclei, are associated with a variety 
of functions, including movement, reward, and motivational 
processes (Percheron et al., 1994; Mink, 1996; DeLong and 
Wichmann, 2007). The striatum, which is the major input 
station of the basal ganglia in the brain, is regulated in part by 
dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra and projects to

the output nuclei of the basal ganglia via two pathways that work 
together to modulate behavior (Mink, 1996; Hikosaka et al., 2000). 
The striatum is made up 96% of medium spiny neurons which 
are GABAergic cells (Yelnik et al., 1991). The GABAergic cells 
have DA receptors which divide into two main branches- the D1 
receptor (D1R)-expressing direct pathway and the D2 receptor 
(D2R)-expressing indirect pathway (Bateup et al., 2010). The direct 
pathway projects to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and 
the indirect pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPe) 
and the STN (Gerfen et al., 1990). Patients with Parkinson’s disease 
(PD) which is severe movement disorder show the loss of striatal 
dopamine and rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine 
pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a

model of PD (Steg and Johnels, 1993; Redgrave et al., 2010). Thus, 
the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway in the basal ganglia is im-
por tant for motor control and classical models of proposed two 
efferent pathways have not been clear in part of GABAergic striatal 
motor behavior. Here, we have explored whether GABAergic cells 
in the striatum are affected by specific excitation of D1 and D2 
dopamine receptor subtypes and modulate locomotor activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Male C57BL/6J male mice 7 weeks of age were obtained from the 
Orient Co. (Kyungki-Do, Korea), and they were housed for 1 week 
under a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle in a temperature-controlled and 
humidity-controlled room. All animal care and testing conditions 
were in accordance with the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee) in College of Medicine, the Catholic Uni ver-
sity of Korea.

SKF 38393 and quinpirole treatment
Hydrochloride salts of SKF 38393 and quinpirole (LY 171555) 
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All drug 
doses were calculated as the free base and the drugs were dissolved 
in 0.9% saline vehicle. All the mice were received intraperitoneally.

Behavioral measurements
The locomotor activity was measured in a rectangular container 
(40×40×45 cm) that was equipped with a video camera above the 
centre of the floor as described previously (Chae et al., 2004). The 
walls and floor were made of clear plastic and they were painted 
with white. The locomotor activity was monitored by a video-
trac king system using the SMART program (PanLab, Barcelona, 
Spain). Mice were allowed to adapt themselves for 1 h in the con-
tainer and the distance they travelled was recorded every 10 min 
throughout a 1-h baseline and for 1 h after treatment. Loco motor 
activity was measured in cm.

Sample collections and GABA measurements
At the end of behavioral measurements, the striatums were di-
ssected from the mice and all samples were frozen at −70 °C. GABA 
analysis was done using high performance liquid chro matography 
(HPLC). The mobile phase consisted of 40% acetonitrile in 20 mM 
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5 with glacial acetic acid) with a flow 
rate of 0.7 mL/min. Samples underwent pre-column deri va ti zation 
with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPT), and were detected with a fluo-
rescence detector (excitation 350 nm, emission 450 nm). Area was 
used to calculate results from a standard curve, with an internal 

stan dard (commercial γ-amino butyric acid). 

Statistical analysis
The experimental results are expressed as means±s.e. The be ha-
vi oral data were analyzed using the SPSS program (Version 13.0). 
Sta tistical differences among groups were analyzed by one-way 
analy sis of variance followed by the Tukey’s post-hoc and LSD 
tech nique. p<0.05 was considered to be significant.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The present study explored whether locomotor activity and 
GABAergic cells in the striatum are affected by specific excitation 
of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor subtypes. 
There was a dose-dependently (0, 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg ) significant 
increase in the locomotor activity of the mice after treatment with 
SKF 38393 or quinpirole as seen in Fig. 1. Significant increases 
in activity were observed 10 min after injection of SKF 38393. 
The higher dose (SKF 38393 10 mg/kg) significantly increased 
activity at every time-point sampled over the 1hr test period 
[F(3,19) =18.307, p<0.001]. SKF 38393 is a synthetic compound

which acts as a selective D1/D5 receptor partial agonist. Most 
of pre vious studies have reported that dopamine D1 receptor 
agonists are stimulating locomotor activity (Bruhwyler et al., 1991; 
Mazurski and Beninger, 1991). We observed a significant increase 
in locomotor activity of the mice injected with the dopamine D1 
receptor agonist,SKF 38393, compared to control injected with 
vehicle. The results confirm previous studies indicating that D1 
agonist predominantly increase locomotor activity (Molloy and 
Waddington, 1985 and 1987; Mazurski and Beninger, 1991). 
Also, dopamine D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, significantly 
increases locomotor activity at 20 min after injecting quinpirole 
in dose dependent manner [F(3,17) =14.48, p<0.001]. But, the 
role of dopamine D2 receptors in the locomotor activity of adult 
animals is ambiguous. For example, administration of quinpirole 
led to dose-dependent (0.05~1.0 mg/kg) increase of locomotion 
consistent with the present result (Brown et al., 2002; Stuchik 
et al., 2007). However, in other studies, the effects of quinpirole 
in rodents have been shown to depend on dose and time after 
injection. At lower doses (0.1 mg/kg), decreases in activity are 
observed (Horvitz et al., 2001; Schindler et al., 2002) and at higher 
doses (0.5-10 mg/kg), increases in activity can be seen at 60 min 
after injection (Hor vitz et al., 2001). The doses in the current 
study were in high range and activity was measured immediately 
following injection. Although biphasic pattern of quinpirole on 
locomotor inhibition followed by excitation is not unclear, the 
results confirm that higher doses of D2 receptor agonist increase 
locomotor activity. 
GABA levels in the striatum were clearly different in two ago-
nists. GABA level induced by SKF 38393 was increased in the stria-
tum [F(3,16)=11.827, p<0.001] (Fig. 2) and GABA level indu ced 
by quin pirole was decreased [F(3,16)=2.05, p=0.15] (Fig. 3). Thus, 
do pa mine D1 receptor agonist appeared to exert increase in 
GABA release and dopamine D2 receptor agonist appeared to

inhibit GABA release in the striatum. The study of Harsing and 
Zigmond (1997) demonstrated that the overflow of GABA evoked 
by electrical field stimulation (8 Hz) was increased two-fold by 
SKF-38393 (10 microM), and electrically evoked GABA overflow 
was reduced 50% by quinpirole (10 microM) in the stria tum. Thus, 
our results support previous studies indicating that dopamine 
agonist can exert an excitatory influence on GABA rel ea se via 
D1 receptor and an inhibitory influence on GABA release via D2 
receptor within the striatum. The striatum, which is the major 
input station of the basal ganglia in the brain, is regulated in part 
by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. The striatum 
is made up 96% of medium spiny neurons which are GABAergic 
cells (Yelnik et al., 1991). Reduced dopamine innervation of the 
striatum results in hypokinesia and difficulty in initiating different 
motor patterns and enhanced striatal dopamine activity give rise 
to hyperkinesia (Blair, 2003; Grillner et al., 2005). These results 
provide inkling that the striatum has a important role in the 
selection of motor behavior (Grillner et al., 2005). The GABAergic 
cells have DA receptors which divide into two main branches- the 
D1 receptor (D1R)-expressing direct pathway and the D2 receptor 
(D2R)-expressing indirect pathway (Bateup et al., 2010). The direct 
pathway projects to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and 
the indirect pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPe) 
and the STN (Gerfen et al., 1990). The striatal medium spiny 
output neurons are inhibitory (GABAergic). Striatal neurons are 
activated by dopaminergic innervations via D1 type receptors, 
it provides strong inhibition to the SNpr and thereby disinhibits 
thalamic neurons in a motor center which are responsible for 
releasing locomotor. In the indirect pathway from the striatum via 
the GPe and the STN, striatal neurons activated by dopaminergic 
innervations via D2 type receptors inhibit thalamus’ neurons in a 
motor center that affect motor behavior (DeLong and Wichmann,

2007). Actually, most of previous experiments have reported that 
do pamine D1 receptor agonists are stimulating locomotor acti-
vi ty (Bruhwyler et al., 1991; Mazurski and Beninger, 1991), how-
ever, the role of dopamine D2 receptors in the locomotor acti vity 
is am biguous (Horvitz et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2002; Schindler 
et al., 2002; Stuchik et al., 2007). Thus, this behavioral hypo-
thesis is needed to be further investigated. Parkinsonism resulted 
from the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine is a movement disorder 
charac terized by tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, and postural 
instability (Gerfen et al., 1990; DeLong and Wichmann, 2007). 
The study on PD has been greatly facilitated in the 1-methyl4-
phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of 
the disease by using metabolic imaging and electrophysiological 
studies. The MPTP model has suggested that neuronal discharge 
is increased in the STN, GPi, and SNr but decreased in the GPe, 
thus resulting in excessive inhibition of components of the motor 
circuit in the thalamus, cortex, and brainstem. These aspects of 
the model are generally supported by lesioning and inactivation 
studies, which have shown that inactivation of the STN or GPi 
increases the metabolic activity in cortical motor areas and 
improves bradykinesia and tremor in patients with PD. However, 
lesions of the thalamus do not lead to significant bradykinesia 
or akinesia, and lesions of the GPi do not result in dyskinesias 
(DeLong and Wichmann, 2007). Although this issue is complex 
and still unsettled, nigrostriatal GABAergic pathway in the basal 
ganglia is important for motor control. Both SKF 38393 and 
quinpirole dose-dependently increased locomotor activity but, 
GABA level in the striatum was clearly different in two agonists. 
Our results provide insight into the selective control of the direct 
and indirect pathways to striatal GABAergic motor behaviors. 
Specific GABAergic motor control of the direct and indirect 
pathways in the basal ganglia requires further investigations which 
will contribute to therapeutic understanding of motor function 
disorders.
