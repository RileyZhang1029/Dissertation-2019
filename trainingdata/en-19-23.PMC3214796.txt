ABSTRACT

Oxidative  damage  is  thought  to  be  a  major  cause  of  the  progression  of  dopamine 
(DA)rgic  neurodegeneration  as  in  Parkinson’s  disease.  We  have  previously  reported 
that  tetrahydrobiopterin  (BH4),  an  endogenous  molecule  required  for  DA  synthesis, 
exerts  oxidative  stress  to  DA-producing  cells  and  facilitates  the  production  of  DA 
quinone.  It  is  known  that  aconitase,  present  in  both  mitochondrial  and  cytosolic  forms, 
act  as  an  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  sensor,  and  that  their  inactivation  leads  to 
further  generation  of  ROS.  In  the  present  study  we  investigated  whether  the  BH4- 
associated  vulnerability  of  DA  cells  might  involve  aconitase.  In  DArgic  cell  line  CATH.a, 
BH4  treatment  caused  reduction  of  activity  of  both  mitochondrial  and  cytosolic  aco-
nitases,  and  this  appeared  to  be  due  to  direct  inactivation  of  the  pre-existing  enzyme 
molecules.  Although  most  of  the  activity  reduced  by  BH4  was  increased  upon  re-
activation  reaction  under  a  reducing  condition,  the  restoration  was  not  complete, 
suggesting  that  irreversible  and  covalent  modification  has  occurred.  The  aconitase 
inactivation  was  exacerbated  in  the  presence  of  DA  and  attenuated  in  the  presence  of 
tyrosine  hydroxylase  inhibitor  a-methyl-p-tyrosine,  suggesting  the  involvement  of  DA. 
The  degree  of  inactivation  increased  when  the  cells  were  treated  with  the  quinone 
reductase  inhibitor  dicoumarol  and  decreased  in  the  presence  of  quinone  reductase 
inducer  sulforaphane.  Taken  together,  BH4  appeared  to  lead  to  both  reversible  and 
irreversible  inactivation  of  aconitase  and  that  this  is  facilitated  by  the  presence  of  DA 
and  accumulation  of  DA  quinone.

dative  stress 
to  play  a  major  role. 
Overwhelming  evidence,  particularly  in  post-mortem 
studies  of  human  PD  brain,  indicates  that  oxidative 
damage  evoked  by  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS) 
participates  in  the  progression  of  DArgic  neurode-
generation.
    We  have  previously  demonstrated  that  tetrahydro-
bioperin  (BH4),  an  endogenous  molecule  required 
for  DA  synthesis,  exerts  oxidative  stress  to  DA- 
producing  cells  (Choi  et  al.,  2000;  2003;  Lee  et  al., 

24 Nam  Soo  Yoon,  et  al.

l988) 

l973;  Davis  et  al., 

2007).  BH4  undergoes  oxidation  during  the  hyd-
roxylation  reaction  (Davis  and  Kaufman,  1993)  as 
well  as  nonenzymatic  auto-oxidation  (Fisher  and 
Kaufman, 
to  produce 
hydrogen  peroxide  and  superoxide  radical.  BH4 
thus  facilitates  the  oxidation  of  DA,  producing  DA 
quinone.  Unless  the  quinone  is  removed  by  the 
enzyme  quinone  reductase,  oxygen  radicals  are 
further  formed  during  its  redox  cycling.  As  such,  DA 
quinone  is  thought  to  cause  mitochondrial  dysfunc-
tion  including  disruption  of  membrane  potential  (Lee 
et  al.,  2002)  and  increased  mitochondrial  swelling 
(Berman  and  Hastings,  1999).  In  addition,  DA  quin-
one  is  thought  to  mediate  α-synuclein-associated 
neurotoxicity  in  PD  by  covalently  modifying  α- 
synuclein  monomer  (Dunnett  and  Bjorklund,  1999) 
and  by  stabilizing  the  toxic  protofibrillar  α-synuclein 
(Conway  et  al.,  2001).
    The  enzyme  aconitase,  an  enzyme  in  the  Krebs 
cycle,  is  known  to  be  a  sensitive  index  of  oxidative 
stress.  As  a  sulfur/iron  protein, 
is 
reversibly  inactivated,  resulting  in  slowing  down  of 
the  Kreb’s  cycle.  In  addition,  studies  have  demon-
strated  that  the  inactivation  of  mitochondrial  aconit-
ase  results  in  generation  of  hydrogen  peroxide  and 
free  iron  (Flint  et  al.,1993;  Vasquez-Vivar  et  al., 
2000;  Cantu  et  al.,  2009).  The 
iron  can 
mediate  Fenton  reaction,  which  in  turn  catalyzes 
further  generation  of  intracellular  ROS.
    Based  on  this  background  information,  it  was 
possible  to  hypothesize  that  BH4  may  lead  to 
inactivation  of  mitochondrial  aconitase  and  that  this 
further  contributes  to  the  generation  of  ROS  and 
cell  death.  We  show  in  the  present  study  that 
exposure  to  BH4  leads  to  both  reversible  and 
irreversible  inactivation  of  aconitase  and  that  this  is 
facilitated  by  the  presence  of  DA  and  accumulation 
of  DA  quinone.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Materials

    All  culture  media, 
fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS), 
horse  serum,  L-glutamine,  trypsin/EDTA,  and  pen-
icillin-streptomycin  were  from  GibcoBRL  (Gaither-
sburg,  MD,  USA).  BH4,  sulforaphane,  dicoumarol, 
isocitrate,  α-methyl-p-tyrosine  and  ferrous  ammonium 
sulfate  were  purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical  (St. 

Louis,  MO,  USA).  All  other  chemicals  were  reagent 
grade  and  were  from  Sigma  or  Merck  (Rahway,  NJ, 
USA).

Cell  culture

    CATH.a  cells  were  grown  in  RPMI  1640  suppl-
emented  with  8%  horse  serum  and  4%  FBS.  Cells 
were  grown  as  monolayers  in  the  presence  of  100 
IU/l  penicillin  and  10μg/ml  streptomycin  at  37oC  in 
5%  CO2  in  humidified  atmosphere.  For  experiments, 
the  cells  were  plated  on  polystyrene  tissue  culture 
dishes  at  a  density  of  1.5∼2×105  cells/well  in  24 
well  culture  plates  or  3×106  cells/60  mm  plate.  After 
24  h,  the  cells  were  fed  with  fresh  medium  and 
treated  with  BH4  and/or  other  drugs.

Aconitase  enzyme  assay

    Cells  were  lysed  in  ice-cold  lysis  buffer  containing 
0.6  mM  MnCl2,  1  mM  L-cysteine,  1  mM  citrate,  and 
0.5%  Triton-X  100  in  50  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  7.4).  The 
aconitase  activity  was  measured  spectrophotometr-
ically  by  monitoring  the  formation  of  cis-aconitate 
from  isocitrate  at  240  nm  in  50  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH 
7.4)  containing  0.6  mM  MnCl2  and  20  mM  isocitrate 
at  25oC  (Gardner  and  Fridovich,  1992).  Reactivation 
of  aconitase  was  performed  by  incubating  the  cell 
lysate  for  30  min  in  the  presence  of  50  mM 
dithiothreitol,  200μM  Na2S,  and  200μM  ferrous 
ammonium  sulfate  in  50  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  8.0)  at 
37oC.

Mitochondrial  fractionation

    Mitochondrial  fraction  was  prepared  as  described 
by  Menzies  et  al.  (2002).  Cells  grown  on  100  mm 
culture  dish  were  harvested  and  washed  in  pho-
sphate  buffered  saline  (PBS),  homogenized  on  ice 
in  10  volume  of  250  mM  sucrose  with  0.1  mM 
EGTA  and  2  mM  HEPES,  pH  7.4,  using  a  glass- 
Teflon  homogenizer,  and  the  homogenates  were 
centrifuged  at  900×g  for  6  min  at  4oC.  Mitochondrial 
pellet  and  cytosolic 
fraction  were  obtained  by 
centrifugation  of  the  supernatant  at  16,000×g  for  10 
min.

Data  analyses

    Comparisons  were  made  using  ANOVA  and  New-
man-Keuls  multiple  comparisons  test.  p＜0.05  was 
considered  statistically  significant  for  all  analyses.

RESULTS

BH4  leads  to  inactivation  of  aconitase

    We  first  tested  whether  exposure  of  DArgic  cells 
to  BH4  might  cause  reduction  of  aconitase  activity. 
CATH.a  cells,  the  cell  line  extensively  used  to 
investigate  DArgic  cell  death  as  an  in  vitro  PD 
model,  was  treated  with  100μM  BH4,  as  this  con-
centration  was  previously  determined  to  exert  pref-
erential  toxicity  to  DArgic  cells  (Choi  et  al.,  2000; 
2003).  As  shown  in  Fig.  1A,  the  exposure  to  BH4 

indeed  resulted  in  a  decrease  in  cellular  aconitase 
activity:  A  reduction  to  81%  was  obtained  within  3 
h,  which  was  further  decreased  to  24  h.  The  red-
uction  was  already  evident  at  a  concentration  as 
low  as  10μM  (Fig.  1B).  Since  the  exposure  of  cells 
to  BH4  might  have  also  caused  a  change  in  the 
amount  of  aconitase  protein  as  well  as  inactivation 
of  the  pre-existing  aconitase,  we  sought  to  examine 
the  direct  effect  of  BH4  on  aconitase  by  subjecting 
lysate  of  untreated  CATH.a  cells  to  BH4.  The  res-
ults  showed  that  this  exerted  a  more  immediate  and

activity  was  determined  in  the  lysate  of  CATH.a  cells  exposed  to 
(A)  100μM  BH4  for  various  durations;  (B)  various  concentrations 
of  BH4  for  3  h;  and  in  the  cell  lysate  that  had  been  coincubated 
with  (C)  100μM  BH4  for  various  durations  and  (D)  various 
concentrations  of  BH4  for  30  min.  (E)  Aconitase  enzyme  activity 
was  also  determined  in  the  cytosolic  and  mitochondrial  fractions 
of  CATH.a  cells  that  had  been  treated  with  100μM  BH4  for  3 
and  24  h.  Data  are  expressed  as  the  mean±SEM  in  percentage

dramatic  effect.  At  100μM  BH4,  the  aconitase 
activity  was  reduced  immediately  within  15  min  to 
7.7%  of  untreated  control  (Fig.  1C).  A  significant 
decrease  was  also  observed  at  10μM  BH4  (Fig. 
1D).  Therefore,  it  appeared  that  the  activity  of  the 
existing  enzyme,  rather  than  a  change  in  gene 
expression,  is  involved  in  the  BH4-  induced  red-
uction  of  aconitase  activity.  Because  aconitase  is 
present 
the  mit-
ochondria,  we  asked  whether  one  form  might  be 
affected  more  than  the  other.  For  this,  we  frac-
tionated  the  lysate  of  cells  that  had  been  exposed 
to  BH4  into  mitochondrial  and  cytosolic  fractions 
and  subjected  each  to  aconitase  activity  assay.  As 
shown  in  Fig.  1E,  the  activity  of  both  forms  was 
equally  decreased  by  BH4.

The  inactivation  is  partially  irreversible

    It  has  been  reported  that  aconitase  acts  as  a 
ROS  sensor  and  that  its  inactivation  by  ROS  is 
reversible.  Therefore,  we  tested  whether  the  activity 
reduced  by  the  BH4  exposure  might  be  restored  by 
reactivation.  For  this,  the  lysate  of  cells  treated  with 
BH4  for  24  h  was  exposed  to  dithiothreitol,  Na2S 
and  ferrous  ammonium  sulfate.  The  results  showed 
that  the  enzyme  activity  was  recovered  to  87%  of 
untreated  control,  from  66%  before  the  reactivation 
(Fig.  2).  About  34%  of  the  activity  reduced  by  the 

BH4  treatment  could  not  be  recovered,  indicating 
that  the  BH4-induced  inactivation  was  only  partially 
reversible.  This  suggested  that  irreversible  covalent 
modification  might  also  have  occurred.

DA  is  involved  in  the  aconitase  inactivation

    We  have  previously  observed  that  DA  makes 
cells  vulnerable,  and  that  this  is  because  in  the 
presence  of  BH4,  DA  is  readily  oxidized  to  DA 
quinone.  We  therefore  tested  whether  the  addition 
of  DA  may  exacerbate  the  effect  of  BH4  on  aco-
nitase.  Cells  were  coincubated  with  100μM  DA  and 
100μM  BH4,  and  the  degree  of  inactivation  was 
compared  with  that  of  cells  treated  with  BH4  alone. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  3,  DA  further  lowered  the  aco-
nitase  activity  from  66%  to  45%,  suggesting  that 
DA  amplified  the  inactivation.  For  further  confirm-
ation,  we  depleted  the  DA  content  in  the  cell  with 
100μM  α-methyl-  p-tyrosine,  the  inhibitor  of  tyros-
ine  hydroxylase,  before  exposing  the  cells  to  BH4. 
In  this  case,  the  aconitase  inactivation  was  not  as 
(88%  of  untreated  control).  Taken 
dramatic 
together, 
the  presence  of  DA 
in  DArgic  cells 
appeared  to  contribute  to  inactivation  of  aconitase.

Fig.  2.  Aconitase  inactivation  by  BH4  is  partially  irreversible.  The 
lysate  of  CATH.a  cells  that  had  been  exposed  to  100μM  BH4 
for  24  h  was  obtained  and  incubated  in  reactivation  solution. 
Aconitase  enzyme  activity  was  measured  and  expressed  as  the 
mean±SEM  in  percentage  of  control.

treated  with  100μM  BH4  for  24  h  in  the  presence  of  dopamine 
(100μM)  or  after  a  24  h-pretreatment  with  100μM  α-methyl- 
p-tyrosine.  Aconitase  enzyme  activity  was  measured  in  the  cell 
lysate  and  expressed  as  the  mean±SEM  in  percentage  of  con-
trol;  *p＜0.05,  **p＜0.01  vs.  untreated  control:  ＋p＜0.05,  ＋＋p＜

that  BH4, 

is  also  known  as 

(Longo  et  al.,  2000),  and  superoxide  dismutase-2 
mutant  mouse  model  of  amyotropic  lateral  sclerosis 
(Melov  et  al.,  1999;  Liang  and  Patel,  2004),  as  well 
as  in  aging  (Yan  et  al.,  1997).  We  demonstrate  in 
the  present  study 
the  endogenous 
molecule  that  leads  to  DArgic  cell  demise  (Choi  et 
al.,  2000;  2003),  also  causes  a  decrease 
in 
aconitase  activity.
    The  mitochondrial  aconitase  catalyzes  the  re-
versible  isomerization  of  citrate  and  isocitrate  via  its 
intermediate  form,  cis-aconitate,  in  the  Kreb’s  cycle. 
The  cytosolic  aconitase 
iron 
regulatory  protein  1,  and  acts  as  a  transcription 
factor  binding  to  iron-responsive  elements,  thereby 
inducing  transcripts  of  genes  involved  in  iron  me-
tabolism  and/or  energy  metabolism  (Rouault,  2006). 
We  observed  in  the  current  study  that  both  aconit-
ases  are  inactivated  after  cellular  exposure  to  BH4. 
As  BH4  is  known  to  facilitate  production  of  super-
oxide  radical  (Fisher  and  Kaufman,  1973;  Davis  et 
al.,  1988;  Davis  and  Kaufman,  1993)  and  the  iron- 
sulfur  center  of  aconitases  is  susceptible  to  in-
activation  by  superoxide  radical  (Gardner  and  Frid-
ovich,  1992;  Hausladen  and  Fridovich,  1994;  Li  et 
al.,  2001),  it  is  likely  that  the  inactivation  of  acon-
itases  by  BH4  involves  superoxide  radical.
    We  also  observed  that  the  inactivation  is  only 
partially  reversible.  The  aconitases  are  thought  to 
act  as  an  ROS  sensor,  inactivated  in  the  presence 
of  ROS  but  reactivated  under  normal  condition. 
Therefore,  the  activity  not  recovered  by  the  reactiv-
ation  reaction  would  be  due  to  irreversible  inactiv-
ation.  Indeed  we  have  noted  a  shift  in  mobility  of 
aconitase  upon  2D  gel  electrophoresis,  suggesting 
a  covalent  modification  (data  not  shown).  In  DArgic 
neurons,  DA  can  be  auto-oxidized  to  form  reactive 
quinone  species  capable  of  covalently  modifying 
and  damaging  cellular  macromolecules  (Hastings  et 
al.,  1996).  An  elevated  level  of  auto-oxidation  prod-
ucts  of  cytoplasmic  DA  in  the  Parkinsonian  sub-
stantia  nigra  has  been  noted  (Fornstedt  et  al., 
1989;  Spencer  et  al.,  1998).  That  aconitase  is 
irreversibly  inactivated  by  DA  quinone  is  supported 
by  the  finding  that  induction  of  quinone  reductase 
prevented  aconitase  inactivation  and  inhibition  of 
quinone  reductase  amplified  the  inactivation.
    The  irreversibly  inactivated  aconitase  may  trigger 
a  vicious  cycle  of  producing  hydrogen  peroxide  and 

Fig.  4.  DA  quinone  is  involved  in  the  aconitase  inactivation. 
Cells  were  treated  with  100μM  BH4  for  24  h  after  a  24  h- 
pretreatment  with  2.5μM  sulforaphane  or  in  the  presence  of 
dicoumarol  (10μM).  Aconitase  enzyme  activity  was  measured  in 
the  cell  lysate  and  expressed  as  the  mean±SEM  in  percentage 
of  control;  *p＜0.05,  **p＜0.01  vs.  untreated  control:  ＋p＜0.05, 
＋＋p＜0.01  vs.  BH4-treated.

DA  quinone  is  involved  in  the  aconitase  in-
activation

    Because  the  oxidation  of  DA  to  DA  quinone  is 
thought  to  potentiate  generation  of  ROS  in  DArgic 
cells,  we  tested  whether  removal  of  DA  quinone 
might  attenuate  the  inactivation.  For  this,  the  cells 
were  pretreated  with  sulforaphane,  the  compound 
known  to  elevate  gene  expression  of  quinone  red-
uctase,  at  conditions  previously  shown  to  induce 
quinone  reductase  in  CATH.a  cells  (Han  et  al., 
2007).  Under  this  condition,  the  degree  of  inactiv-
ation  was  smaller  (85%  of  untreated  control;  Fig.  4). 
We  also  tested  whether  inhibition  of  quinone  reduct-
ase  might  have  a  worsening  effect.  Cotreatment  of 
cells  with  the  quinone  reductase  inhibitor  dicoumarol 
(10μM)  resulted  in  further  inactivation  compared 
to  treatment  with  BH4  alone  (45%  of  untreated 
control).

DISCUSSION

    A  role  of  aconitase  inactivation  in  neurodegener-
ative  diseases  has  been  suggested.  Decreased 
aconitase  activity  is  observed  in  various  animal  and 
cell  models  of  neurodegeration  including  the  MPTP 
model  of  PD  (Liang  and  Patel,  2004),  the  DJ-1 
mutant  mouse  model  of  PD  (Andres-Mateos  et  al., 
2007),  the  β-amyloid  model  of  Alzheimer’s  disease

free  iron,  which  would  in  turn  contribute  to  further 
generation  of  DA  quinone  in  DArgic  cells.  In  addit-
ion,  the  inactivation  of  aconitase  would  interfere 
with  the  Kreb’s  cycle  and  thus  the  normal  product-
ion  of  ATP  and  NADH.  Therefore, 
irreversible 
inactivation  of  aconitase  would  ultimately  lead  to 
ATP  depletion  and  cell  death.
    In  summary,  we  show  in  the  present  study  that  in 
DArgic  cells,  oxidative  stress  leads  to  inactivation  of 
the  mitochondrial  and  cytosolic  aconitases  and  that 
this 
formation  of  both  ROS  and  DA 
quinone.  The  role  of  DA  quinone  in  covalent  and 
irreversible  modification  of  aconitase 
in  DArgic 
neurons  may  be  a  factor  that  renders  these  cells 
particularly  vulnerable.
