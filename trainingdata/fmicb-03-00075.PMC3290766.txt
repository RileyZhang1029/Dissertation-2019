Morbilliviruses, which include measles virus (MeV), canine distemper virus, and rinder-
pest virus, are among the most important pathogens in their respective hosts and cause
severe syndromes. Morbilliviruses are enveloped viruses with two envelope proteins, one
of which is hemagglutinin (H) protein, which plays a role in binding to cellular receptors. Dur-
ing morbillivirus infection, the virus initially targets lymphoid cells and replicates efﬁciently
in the lymph nodes. The principal cellular receptor for morbillivirus is signaling lymphocyte
activation molecule (SLAM, also called CD150), which is exclusively expressed on immune
cells. This feature reﬂects the strong lymphoid cell tropism and viral spread in the infected
body. Morbillivirus infection, however, affects various tissues in the body, including the
lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium, and brain. Thus, other receptors
for morbilliviruses in addition to SLAM might exist. Recently, nectin-4 has been identiﬁed
as a novel epithelial cell receptor for MeV. The expression of nectin-4 is localized to polar-
ized epithelial cells, and this localization supports the notion of cell tropism since MeV also
grows well in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Although two major receptors for
lymphoid and epithelial cells in natural infection have been identiﬁed, morbillivirus can still
infect many other types of cells with low infectivity, suggesting the existence of inefﬁcient
but ubiquitously expressed receptors. We have identiﬁed other molecules that are impli-
cated in morbillivirus infection of SLAM-negative cells by alternative mechanisms. These
ﬁndings indicate that morbillivirus utilizes multiple pathways for establishment of infection.
These studies will advance our understanding of morbillivirus tropism and pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Morbilliviruses belong to the order Mononegavirales, family
Paramyxoviridae, and include measles virus (MeV), rinderpest
virus (RPV), and canine distemper virus (CDV). Morbilliviruses
are highly contagious for their respective hosts and mediate simi-
lar consequences of pathogenesis, such as fever, cough and coryza,
and respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. In particular, induc-
tion of severe transient immunosuppression along with the gain of
life-long immunity are the most notable features of morbillivirus
infection (Grifﬁn, 2007).

Measles virus is a leading cause of mortality in children world-
wide. In particular, strong immunosuppression causes secondary
infection and leads to high childhood mortality in the developing
world. RPV affects several species of wild and domestic cloven-
hoofed animals. The mortality rate can reach nearly 100% in highly
susceptible cattle or buffalo herds; in fact, rinderpest had caused
signiﬁcant economic damage since records began. CDV is a cause
of fatal disease in many species of carnivores. Recently, fatal CDV
infection has been reported in other species such as large felids
(Appel et al., 1994), javelinas (Appel et al., 1991), and freshwater
and marine seals (Visser et al., 1990).

To limit these severe and fatal diseases of morbilliviruses, appro-
priate measures have been taken, including live attenuated and
effective vaccines, which were developed more than 40 years ago

and control the viruses well. In particular, international cam-
paigns have been conducted to eradicate both MeV and RPV
globally. As a result of vaccination efforts and culling of infected
animals, eradication of rinderpest in all 198 countries and terri-
tories was declared by OIE (2011) and FAO (2011). Rinderpest
became the second viral disease, after smallpox, to be eradicated
through human efforts. In the case of measles, vaccination has
contributed to reducing the mortality rate in infants, and deaths
due to measles were reduced by 78% worldwide between 2000
and 2008 (from 733,000 to 164,000) after a global campaign for
vaccination (WHO, 2011).

Morbilliviruses are enveloped virions that contain a non-
segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome that encodes a sin-
gle envelope-associated matrix protein (M), two glycoproteins
(hemagglutinin H and fusion protein F), two RNA-polymerase-
associated proteins (phosphoprotein P and large protein L), and
a nucleocapsid protein (N) that encapsulates the viral RNA
(Figure 1). The H gene encodes a key protein for morbillivirus
and its animal hosts: the virus uses this protein to attach to cell
receptors during the ﬁrst step of infection (Grifﬁn, 2007).

The search for the receptor for morbillivirus began in vaccine
strains of MeV, and subsequently identiﬁed receptors for wild-type
strains have revealed the closely related receptor usage and unique
pathogenicity of the viruses.

virus proteins after infection with the Edmonston strain of MeV
and that polyclonal antisera against CD46 inhibited virus binding
and infection.

CD46 is a cell-surface, type I transmembrane 57–67 kD gly-
coprotein that belongs to the family of complement activation
regulators and is ubiquitously expressed in all nucleated human
cells. The most important function of CD46 is as an inhibitor of
complement activation. It protects host cells from complement
deposition by functioning as a cofactor for the factor-I-mediated
proteolytic inactivation of C3b and C4b (Liszewski et al., 1991).
In addition, CD46 has been implicated in the modulation of
T-cell functions (Marie et al., 2002), generation of regulatory
T-cells (Kemper et al., 2003), and control of interferon (IFN)
production (Katayama et al., 2000). CD46 is also important dur-
ing fertilization – it presumably promotes sperm–egg interaction
(Riley-Vargas et al., 2004, 2005; Harris et al., 2006).

CD46 exists in multiple isoforms, which are generated by alter-
native splicing of a single gene. It has four short consensus repeats
(SCR 1–4) comprising 60–64 aa each, an alternatively spliced
serine/threonine/proline-rich region, a transmembrane region,
and an alternatively spliced cytoplasmic tail.

Previous studies have located the MeV binding site on CD46
to the SCR1 and SCR2 domains of the receptor (Buchholz et al.,
1997; Hsu et al., 1997; Casasnovas et al., 1999; Christiansen et al.,
2000; Figure 2). Functional studies in vitro have suggested that
signaling via CD46 is an important component of MeV pathogen-
esis. For example, the high degree of interaction between MeV-H
and CD46 results in downregulation of CD46 from the surface
of infected cells, rendering them more sensitive to C3b-mediated
complement lysis (Schneider-Schaulies et al., 1995a,b; Schnorr
et al., 1995). Interestingly, CD46-mediated immunosuppression
in MeV infection has been reported. One mechanism involves
inhibiting activation-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-12,
which is essential for the generation of successful effector T-cell
responses, by cross-linking CD46 on the surface of monocytes
by MeV (Karp et al., 1996; Galbraith et al., 1998; Karp, 1999;
Kurita-Taniguchi et al., 2000). Interaction of MeV-H and CD46
also induces IL-10, leading to inhibition of the contact hypersen-
sitivity reaction (Marie et al., 2002). In contrast, MeV binding
to CD46 induces IFN production, which further triggers the early
antiviral immune response (Manchester et al., 2000; Naniche et al.,
2000).

Amino acid residues interacting with CD46 in the H protein
have been identiﬁed (F431, V451, Y481, P486, and I487; Masse
et al., 2002; Santiago et al., 2002; Vongpunsawad et al., 2004).
Among them, two amino acid residues (V451 and Y481) are crucial
for determining the ability of MeV strains to cause hemadsorption,
cell fusion, and CD46 downregulation.

ATTENUATION OF MeV PATHOGENICITY BY PASSAGE WITH
VERO CELLS
Although many studies clariﬁed the interaction between MeV-
H and CD46 and the resultant cellular signaling events in vitro,
it had also been revealed that these laboratory strains of MeV
do not induce any typical symptoms in non-human primate
species, which are susceptible to wild-type MeV. For example,
rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have been described to cause

FIGURE 1 | Schematic diagram of the components of the morbillivirus.
The viral particle contains the ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of the
nucleocapsid (genomic RNA and N proteins) and viral RNA polymerase (P
and L proteins), and the envelope consisting of the M, F, H proteins, and
host cell-derived membrane.

In this review, we introduce the identiﬁed receptors for morbil-
liviruses, mainly MeV, and discuss cell tropism and pathogenicity
in terms of receptor usage.

CD46
Measles virus was ﬁrst isolated by Enders and Peebles (1954)
from primary human kidney cells inoculated with the blood and
throat washings of a child with measles. The virus strain (Edmon-
ston) was passaged multiple times in primary human kidney and
amnion cells and then adapted to eggs and multiply passaged in
chick embryo cells to produce the original Edmonston B vac-
cine, which was licensed in 1963 (Grifﬁn, 2007). Administration
of the live attenuated vaccine results in transient immunosuppres-
sion, but induces both expression of the neutralizing antibody and
cellular immune responses sufﬁcient for protection.

Vero cells derived from the African green monkey kidney had
been utilized to isolate MeV as a standard cell line because it
is beneﬁcial and safe. About 40 years after MeV was isolated,
two groups reported in 1993 that CD46 acts as a cellular recep-
tor for laboratory-adapted strains of MeV. Naniche et al. (1992)
obtained a monoclonal antibody that inhibited cell fusion induced
by recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the H and F proteins of the
Halle strain of MeV. The antibody precipitated a cell-surface glyco-
protein from human and simian cells but not from murine cells.
N-terminal amino acid sequencing identiﬁed that the glycopro-
tein was human membrane cofactor protein (CD46), a member of
the regulators of the complement activation gene cluster (Naniche
et al., 1993). Transfection of non-permissive murine cells with a
CD46 expression vector conﬁrmed that the human CD46 mole-
cule serves as a MeV receptor, allowing virus–cell binding, fusion,
and viral replication. Dorig et al. (1993) showed independently
that hamster cell lines expressing CD46 produced syncytia and

Morbillivirus receptors

However, strains isolated in B95a cells or human B-cell lines
were shown to grow only in a limited number of lymphoid cell
lines (Kobune et al., 1990; Schneider-Schaulies et al., 1995b; Tat-
suo et al., 2000a). Furthermore, the H protein of MeV isolated
from B-cell lines neither induced downregulation of CD46 nor
caused cell–cell fusion (upon coexpression of the F protein) in
CD46-positive cell lines (Lecouturier et al., 1996; Bartz et al., 1998;
Tanaka et al., 1998).

From these observations, it had been postulated that B-cell
line-isolated strains do not use the ubiquitously expressed CD46
but utilize another molecule as a receptor (Lecouturier et al., 1996;
Buckland and Wild, 1997; Bartz et al., 1998; Hsu et al., 1998; Tanaka
et al., 1998; Tatsuo et al., 2000a).

SIGNALING LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION MOLECULE
Tatsuo et al. (2000b) performed a screening of a cDNA library
of B95a cells, in which a non-susceptible human kidney cell line,
293T, was transfected with the cDNA library and then screened
with a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype bearing the H protein
of MeV isolated from B-cells and F protein from the Edmonston
strain. As a result, a single cDNA clone capable of making trans-
fected 293T cells susceptible to MeV-H protein bearing pseudotype
was identiﬁed. The sequence of the clone was a homolog of signal-
ing lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM), and consequently,
human SLAM was identiﬁed as a lymphoid cell receptor for wild-
type MeV. Importantly, the Edmonston strain was found to utilize
SLAM, in addition to CD46, as a receptor, indicating that SLAM
acts as a receptor not only for B-cell line-isolated MeV strains
but also for vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains (Tatsuo et al.,
2000b).

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that MeV strains iso-
lated and propagated by SLAM-positive cells show clinical signs of
MeV in infected animals (van Binnendijk et al., 1994; McChesney
et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 1997; Auwaerter et al., 1999; El Mubarak
et al., 2007; Bankamp et al., 2008). Therefore, it has been veri-
ﬁed that SLAM acts as the principal cellular receptor for MeV
in vivo, and that use of CD46 may be the result of MeV adaptation
in vitro. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that all CDV and
RPV strains use dog and cow SLAM as a receptor, respectively, and
that SLAM is a common and principal receptor for morbillivirus
(Tatsuo et al., 2001).

Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule is also known as
CD150 and is expressed on thymocytes, activated lymphocytes,
mature dendritic cells, macrophages, and platelets in humans
and mice (Sidorenko and Clark, 1993; Cocks et al., 1995; Aversa
+
et al., 1997). In humans, CD14
monocytes in tonsils and spleens
express SLAM (Farina et al., 2004). SLAM is implicated in the
regulation of T-cell activation by affecting T-cell antigen receptor
signaling. In addition, SLAM has the ability to regulate the func-
tions of several other immune cell types, including natural killer
and dendritic cells. Hence, SLAM has a broad involvement in the
modulation of innate and acquired immune responses (Veillette
and Latour, 2003; Veillette et al., 2007; Schwartzberg et al., 2009).
Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule has two extracellular
immunoglobulin superfamily domains, V and C2, and is associ-
ated with the adaptor molecules, SLAM-associated protein (SAP),
or EWS/FliI-activated transcript 2 (EAT-2), in its cytoplasmic tail.

of its ectodomain. SCR1 and SCR2 interact with the laboratory strains of

C4b.

outbreaks of measles in colonies; however laboratory strains of
MeV do not induce disease in these animals (Kobune et al., 1990;
van Binnendijk et al., 1994, 1995; McChesney et al., 1997). Fur-
thermore, previous reports indicated that ﬁve strains of MeV
that were adapted for growth in Vero cells showed little patho-
genicity against experimentally infected macaques, whereas the
Bilthoven strain of MeV, which grew in human cord blood
cells, induced clinical symptoms of measles (Auwaerter et al.,
1999).

Although Vero cells had been used for MeV isolation for a long
time, the isolation was not highly efﬁcient and usually required
several blind passages. In contrast, Kobune et al. found that an
Epstein–Barr-virus-transformed marmoset B-cell line, B95a, is
10,000-fold more sensitive to the MeV present in clinical speci-
mens than Vero cells. Furthermore, MeVs isolated and propagated
in B95a cells cause clinical signs in experimentally infected mon-
keys, which resemble those of human measles such as rashes and
Koplik’s spots, leukopenia, and marked histological lesions in the
lymphoid tissues (Kobune et al., 1990). Subsequently, Kobune et al.
(1990, 1996) reported that two strains of wild MeV from the same
patient, one isolated in B95a cells and the other in Vero cells, had
different virulence in monkeys. The former induced acute signs of
MeV infection, whereas the latter did not induce any clinical signs
of disease and caused milder histological lesions. These ﬁndings
strongly indicated that MeV isolated in B95a cells maintains vir-
ulence similar to that in humans and that isolation in Vero cells
leads to loss of virulence.

Morbillivirus receptors

The extracellular domain of SLAM associates with another SLAM
molecule present on adjacent cells. In CD4
T-cells, ligation of
SLAM induces its binding to SAP, and combined with T-cell-
receptor (TCR)-mediated signals, triggers downstream signaling
for the production of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines such as IL-4 and
IL-13 (Veillette et al., 2007). Furthermore, SLAM controls produc-
tion of IL-12, tumor necrosis factor α, and nitric oxide, presumably
via EAT-2, by macrophages (Veillette et al., 2007).

The V domain of SLAM is necessary and sufﬁcient for MeV
receptor function and three amino acid residues, at positions 60,
61, and 63 of human SLAM, are crucial for its function (Ohno
et al., 2003; Figure 3). Meanwhile, mutagenesis of the H protein
based on its ability to induce SLAM-dependent cell–cell fusion has
revealed that residues important for interaction with SLAM are
I194, D505, D507, Y529, D530, T531, R533, H536, Y553, and P554
(Masse et al., 2004; Vongpunsawad et al., 2004; Navaratnarajah
et al., 2008).

SLAM ACTS AS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTOR FOR
MORBILLIVIRUS IN VIVO
Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-isolated strains express
typical clinical symptoms in experimental animal models. Thus,
the in vivo study of wild-type morbillivirus, in particular MeV
and CDV, has proceeded in conjunction with the establishment
of a novel method for generating recombinant virus, known as
reverse genetics (Billeter et al., 2009).

To identify the host cells that support infection, a recombinant
CDV that expressed green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) was produced
by reverse genetics, based on a wild-type strain that is lethal to
ferrets, and inoculated intranasally into animals (von Messling
et al., 2004). CDV initially infected lymphocytes and massively

replicated therein, thereby causing immunosuppression, systemic
invasion, and host escape. In contrast, replication in epithelial cells
was initially not detectable but substantial before host death.

In a similar manner, GFP-expressing MeV was also generated
and inoculated into macaques via the aerosol route, and the time
course of propagation was monitored (de Swart et al., 2007). MeV
entered the host at the alveolar level by infecting macrophages
or dendritic cells, which carried the virus to bronchus-associated
lymphoid tissue, followed by regional dissemination by viremia.

To further clarify the importance of SLAM for morbil-
livirus pathogenesis, recombinant viruses possessing H, which
are incapable of recognizing SLAM but can enter epithelial cells
(SLAM-blind), have been generated.

Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-blind CDV infected
primary ferret epithelial cells as efﬁciently as the parental wild-
type CDV but was incapable of entering ferret peripheral blood
mononuclear cells in vitro. Experimentally infected ferrets indi-
cated that the SLAM-blind virus is completely avirulent in ferrets;
infection with this virus caused only a small, short-lived decrease
in the blood leukocyte count (von Messling et al., 2006).

Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-blind MeV was also
generated and inoculated intranasally into rhesus monkeys. As a
result, the virus showed attenuated pathogenicity, inefﬁcient infec-
tion of lymphocytes, and induced no clinical symptoms in these
animals (Leonard et al., 2010).

Recently, our group has generated SLAM-blind RPV using a
lapinized strain (RPV-L). RPV-L is highly virulent in rabbits and
exhibits similar pathogenicity as virulent RPV in cattle. Thus,
RPV-L-infected rabbits should represent a useful model for study-
ing in vivo pathogenicity after RPV infection. SLAM-blind RPV-L
induced few clinical signs, which is in agreement with studies with
CDV and MeV, demonstrating that SLAM recognition is necessary
for virulence. The virus was not detected in any of the lymphoid
tissues, but was detected in lungs, suggesting that the SLAM-
blind RPV in rabbits could infect epithelial but not lymphoid cells
(unpublished data).

These results strongly indicated that SLAM-mediated cell entry

is crucial for expression of full pathogenicity of morbillivirus.

A PUTATIVE RECEPTOR ON EPITHELIAL CELLS
Distribution and functions of SLAM provide a good explanation
for the lymphotropism and immunosuppressive nature of mor-
billivirus. However, morbillivirus, in autopsied patients and some
experimentally infected animals, has also been shown to infect the
epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchial tubes, lungs, oral cavity,
pharynx, esophagus, intestines, liver, and bladder (Grifﬁn, 2007).
These epithelial cells do not express SLAM, but the infected cells
do shed virus, suggesting that entry into these SLAM-negative cells
is mediated by other cellular receptors.

In vitro studies have shown that a number of SLAM-negative
cell types of epithelial or neuronal origin result in cytopathic effects
and virus release. In particular, several well-differentiated polar-
ized epithelial cell lines showed high susceptibility to wild-type
MeV (Takeda et al., 2007; Tahara et al., 2008). Further in vitro
studies indicated that wild-type MeV enters human polarized air-
way epithelium basolaterally, whereas progeny viral particles are
released exclusively from the apical surface of these cells (Tahara

Morbillivirus receptors

et al., 2008; Ludlow et al., 2010). Moreover, it was shown that loss
of tight junction proteins induced by the transcription repressor
SNAIL blocked infection with MeV (Shirogane et al., 2010). These
data strongly implied that polarized epithelial cells possess a puta-
tive epithelial receptor, EpR, and that the receptor appears to be
expressed on the basolateral side of the cells that is associated with
tight junctions.

From these studies, before identiﬁcation of the components of
EpR, the region of the H protein that interacts with the EpR was
mapped to the H protein (I456, L464, L482, P497, Y541, and Y543;
Leonard et al., 2008; Tahara et al., 2008).

Based on these data, an EpR-blind MeV maintaining SLAM-
dependent cell entry was generated and inoculated intranasally
into monkeys (Leonard et al., 2008). As a result, EpR-blind MeV-
infected macaques developed signs of measles comparable to those
of animals infected with wild-type virus, including skin rash and
anorexia, indicating that the EpR-blind MeV remained virulent
in the macaques. However, EpR-blind MeV could not be isolated
from the tracheal aspirates of all of the monkeys, unlike wild-type
MeV. This strongly suggested that MeV crosses the respiratory
epithelium only when it leaves the host and that EpR-blind MeV
does not shed in the airways.

NECTIN-4
In 2011, two independent groups reported identiﬁcation of the
EpR. Both groups utilized microarray data from susceptible ver-
sus non-susceptible cell lines and compared the membrane protein
gene transcripts.

Noyce et al. (2011) described the susceptibility of many dif-
ferent tumor cell lines to MeV infection and selected susceptible
and non-susceptible cell lines. They ﬁltered the microarray data for
membrane protein genes, and produced a short list of 11 candidate
receptors. Of these, only human PVRL4 (nectin-4), a tumor cell
marker found on breast, lung, and ovarian carcinomas, rendered
cells susceptible to MeV infection. Transient knockdown of nectin-
4 using siRNA abolished MeV infection in these cell lines. Fur-
thermore, antibodies speciﬁc for human nectin-4 inhibited MeV
infection. Mühlebach et al. (2011) performed microarray analysis
of seven epithelial cell lines from human airways or bladder previ-
ously characterized as permissive (three lines) or non-permissive
(four lines), and identiﬁed that nectin-4 renders CHO cells suscep-
tible to MeV. It was demonstrated that the V domain of nectin-4
binds strongly to MeV-H (Mühlebach et al., 2011; Figure 4).

The nectin family is a cell adhesion molecule family compris-
ing four members (nectin-1–4), and only nectin-4 functions as the
EpR (Mühlebach et al., 2011; Noyce et al., 2011). Nectins contain
immunoglobulin-like domains, similar to SLAM. The nectin fam-
ily proteins have recently been shown to be essential contributors
to the formation of cell–cell adhesions and are novel regulators
of cellular activities, including cell polarization, differentiation,
movement, proliferation, and survival (Takai et al., 2008; Ogita
et al., 2010). Nectins are also involved in the establishment of
apical–basal polarity at cell–cell adhesion sites and the formation
of tight junctions in epithelial cells (Takai et al., 2008; Ogita et al.,
2010).

To date, details of the interaction mechanism of the newly iden-
tiﬁed receptor, nectin-4, with MeV-H has not been elucidated. In

FIGURE 4 | Structure of nectins. The nectin family proteins contain three
Ig-like loops (V and two C2-type domains) in their extracellular domain. Two
nectin and nectin-like molecules of the same plasma membrane ﬁrst form
cis-dimers, and then this is followed by the formation of a trans-interaction
between the Ig-like loops of cis-dimers located on opposing cells. MeV
binds to the V domain of nectin-4, speciﬁcally.

particular, it is unclear whether nectin-4 produces intracellular
signals upon engagement with MeV-H. Further studies are neces-
sary to clarify the implications of the interaction of MeV-H and
nectin-4 in MeV pathogenicity.

OVERVIEW OF MeV PROPAGATION IN THE INFECTED BODY
It has been postulated that the primary targets of MeV are SLAM-
positive alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes of
the immune system in the respiratory tract, rather than epithelial
cells. This contention is supported by the ﬁnding that almost all
CD14
monocytes in human tonsils express SLAM. MeV subse-
quently grows in SLAM-expressing lymphatic cells and spreads to
lymph nodes throughout the body. After systemic infection, it is
considered that the virus is transmitted from infected lymphocytes
and dendritic cells to epithelial cells using nectin-4 on the baso-
lateral side of epithelial cells, and virus particles are subsequently
shed from the apical surface of these cells (Figure 5).

ALTERNATIVE RECEPTORS
From the above studies, the major transmission mode of mor-
billivirus, especially MeV, has been drawn. However, many
histopathological studies have indicated that morbillivirus is also
detected in endothelial and neuronal cells (Grifﬁn, 2007), suggest-
ing the existence of other routes for virus propagation to these cell
types. In particular, MeV and CDV show strong neuronal tropism,
and cause acute and persistent encephalitis (Grifﬁn, 2007), nev-
ertheless neural cells neither express SLAM nor nectin-4. These
cells may have their own receptors or be infected by virus via an
inefﬁcient receptor.

Previous studies using recombinant morbilliviruses expressing
GFP have demonstrated that cell entry independent of SLAM and
CD46 (and probably nectin-4) occurs in a variety of cell lines with

low infectivity (Hashimoto et al., 2002; Fujita et al., 2007; Terao-
Muto et al., 2008). This suggests the existence of inefﬁcient but
ubiquitously expressed receptors.

Previously, we have found that infection with several SLAM
(and presumably nectin-4) negative cell lines with morbillivirus
was inhibited by soluble heparin, and that virus bound to immo-
bilized heparin. These results suggest that ubiquitously expressed
heparin-like glycosaminoglycans are involved in morbillivirus
infection (Fujita et al., 2007; Terao-Muto et al., 2008). More
recently, we have also demonstrated a unique infection mechanism
of MeV, in which viral particles incorporate cellular cyclophilin
(Cyp)B on their surface and bind to cellular CD147, a receptor for
CypA and B, independently of MeV-H (Watanabe et al., 2010). It is
known that CypA incorporated into HIV-1 particles translocates
to the surfaces of virions (Misumi et al., 2002), and that the inter-
action between CypA and CD147 enables HIV-1 to infect target
cells via CD147, independently of the binding of gp120 and CD4
(Pushkarsky et al., 2001). Additionally, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proposed to use CD147 as

a receptor in the same manner as HIV-1 (Chen et al., 2005). Unlike
HIV-1 and SARS-CoV, MeV uses CypB instead of CypA for bind-
ing to CD147. This ﬁnding is the ﬁrst among viruses belonging
to the order Mononegavirales and shows a new infection mode of
MeV, which is independent of H protein.

CONCLUSION
Investigations aimed at identifying the receptors for morbillivirus
started in 1993 with CD46 for vaccine strains of MeV, followed
by the lymphoid cell receptor, SLAM, in 2000, and the epithelial
cell receptor, nectin-4, in 2011, for wild-type viruses. Along with
the receptors, the cell tropism, transmission modes in the body,
and unique pathogenicities of morbillivirus are being explained.
However, many problems associated with morbillivirus remain to
be clariﬁed. In particular, the mechanism by which MeV spreads in
the central nervous system during fatal subacute sclerosing panen-
cephalitis is unknown. Further studies will lead to a better under-
standing of morbillivirus pathogenesis and to novel strategies for
treatment and prevention.
