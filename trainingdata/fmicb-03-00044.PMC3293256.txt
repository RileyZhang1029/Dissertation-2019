Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a member of the herpesvirus family, has
evolved to establish a long-term, latent infection of cells such that while they carry the viral
genome gene expression is highly restricted. Latency is a state of cryptic viral infection
associated with genomic persistence in their host and this hallmark of KSHV infection leads
to several clinical–epidemiological diseases such as KS, a plasmablastic variant of multi-
centric Castleman’s disease, and primary effusion lymphoma upon immune suppression
of infected hosts. In order to sustain efﬁcient life-long persistency as well as their life cycle,
KSHV dedicates a large portion of its genome to encode immunomodulatory proteins that
antagonize its host’s immune system. In this review, we will describe our current knowl-
edge of the immune evasion strategies employed by KSHV at distinct stages of its viral life
cycle to control the host’s immune system.

INTRODUCTION
Herpesviruses have co-evolved with their hosts for more than
one hundred million years. During this coevolution, hosts have
come to equip themselves with elaborate immune system to defend
themselves from invading viruses and other pathogens. In order
to establish infection and maintain latency, herpesviruses have
acquired a number of genes that cause selective suppression of
normal immune system functions and allow for an apathogenic,
persistent infection.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV; also known as
human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)] is a large double-stranded, DNA
oncogenic virus belonging to the gammaherpesvirus subfamily.
Its genome consists of a long unique region (LUR) encoding over
87 open reading frames (ORFs), at least 17 microRNAs, and a
variable number of GC-rich 801-bp large terminal repeat (TR)
elements. Like all other herpesviruses, KSHV can adopt one of
two lifestyles known as latency and lytic replication. In latency,
the viral genome is retained as a circular episome in the nucleus,
expressing only a minimal number of genes without producing
progeny virions. Lytic replication can be induced from the latency
state by a single master-switch viral gene, which encodes a tran-
scription factor known as RTA. The switch to lytic replication
from latency leads to the expression of the entire viral genome as
well as the production of progeny virions. Interestingly, KSHV
dedicates almost a quarter of its genome to immunomodula-
tory genes, most of which seem to be pirated from the host and
are cellular orthologs. Through these proteins, KSHV has devel-
oped elaborate mechanisms for outsmarting and adapting to the
host’s immune responses, ultimately establishing a life-long, per-
sistent infection within an immunocompetent host after primary
infection.

Herein, we summarize recent advances in our understanding
of how KSHV utilizes immunomodulatory genes to subvert the
antiviral immune responses of its host (Figure 1 and Table 1).

HOST IMMUNE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The immune system provides numerous mechanisms of pro-
tection against invading pathogens like viruses. These immune
responses include both broad spectrum, innate responses, and
highly speciﬁc, adaptive responses. The innate immune system is
our ﬁrst line of defense against invading organisms while the adap-
tive immune system acts as a second line of defense that also affords
protection against re-exposure to the same pathogen. In order
to overcome innate responses, KSHV proteins deregulate inter-
feron responses, the complement cascade, inﬂammatory cytokine
production, natural killer (NK) cell immunity, Toll-like receptors
(TLRs), apoptosis, and autophagy pathways. Furthermore, KSHV
employs several strategies to block the two adaptive arms of the
immune system: the humoral immune response arm (production
of antibodies by B cells) and the cellular immune response arm
(activities carried out by cytotoxic CD4

and CD8

T cells).

INNATE IMMUNITY
Interferon
Interferon (IFN) plays an important role as a primary defense
mechanism against viral infection by inhibiting viral replica-
tion, suppressing cell growth, promoting apoptosis, upregulating
antigen presentation, and modulating several signal transduction
pathways. To date, three distinct classes of IFN designated as types
I to III have been identiﬁed, classiﬁed according to their receptor
complex and amino acid sequence (Pestka et al., 2004; Sadler and
Williams, 2008). Type II IFN consists of a single gene, IFN-γ, that

can interact with IFN-γ receptor (IFNγR) complexes and induce
broad immune responses to pathogens other than viruses. Type III
IFNs (namely, IFN-λ1, -λ2, and -λ3, also known as IL-28/29), and
type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) mainly regulate antiviral responses. Virus-
activated IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) undergo phosphorylation,
dimerization, and nuclear translocation, ultimately turning on
positive regulators of the transcription of type I IFN and type
III IFN genes (Sadler and Williams, 2008; Trinchieri, 2010).

Remarkably, KSHV encodes four viral IRFs (vIRF1–4) that
show homology with cellular IRFs in one cluster region of its
genome, and employs them as negative regulators that subvert
host IFN-mediated immune responses (Takaoka et al., 2008). They
are all expressed during lytic reactivation, but vIRF1 and vIRF3
[also know as latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA2)] have
also been detected in latently infected cells. This suggests that
although vIRFs may function redundantly, they may act indepen-
dently depending on the cell type and the stage of the viral lifecycle
to thereby elicit disparate and distinct mechanisms of IFN evasion
(Cunningham et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2009a). A number of pre-
vious studies have shown that vIRFs associate with and regulate
cellular IRFs, other transcriptional factors and cofactors rather
than directly interacting with DNA to inhibit IFN-induced gene
transcripts (Takaoka et al., 2008; Tamura et al., 2008; Lee et al.,
2009a, 2010).

vIRF1 (K9). Viral IRF1 was the ﬁrst vIRF found to effectively
repress cellular IFN responses (Gao et al., 1997; Zimring et al.,
1998). vIRF1 does not compete with IRF1 for DNA binding
although it inhibits IRF1 transcriptional activity (Zimring et al.,
1998). Alternatively, vIRF1 binds to transcriptional cofactor p300
and interferes with CBP/p300–IRF3 complex formation along
with p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, thus prevent-
ing IRF3-mediated transcriptional activation (Li et al., 2000; Lin
et al., 2001).

length vIRF2, translated from two
spliced exons (K11 and K11.1), accelerates IRF3 degradation and
inhibits IRF3 transactivation, thereby repressing IRF3-mediated
IFN-β transcriptional activity (Areste et al., 2009). In addition,
vIRF2 inhibits IFN-α/β driven signaling as well as signaling
induced by IFN-λ (Fuld et al., 2006). The underlying mechanism,
however, has yet to be deﬁned. In a recent study, vIRF2 reduced
the activation of the IFN-induced interferon-response element
(ISRE) promoter through the deregulation of IFN-stimulated gene
factor-3 (ISGF-3), (Mutocheluh et al., 2011). It is suggested that
vIRF2 possesses pleiotropic activity of inhibiting early type I IFN
(IFN enhanceosome-dependent) and delayed type I IFN (ISGF-
dependent) responses. Previous studies have shown that the ﬁrst
exon of vIRF2 (K11.1) interacts with cellular IRF1, IRF2, IRF8,
RelA, and p300 (Burysek and Pitha, 2001). Furthermore, vIRF2
prevents PKR kinase activity to overcome IFN-α/β-mediated
antiviral effects (Burysek and Pitha, 2001).

vIRF3 (K10.5). Viral IRF3 interaction with cellular IRF7 sup-
presses IRF7 DNA binding activity and, therefore, inhibits IFN-
mediated immunity through the inhibition of IFN-α production
(Joo et al., 2007). Remarkably, a putative double α-helix motif of
vIRF3 (residues 240–280) that has been shown to be responsible

for the interaction of vIRF3 with IRF7 is also sufﬁcient to bind
to IRF5 (Wies et al., 2009). As a result of this interaction, vIRF3
inhibits IRF5-mediatd ISRE and IFN-β promoter activity (Wies
et al., 2009). It was recently shown that vIRF3 is required for the
survival of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. RNA inter-
ference (RNAi) knockdown of vIRF3 in PEL cells reduced cell
proliferation by releasing IRF5 from p21 promoter transcription
complexes.

While it remains to be discovered whether vIRF4, the most
recently identiﬁed member of the vIRF family, affects IFN-
mediated innate immunity, the downregulation of the IFN-
regulatory pathway is a common characteristic of the vIRFs, whose
functions have been well studied, as IRF3 and IRF7 are key initi-
ation factors of the host immune surveillance program against
viral infection. Accordingly, in addition to vIRFs, other viral pro-
teins restrain the type I and II IFN signaling pathways. The LANA
protein, expressed during viral latency, competes with IRF3 for
binding to the IFN-β promoter, thus preventing the expression of
the CREB-binding protein as well as inhibiting IFN-β transcrip-
tion (Cloutier and Flamand, 2010). Three immediately early gene
products, K8, ORF45, and RTA, are also involved in the inhibition
of IFN pathway in distinctive manners. The K8 (K-bZIP) pre-
cludes efﬁcient IFN-β gene expression by impeding IRF3 binding
to the IFN-β promoter through a direct interaction with the IFN-β
promoter (Lefort et al., 2007). ORF45 interacts with IRF7, pre-
venting its phosphorylation and subsequent translocation into the
nucleus, hence impairing this ampliﬁcation loop in type I IFN pro-
duction (Zhu et al., 2002). RTA antagonizes type I IFN-mediated
antiviral response, enhancing the ability of RTA-associated ubiqui-
tin ligases (RAUL) to degrade IRF7 and IRF3 (Yu et al., 2005;Yu and
Hayward, 2010). Much less is known about the state of type I IFN
signaling in infected cells. Bisson et al. (2009) demonstrated that
lytically infected cells display profound defects in IFN-mediated
STAT activation. More recent studies have demonstrated that an
early protein RIF (the product of ORF10) forms complexes with
Jak1, Tyk2, STAT2, and both IFNAR subunits, resulting in the
inhibition of the kinase activities of both Jak1 and Tyk2 (Bisson
et al., 2009). In addition, KSHV ORF64, a tegument protein with
deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, suppresses retinoic acid-inducible
gene I-mediated IFN signaling by reducing the ubiquitination
of RIG-1 upon KSHV infection (Inn et al., 2011). In summary,
KSHV dedicates almost 10% of its gene production to modu-
lating host IFN responses, further indicating the importance of
IFN-mediated innate immunity as a primary defense mechanism
against viral infection. Recently, HIV-1 Vpu led to the discov-
ery of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein, tetherin
(BST-2, CD317), as a novel component of host innate defense
against enveloped viruses. Thus far, six viral proteins have been
reported to counteract tetherin: HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2, SIV Env, SIV
Nef, Ebola glycoprotein (GP), and KSHV K5 (Neil et al., 2008; Van
Damme et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Le Tortorec
and Neil, 2009; Mansouri et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). KSHV
K5 induces the proteasomal degradation of tetherin during pri-
mary infection and upon reactivation from latency in endothelial
cells. Furthermore, tetherin reduces KSHV release upon inhibition
of K5 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA), suggesting
that tetherin is part of the IFN-induced innate immune response
against KSHV (Mansouri et al., 2009; Pardieu et al., 2010).

Regulation of the host immune system by KSHV

p53 tumor suppression regulation
p53 (also known as tumor protein 53, TP53) is a transcriptional
factor often described as the “guardian of the genome” because
of its major roles in cell cycle arrest and in inducing apoptosis
in response to a myriad of cellular stresses such as DNA dam-
age and viral infection (Vogelstein et al., 2000; Collot-Teixeira
et al., 2004). Therefore, viruses openly employ products that over-
come the action of p53 to circumvent its growth-suppressive and
proapoptotic actions (Coscoy, 2007; Liang et al., 2008; Lee et al.,
2009a).

p53 is activated in a speciﬁc manner by post-translational mod-
iﬁcations that lead to either cell cycle arrest, a program that induces
cell senescence, or cellular apoptosis. Activation of the p53 net-
work by stressors including virus replication and DNA damage is
marked by two major events. First, the half-life of the p53 protein
is increased drastically, leading to a quick accumulation of p53 in
stressed cells (Collot-Teixeira et al., 2004). Second, a conforma-
tional change activates p53 as a transcriptional regulator in these
cells, stimulating the phosphorylation and acetylation of p53 to
increase the levels of activated p53. Activated p53 then binds to its
regulatory region, which activates the expression of several target
genes leading to diverse cellular responses, such as apoptosis, cell
cycle arrest, or DNA repair (Harris and Levine, 2005). When p53
is no longer needed, it is ubiquitinated by murine double minute
2 (MDM2) and translocates from the nucleus to be degraded
(Michael and Oren, 2003; Bond et al., 2005). In order to hinder
p53-mediated irreversible cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, viruses
need to tightly regulate the expression and/or functions of p53.

Viral IRFs. Notably, mounting studies show that vIRFs have
remarkable functional redundancy in inhibiting p53-mediated cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. vIRF1 suppresses its acetylation, imped-
ing the transcriptional activation of p53, resulting in a decrease
in p53 target gene expression and transcription (Nakamura et al.,
2001; Seo et al., 2001). Moreover, vIRF1 blocks ATM kinase activity,
thereby reducing p53 phosphorylation and increasing p53 ubiq-
uitination (Shin et al., 2006). Like vIRF1, vIRF3, and vIRF4 also
interfere with p53 signaling. The B cell-speciﬁc, latently expressed
vIRF3 inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional activity and apopto-
sis through its interaction with p53, although the way in which
it targets the p53 pathway is not clear (Rivas et al., 2001). vIRF4
targets two major components, HAUSP and MDM2, of the p53
pathway to effectively reducing p53 and suppressing p53-mediated
apoptosis. Furthermore, vIRF4’s actions with HAUSP and MDM2
are functionally and genetically separable and the vIRF4–MDM2
interaction has a more signiﬁcant role in downregulating p53 than
the vIRF4–HAUSP interaction (Lee et al., 2009b, 2011).

LANA (ORF73). Similar to vIRF3, the LANA also acts as neg-
ative regulator of the p53 pathway. LANA physically interacts
with p53 to repress its transcriptional and translational activity
(Friborg et al., 1999; Si and Robertson, 2006; Chen et al., 2010).
Ultimately, LANA inhibits the ability of p53 to induce cell death,
thereby, promoting chromosomal instability (Friborg et al., 1999;
Si and Robertson, 2006). Initially, the modulation of p53 transcrip-
tional activity by LANA was reported to be neither through p53
degradation nor inhibition of its DNA binding ability. However, a
later report indicated that expression of LANA leads to decreased

p53 protein levels due to LANA enhanced ubiquitination and
degradation of p53 (Suzuki et al., 2010).

Cytokine regulation
Viral
infection stimulates the production of cytokines and
chemokines, secreted proteins that enable either the positive or
negative regulation of the immune responses. They have crucial
roles in inducing the migration of immune cells to areas of infec-
tion, immune regulation, antiviral defense, as well as the capacity
of targets cells to support viral replication. Therefore, it is not
surprising to ﬁnd that many viruses beneﬁt from an antagonism
of cytokine activity by encoding proteins homologous to cellular
cytokines (virokines), chemokine receptors (viroceptors), and/or
secreting chemokine-binding proteins. Alternatively, viruses also
utilize viral proteins to neutralize cytokine activities and may use
cytokine pathways to induce cell proliferation, cell migration, or
control homeostasis to enhance viral replication.

Viral cytokine (vIL-6). KSHV K2, an early lytic gene, encodes
a viral interleukin, vIL-6, which shows homology to cellular IL-6
(Swanton et al., 1997). vIL-6 directly binds to and activates gp130
without the need of the gp80 α-subunit of the IL-6 receptor for IL-
6 signal transduction (Molden et al., 1997; Hoischen et al., 2000;
Chow et al., 2001; Chatterjee et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2009). As
a functional consequence, vIL-6 mimics a number of IL-6 activ-
ities, including stimulation of IL-6 dependent proliferation of B
cells, activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and stimulation of cells
by intracellular signaling (Molden et al., 1997; Burger et al., 1998;
Meads and Medveczky, 2004). Furthermore, vIL-6 plays impor-
tant roles as an angiogenic factor through the induction of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; Aoki et al., 1999), the promotion
of Th2-cell development by increasing CCL2 expression, as well
as blocking IFN response (Chatterjee et al., 2002; Diehl and Rin-
con, 2002). Moreover, secreted vIL-6 can be detected from latently
infected KSHV-positive B cells and contributes to the survival and
growth of PEL cells (Moore et al., 1996; Foussat et al., 1999; Mori
et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2009). Hence, it is indicated that vIL-6 has
distinctive functions in latency, where it promotes the growth and
survival of infected cells for the maintenance of the latent virus
within host cells, and lytic replication, where it protects virally
infected cells from undergoing growth arrest and cell death.

Viral chemokines (vCCL-1, vCCL-2, vCCL-3). KSHV contains
three virally encoded chemokines: vCCL-1 (K6/vMIP-I), vCCL-
2 (K4/vMIP-II), and vCCL-3 (K4.1/vMIP-III), (Lee et al., 2010).
vCCL-1, vCCL-2, and vCCL-3 can activate signal transduction
through CCR3/CCR8, CCR8, and CCR4, respectively. Interest-
ingly, they appear to be chemoattractants that speciﬁcally target
Th2 lymphocytes as these chemokine receptors are preferentially
expressed on Th2 cells, and not Th1 cells (Choi and Nicholas,
2008). It is indicated that KSHV CCLs act as Th2-cell chemokine-
receptor agonists and can polarize the adaptive immune response
toward a predominantly Th2-type response at sites of KSHV infec-
tion, potentially reducing the efﬁcacy of host antiviral responses.
Likewise, vCCL-2 acts as an antagonist by inhibiting a broad range
of CC and CXC receptors expressed by Th1 cells and effectively
blocks the RANTES-induced arrest of monocytes while promot-
ing the arrest of eosinophils (Chen et al., 1998; Weber et al., 2001;

Regulation of the host immune system by KSHV

Choi and Nicholas, 2008). Aside from their immune modula-
tory functions, vCCLs may further contribute to KSHV-associated
disease by enhancing angiogenic responses through the induction
of VEGF (Masood et al., 1997; Nakamura et al., 1997; Dittmer
et al., 1998).

vGPCR (ORF74). The KSHV-encoded vGPCR (ORF74) is a
seven-transmembrane, IL-8 receptor homolog that possesses
promiscuous chemokine-binding activity (Swanton et al., 1997;
Bais et al., 2003). Moreover, it has been shown that vGPCR
constitutively activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascades, p38 MAPK (Sodhi et al., 2000), Akt/protein kinase B
(Cannon, 2007), mTOR (Montaner, 2007), as well as some small
GTPases, like RhoA and Rac1 (Bottero et al., 2010). Consequently,
certain transcription factors, including AP-1, NFAT, NF-κB, HIF-
α, and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)
have been shown to be activated by vGPCR expression, which
in turn, lead to the expression of growth factors, proinﬂammatory
cytokines, as well as angiogenic factors (Sodhi et al., 2000; Cannon
et al., 2003; Cannon and Cesarman, 2004; Montaner et al., 2004).
Expression of vGPCR in transgenic mice causes KS-like lesions
characterized by increased vascularization and the recruitment of
inﬂammatory cells (Bais et al., 2003; Montaner et al., 2003). Among
the multiple intracellular pathways stimulated by vGPCR men-
tioned above, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has recently drawn
great attention for its contribution to KS development. Notably,
vGPCR expression was detected in only a very few cells within the
tumor mass and other tissues, indicating that there is a paracrine
effect, perhaps due to the enhanced activation of PI3Kγ (Martin
et al., 2011). The fact that expression of vGPCR is restricted to the
lytic phase of KSHV replication has raised arguments against its
role in pathogenesis and further examination will be required.

vCD200 (K14). Another negative regulator of inﬂammatory sig-
naling is K14, a surface glycoprotein (vOX2) expressed during the
early lytic phase. It shows signiﬁcant homology with OX2, also
named CD200, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
that is broadly distributed on the surface of cells (Chung et al.,
2002). It was initially thought that vCD200 promotes the secre-
tion of proinﬂammatory cytokines upon stimulation of mono-
cytes, macrophages and DCs through an undeﬁned receptor, to
promote cytokine-mediated proliferation of KSHV-infected cells
(Chung et al., 2002). However, vCD200 was later shown to down-
modulate proinﬂammatory cytokines via a direct interaction with
cellular CD200R, inhibiting myeloid cell activation and reduc-
ing Th1-cell-associated cytokine production (Foster-Cuevas et al.,
2004; Rezaee et al., 2005; Shiratori et al., 2005). Furthermore,
vCD200 has also been shown to suppress neutrophil-mediated
inﬂammation in mice (Rezaee et al., 2005), suggestive of vCD200-
mediated immunosuppressive activities in KSHV infection. Over-
all, mounting data has led to the conclusion that vCD200 can cause
immune dysfunction associated with persistent infection, but the
immunomodulatory role of vCD200 is still controversial. Recently,
Salata et al. (2009) reported that vCD200 acts as a proinﬂamma-
tory stimulus in the early stage of viral infection (or reactivation),
while contributing to the downregulation of macrophage immune
response activities, from phagocytosis to antigen presentation, in
later stages.

TLR signaling
Toll-like receptors are transmembrane proteins expressed by vari-
ous immune and non-immune cells of the innate immune system
that recognize invading infectious agents and initiate signaling
pathways, culminating in the increased expression of immune and
inﬂammatory genes. To date, 11 human TLRs and 13 murine TLRs
have been identiﬁed. Each TLR contains 21–25 leucine-rich repeat
regions that speciﬁcally recognize a variety of pathogen associ-
ated molecular patterns (PAMPs), (Akira et al., 2006). TLRs are
expressed in distinct cellular compartments: TLR1, TLR2, TLR4,
TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed on the cell surface, whereas TLR3,
TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are expressed in intracellular vesicles such
as the endosome and ER (O’Neill and Bowie, 2010). Accumulated
evidence in relation to TLR signal transduction has demonstrated
that TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are involved in the
recognition of viruses by way of binding to RNA, DNA, or viral
glycoproteins (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Kawai and Akira, 2006). A
recent growing body of information is beginning to shed light on
TLR recognition of KSHV: KSHV infection of human monocytes
enhance TLR3 expression and induction of cytokines including
IFN-β1, CCL2, and CXCL10 (West and Damania, 2008). Infec-
tion of endothelial cells with KSHV causes suppression of TLR4
through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) MAPK pathway via viral gene expression-independent
mechanisms and viral gene expression dependent mechanisms by
way of vIRF1 and vGPCR (Lagos et al., 2008). In addition, stim-
ulation of TLR7 and TLR8 reactivates KSHV in latently infected
B lymphocytes (Gregory et al., 2009). A later study has shown
that KSHV infection of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) acti-
vates the TLR9 signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of
CD83 and CD86, and secretion of IFN-α (West et al., 2011). Over-
all, there is evidence that KSHV has developed different ways to
escape TLR-mediated detection throughout their lifecycle to limit
KSHV lytic replication and facilitate the establishment of latency.

Modulation of inﬂammasome pathway
Inﬂammasomes are emerging as key regulators of host responses
against infectious agents. When a pathogen invades sterile tis-
sues or elicits cellular damage, it can cause the activation of NLRs
(nucleotide binding and oligomerization, leucine-rich repeat) that
then trigger inﬂammasomes, molecular platforms composed of
oligomers of speciﬁc NLRs, pro-caspase 1, and an adaptor pro-
tein called ASC (apoptotic-associated speck-like; Martinon et al.,
2002). These cytosolic multiprotein complexes activate cysteine
protease caspase 1, leading to the processing and secretion of the
proinﬂammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 (Masters et al.,
2009; Schroder and Tschopp, 2010; Lamkanﬁ and Dixit, 2011).
In addition, production of IL-1β and IL-18 is associated with
a caspase 1-mediated inﬂammatory cell death program known
as pyrotosis (Ting et al., 2008; Miao et al., 2010). Therefore, it
is not surprising that viruses have evolved a variety of strate-
gies to interfere with inﬂammasome activation and downstream
signaling cascades (Lamkanﬁ and Dixit, 2011).

Recently, Gregory et al. found that KSHV ORF63 shows
sequence similarity to a NLR family member, NLRP1, and hinders
the interaction between NLRP1 and pro-caspase 1 through a direct
interaction with NLRP1 oligomerization domains. Thus, ORF63

Regulation of the host immune system by KSHV

reduces caspase 1 activity and lowers production of IL-1β and
IL-18. Interestingly, ORF63 also interacts with two additional
NLR family members, NOD2 and NLRP3, and may thus broadly
inhibit NLR inﬂammasome responses (Gregory et al., 2011).
Taken together, KSHV deploys ORF63 to prevent inﬂammasome
assembly and further enhance viral virulence.

Apoptosis and autophagy
A common cellular defense against pathogenic invasion is cell
death by two programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms: apop-
tosis (“self-killing”) and autophagy (“self-eating”), (Maiuri et al.,
2007). These two PCDs are characterized by distinctive morpho-
logical and biochemical changes and both are highly conserved and
tightly regulated processes that are essential for cell homeostasis,
disease, and development. Apoptosis is the best-described cellu-
lar suicide mechanism against invading pathogens that involves
a cascade of internal proteolytic digestion that result in the rapid
demolition of cellular infrastructure (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004;
Green, 2005). By contrast, autophagy has been historically recog-
nized as a cellular survival program that is involved in homeostasis
by removing damaged or superﬂuous organelles through lysoso-
mal degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic material delivered
to autophagosomes (Maiuri et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010; Liang
and Jung, 2010). Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests
that apoptosis and autophagy are not mutually exclusive path-
ways even though these two pathways seem to act independently.
The functional relationship between apoptosis and autophagy is
complex, with autophagy serving as a cell survival pathway that
suppresses apoptosis that can also lead to cellular demise called
autophagic cell death (type II PCD) in other cellular settings.
Currently, a number of pathways that link the apoptotic and
autophagic machineries and polarize the cellular response to favor
one over the other have been deciphered at the molecular level. For
instance, several apoptosis signaling molecules including TNF-
α, TRAIL, FADD, and p53, also mediated autophagy. Likewise,
Atg5, an autophagy effector, triggers apoptosis through its inter-
action with FADD (Mills et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2005; Levine,
2005; Lum et al., 2005; Pyo et al., 2005; Thorburn et al., 2005),
while the inhibition of the class I PI3K, AKT, and mTOR path-
ways suppress both apoptosis and autophagy (Arico et al., 2001).
Hence, it is not surprising that KSHV employs some gene prod-
ucts that target the crosstalk between apoptotic and autophagic
signaling to evade and subvert this part of the overall host sur-
veillance mechanism directed at blocking viral replication and
dissemination.

vFLIP (K13). The K13 (ORF71) latent viral gene encodes
viral FLICE (Fas-associated death-domain like IL-1 β-converting
enzyme) inhibitory protein (vFLIP), a truncated homolog of cel-
lular FLIP (cFLIP), (Dittmer et al., 1998; Fakhari and Dittmer,
2002). The vFLIP gene is expressed in KS and PEL cells from
a polycistronic mRNA encompassing the latency locus. As such,
vFLIP can inhibit extrinsic death-receptor-mediated apoptosis
pathway by preventing the activation of caspases, including cas-
pase 8 (Djerbi et al., 1999), and additionally associates with the
IKK complex and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to induce the
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins via the activation of NF-κB

(Chaudhary et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2002; Field et al., 2003; Bubman
et al., 2007). The induction of NF-κB activity has been linked to
at least two aspects of KSHV-infected pathogenesis: viral latency
and oncogenesis. On the other hand, NF-κB activation by vFLIP is
crucial for its inhibition of lytic replication via the AP-1 pathway
(Zhao et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2008). vFLIP likely contributes to a
proinﬂammatory microenvironment given that its expression was
found to induce NF-κB-regulated cytokine expression and secre-
tion (Grossmann et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2006). Taken together,
vFLIP appears to directly contribute to KSHV pathogenesis with
functions in viral infected cell survival, transformation, inﬂam-
matory activation and latency control. Lately, vFLIP has not only
been recognized to possess anti-apoptotic activities, but addition-
ally serves as an anti-autophagy protein through its prevention of
Atg3 binding to and processing of LC3, a protein involved in the
elongation step of autophagy (Lee et al., 2009c).

vBcl-2 (ORF16). KSHV ORF16 encodes the viral Bcl-2 protein
that generally shares 15–20% amino acid identity with human cel-
lular homologs and inhibits apoptosis induced by virus infection
and the pro-death protein BAX (Cheng et al., 1997; Sarid et al.,
1997). Furthermore, recent evidence shows that vBcl-2 suppresses
the cellular autophagy pathway through its direct interaction with
the autophagy protein Beclin-1 (Pattingre et al., 2005; Liang et al.,
2006). Although vBcl-2 possesses low degrees of homology with
most regions of cellular Bcl-2 except the Bcl-2 homology (BH)
1 and BH2 domains, vBcl-2 shares three-dimensional structural
conservation with Bcl-2 family members such that they all contain
a central hydrophobic cleft called the BH3-peptide binding groove
(Cheng et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2002; Loh et al., 2005). Interest-
ingly, the BH3 binding cleft of vBcl-2 binds with high afﬁnity
and speciﬁcity with BH3-containing molecules (BAX, BAK, BIM,
PUMA, BID, and Noxa) as well as selective binding to Beclin-1. It
is thus possible that vBcl-2 may direct apoptosis and autophagy
through a coordinated control of the two pathways. vBcl-2 is
transcribed during lytic viral infection (Sarid et al., 1997; Paulose-
Murphy et al., 2001) so inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy by
vBcl-2 may function to prolong the life-span of KSHV-infected
cells, which in turn enhances viral replication and establishment
of latency. In summary, KSHV has evolved to acquire viral versions
of Bcl-2 and FLIP to avoid elimination by the host’s apoptotic and
autophagy-mediated immune responses.

COMPLEMENT
The complement system has long been considered to be a part of
the innate immune defense system that also bridges innate and
adaptive immune responses, activated spontaneously in response
to pathogen surface components or antibodies to help clear
pathogens from an organism (Blue et al., 2004; Morgan et al.,
2005). The complement system is comprised of 30 different pro-
teins that are either circulating in the serum or attached to the cell
surface, and they shared a common structural motif known as the
short consensus repeat (SCR). They orchestrate three distinct cas-
cades, termed the classic, alternative, and mannose-binding lectin
pathways, which contribute to four major functions: lysis of infec-
tious organisms, activation of inﬂammation, opsonization, and
immune clearance. All three cascades converge at C3 convertase

assembly, which can either initiate the opsonization of the foreign
body or continue to activate C5 and thus propagate the cascade
(Dunkelberger and Song, 2010).

KCP (ORF4)
It is not surprising that KSHV encodes its own inhibitor of the
complement system in ORF4, designated as KSHV complement
control protein (KCP). Three lytic protein isoforms are produced
by alternative splicing (Spiller et al., 2003b). All three isoforms
retain four SCR domains and a transmembrane region, and can
regulate complement by accelerating the decay of the classical C3
convertase and acting as cofactors for the inactivation of C3b and
C4b, components of the C3 and C5 convertases (Spiller et al.,
2003a, 2006; Mark et al., 2008). KCPs are expressed and incorpo-
rated onto the surface of the virions during lytic infection, and have
been detected at the surface of de novo infected endothelial cells

after induction of lytic replication as well as at the surface of KSHV-
infected cells from patients with PEL (Spiller et al., 2003b, 2006).
Moreover, other γ-herpesviruses also encode KCP homologs indi-
cating that an anti-complement defense system is essential during
KSHV infection (Fodor et al., 1995; Kapadia et al., 1999; Okroj
et al., 2009).

ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY
B cell-dependent immune response
B lymphocytes are the major cell type involved in the creation of
antibodies, also known as humoral immunity. Antibodies (e.g.,
IgG, IgM, and IgA) are produced by plasma cells, have been stimu-
+
lated by CD4
Th cells, which activate B cells through a signaling
mechanism involving binding of CD40 on the B cell surface to
CD40 ligand. In lymph nodes, naïve B cells recognize cognate
antigen by their surface antibodies, become activated, switch from

Regulation of the host immune system by KSHV

IgM to IgG production (class-switch), increase their immunoglob-
ulin speciﬁcity and afﬁnity, and differentiate into plasma cells or
memory B cells as the cell continues to divide in the presence of
cytokines. As a general host defense mechanism, antibodies can
directly neutralize viruses by sterically hindering the receptor–
virus ligand interaction or by inducing conformational changes in
viral receptor ligands. Other indirect effects caused by antibodies
include the recruitment or activation of the innate immune effec-
tor system such as antibody-dependent cell cytoxicity (ADCC),
engulfment of antibody-coated (opsonized) viruses by phagocytes,
and complement activation. B cells are the likely cellular reservoir
of KSHV infection and KSHV seems to inﬂuence several aspects
of B cell biology through the modulation of humoral immune
responses.

Mounting evidence shows that a B cell terminal differentiation
factor, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), can effectively initiate
KSHV reactivation by activating the RTA promoter, thus provid-
ing a link between B cell development and KSHV pathogenesis
(Wilson et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007; Dalton-Grifﬁn et al., 2009).
Interestingly, PEL cells predominantly express the inactive form
of XBP-1, XBP-1u, but when the active form, XBP-1s, is induced,
the KSHV lytic cycle is activated (Reimold et al., 1996). This raises
the possibility that in KSHV-infected B cells, latency is maintained
until plasma cell differentiation occurs.

T cell-dependent immune response
Unlike B cells, T cells recognize antigenic determinants asso-
ciated with self MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-
presenting cells (APCs) instead of soluble antigens. Classically,
during viral infection, the recognition of viral peptides pre-
sented by MHC class I molecules on cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTLs) is a key event in the elimination of cells producing
abnormal or foreign proteins, speciﬁcally during a virus infec-
tion. CTLs thus play a critical role in the control of a viral
infection, especially as a long-term immune surveillance effector
that can more quickly react against the same virus after a pri-
mary infection (Micheletti et al., 2002). CTL evasion is hence
a prerequisite for the replication of persistent viruses particu-
larly in the case of herpesviruses, which must establish a persis-
tent, latent infection, and must then reactivate in immunologi-
cally primed hosts to shed infectious virions. All herpesviruses
implement strategies that target key stages of the MHC class I
antigen presentation pathway with the goal of preventing the pre-
sentation of viral peptide to CTLs (for review see Alcami and
Koszinowski, 2000; Ambagala et al., 2005). For instance, KSHV
encodes two well-known inhibitors of MHC class I cell sur-
face molecules that effectively suppress CTL response to virus
infected cells.

Inhibition of MHC class I antigen presentation. The K3 and K5
proteins, also known as modulator of immune recognition (MIR)
1 and MIR2, consist of an N-terminal RING-CH domain harbor-
ing ubiquitin E3 ligases activity and two transmembrane domains
responsible for substrate recognition (Lehner et al., 2005). In con-
trast to other viral inhibitors of MHC class I, K3 and K5 do
not affect assembly or transportation of MHC complexes to the
cell surface. Instead, they interact with MHC class I molecules

through transmembrane interactions and trigger endocytosis and
proteasomal degradation of MHC class I molecules without affect-
ing their assembly or transport by ubiquitinating its cytoplasmic
tail (Coscoy et al., 2001). Interestingly, K3 downregulates the
expression of both canonical and non-canonical MHC class I mol-
ecules in humans (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -E), whereas K5 primarily
downregulates HLA-A and -B alleles due to substrate speciﬁcity
arising from TM interactions (Coscoy and Ganem, 2000; Ishido
et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004). Addition-
ally, vIRF1 has been implicated to interact with p300 to prevent
basal transcription of MHC class I molecules and thereby down-
regulate MHC class I molecules on the cell surface of infected
cells (Lagos et al., 2007). Notably, from the viral perspective, the
virus must thwart both CTLs and NK cells because the down-
regulation of only MHC class I molecules renders infected cells
sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis. NK cells recognize infected
cells in an antigen-independent manner and destroy such cells
via cytotoxic activities. Furthermore, they can rapidly produce
large amounts of IFN-γ, which induces diverse antiviral immune
responses upon receptor activation, including the augmentation
of antigen presentation and activation/polarization of CD4
T
cells and macrophages (Goodbourn et al., 2000). Hence, K3 and
K5 also target gamma interferon receptor 1 (IFN-γR1) by induc-
ing its ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation, ultimately
resulting in the inhibition of IFN-γR1-mediated activation of
transcription factors (Li et al., 2007). Very recently, Schmidt et al.
reported that vIRF3 also contributes to viral immunoevasion by
downregulating of IFN-γ and class II transactivator (CIITA), thus
MHC class II expression (Schmidt et al., 2011). Overall, it is sug-
gested that the downregulation of surface MHC class I molecules
and IFN- γR1 by K3- and K5-mediated ubiquitination and lyso-
somal degradation inhibits primary host immunity against viral
infection.

+

Inhibition of co-stimulation. The generation of a robust adap-
tive immune response requires the engagement of T cells with
professional APCs such as DCs, macrophages, and B cells. To
sufﬁciently activate T cells, costimulatory signals such as the inter-
action between CD28 and its ligands, B7-1 and B7-2 on APC
surfaces (Sperling and Bluestone, 1996; Chambers and Allison,
1999), and between intercellular adhesion molecules 1 (ICAM1)
and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1; Dustin and
Springer, 1989) are essential. In addition to lowering the level of
MHC class I molecules, K5 also downregulates other components
of the immune synapse on the B cell surface such as ICAM (CD54)
and B7-2 (CD86), two co-activating molecules for NK cell activa-
tion, by inducing their endocytosis and degradation (Ishido et al.,
2000; Coscoy and Ganem, 2001).

Taken together, K3 seems to speciﬁcally target MHC class
I molecules, whereas K5 additionally targets multiple receptors
including MHC class I, CD86, and ICAM, with the overall effect
of preventing detection by CTL and NK cells (Nathan and Lehner,
2009; Manes et al., 2010). Even in a single gene overexpression sys-
tem, the resultant downregulation is sufﬁcient to confer resistance
to immune cells in culture, and therefore may protect KSHV-
infected cells undergoing lytic replication in vivo. The contribution
of K3 and K5 to immune evasion in the context of viral genome

Regulation of the host immune system by KSHV

during latency, however, is less clear. Their inﬂuence appears to
be most important in the early stages of KSHV infection, when
diminished detection by T cells can result in a reduced antiviral
cytokine responses and an impaired production of CTLs, thereby
allowing the virus to establish a persistent infection.

VIRAL microRNAs
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a copious class of evolutionarily con-
served small non-coding RNAs that are thought to modulate gene
expression post-transcriptionally by targeting mRNAs for degra-
dation or translational repression. miRNAs are 21–23 nucleotide
long RNAs that lack protein coding capacity and primarily reg-
(cid:2)
ulate gene expression by binding to the 3
untranslated region
(cid:2)
(3
UTR) of target mRNAs (Bartel, 2004). The genomic regions
encoding miRNAs are generally transcribed into primary miR-
NAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II. The nuclease Drosha
cleaves pri-miRNA into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), which
are further processed by Dicer to produce mature miRNAs. miR-
NAs are loaded into a protein complex known as the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) to inhibit the translation of target
mRNAs (Bartel, 2004). Through various methods of microRNA
target identiﬁcation, miRNA have been found to regulate diverse
biological processes including cell cycle, development, differen-
tiation, and metabolism. Given the propensity of viruses to co-
opt cellular systems and activities for their beneﬁt, it is perhaps
not surprising that several viruses have now been shown to
reshape the cellular environment by reprogramming the host’s
RNAi machinery. Indeed, most herpesviruses encode miRNAs
and KSHV in particular encodes 12 pre-miRNAs genes (miR-
K1–12) located in the latency locus (Ganem and Ziegelbauer,
2008; Cullen, 2009; Lei et al., 2010a; Ziegelbauer, 2011). These
pre-miRNAs are ultimately processed into mature miRNAs. Inter-
estingly, in some cases, mature miRNAs can undergo RNA edit-
(cid:2)
ing along with variations at the 5
end of the mature miRNA,
leading to at least ﬁve different mature miRNAs arising from
one pre-miRNA (Pfeffer et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2010; Umbach
and Cullen, 2010). Very recently, Gottwein et al. revealed that
KSHV miRNAs directly target numerous cellular mRNAs, includ-
ing many involved in pathways relevant to KSHV pathogenesis
and replication (Table 2). Notably, around 60% of these miR-
NAs are also target EBV miRNAs in PEL cells (Gottwein et al.,
2011).

Targeting of cellular mRNAs
As with other viral mechanisms of host interaction, viral miR-
NAs display redundancy in that multiple miRNAs target and
repress an individual cellular gene. In a gene expression pro-
ﬁle using microarray, Samols et al. identiﬁed a total of 81 genes
whose expression were signiﬁcantly changed in cells stably express-
ing KSHV-encoded miRNAs. Among them, thrombospondin 1
(THBS1), a major regulator of cell adhesion, migration, and angio-
genesis showed a signiﬁcant decrease by several KSHV miRNAs
including miR-K12-1, miR-K12-3-3p, miR-K-12-6-3p, and miR-
K-12-11. This consequently led to reduced TGF-β activity (Samols
et al., 2007). Hence, it is indicated that these KSHV miRNAs poten-
tially contribute to KS angiogenesis by repressing the expression
of an angiogenesis inhibitor, THBS1. Another microarray study
showed that at least four miRNAs (miR-K-12-5, -9, -10a, and -
10b) target BCLAF1 (BCL-2 associated factor). Intriguingly, these
miRNAs sensitized latently infected cells to stimuli that induce
lytic reactivation (Ziegelbauer et al., 2009). This is a different phe-
notype from that proposed for the effect of KSHV miRNAs on
its own viral proteins, RTA (Lei et al., 2010b; Lu et al., 2010).
Thus, it is suggested that KSHV employs its miRNAs to ﬁne-tune
gene regulation to either stabilize or destabilize latency. miR-K12-
10a, it causes the miR-K12-10a mediated knockdown of TWEAKR
(Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis receptor)
reduces the level of apoptosis and interleukin-8 (IL-8), (Abend
et al., 2010). Remarkably, the seed sequence of KSHV miR-K12-
11 is identical to that of cellular miR-155. These two miRNAs
consequently function as orthologs that downregulate the same
target genes including BACH-1(Gottwein et al., 2007; Skalsky et al.,
2007). Suppressing BACH-1 by miR-K12-11 increases expression
of an amino acid transport protein, xCT, which enables KSHV
propagation by cell fusion (Qin et al., 2010). Like HCMV and EBV,
KSHV miR-K12-7 has been shown to inhibit MICB (MHC class
I polypeptide-related sequence B) expression, thereby preventing
NK cell-mediated cell killing during KSHV infection (Nachmani
et al., 2009). To investigate the role of KSHV miRNAs in viral
latency, Lei et al. generated a mutant KSHV lacking its 14 miR-
NAs. Interestingly, KSHV miR-K12-1 targets the mRNA of NF-κB
inhibitor IκBα, thus promoting viral latency by activating NF-κB
(Lei et al., 2010b). miR-K12-1 was also found to inhibit the cellu-
lar dependent kinase inhibitor p21 through a different mechanism
(Gottwein and Cullen, 2010). KSHV miR-K12-4-5P epigeneti-
cally regulates KSHV lytic replication by inhibiting a repressor of
DNA methyl transferases, Rbl2 (retinoblastoma-like protein2), to
increase the mRNA levels of DNA methyl transferase 1, 3a, and 3b
(Iorio et al., 2007). In summary, KSHV miRNAs manipulate host
survival pathways to regulate viral latency and lytic replication.

Targeting of viral mRNAs
Currently, a validated viral target of KSHV miRNAs is RTA, a
well-known viral latent-lytic switch protein. In order to control
the expression of viral lytic genes, KSHV miR-K12-9
directly tar-
gets RTA (ORF50, lytic immediately early transcription factor) to
prevent viral reactivation (Lu et al., 2010). Another viral miRNA,
miR-K12-5, also antagonizes KSHV reactivation by consistently
inhibiting RTA expression (Lei et al., 2010b). Taken together, miR-
NAs are essential for controlling KSHV replication and latency by

CONCLUDING REMARKS
As we have seen, viruses have learned to manipulate host immune
control mechanisms to facilitate their propagation by using cap-
tured host genes or evolving genes to target speciﬁc immune
pathways. Thus, viral genomes can be regarded as repositories
of important information of immune processes, offering us a
viral view of the host immune system. Hence, studies that add
to our growing knowledge of viral immunomodulatory proteins
might help us uncover new human genes that control immunity.
Their characterization will increase our understanding of not only
viral pathogenesis, but also normal immune mechanisms. Fur-
thermore, mechanisms used by viral proteins suggest strategies
of immune modulation that might have therapeutic potential.
With regards to the discovery of potential therapeutic reagents
through virus research, our recent study sets a notable precedent:
two peptides derived from the KSHV vIRF4 can additively inhibit

HAUSP, leading to p53-mediated tumor regression (Lee et al.,
2011). Despite this signiﬁcant advance, it is only the tip of the ice-
berg. Although numerous immune evasion mechanisms employed
by KSHV seem to be well understood, it is too early to translate
the knowledge we have obtained from basic science research into
developing more effective clinical management and therapies due
to the absence of tractable tissues culture or in vivo models for
KSHV. Time after time, there is more to be learned from viruses.
