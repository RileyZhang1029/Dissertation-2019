ABSTRACT

Previously,  we  reported  that  glucose-deprived  astrocytes  are  more  vulnerable  to  the 
cytotoxicity  of  peroxynitrite,  the  reaction  product  of  nitric  oxide  and  superoxide  anion. 
The  augmented  vulnerability  of  glucose-deprived  astrocytes  to  peroxynitrite  cytotoxicity 
was  dependent  on  their  proliferation  rate.  Inhibition  of  cell  cycle  progression  has  been 
shown  to  inhibit  the  apoptotic  cell  death  occurring  in  cerebral  ischemia-reperfusion.  In 
the  present  study,  we  demonstrate  that  the  increased  death  of  glucose-deprived  as-
trocytes  by  peroxynitrte  was  largely  blocked  by  the  cell  cycle  phase  G2/M  transition 
blocker  etoposide.  However,  the  cytoprotective  effect  of  etoposide  was  not  associated 
with  its  inhibition  of  cell  cycle  progression.  Instead,  etoposide  effectively  scavenged 
peroxynitrite.  However,  etoposide  did  not  scavenge  individual  nitric  oxide  and  super-
oxide  anion  and  it  did  not  prevent  the  hydrogen  peroxide-induced  cytotoxicity.  The 
present  results  indicate  that  etoposide  prevents  the  toxicity  of  peroxynitrite  in  astrocytes 
by  directly  scavenging  peroxynitrite,  not  by  inhibiting  cell  cycle  progression.

trocytes  themselves  became  highly  vulnerable  to 
glucose  deprivation  (GD)  (Choi  and  Kim,  1998; 
Choi  et  al.,  2001).  This  enhanced  vulnerability  was 
−
attributed  to  the  accumulation  of  ONOO
  due  to 
the  disruption  of 
intracellular  antioxidant  system 
(i.e.,  decreased  level  of  reduced  glutathione)  in 
glucose-deprived  immunostimulated  astrocytes  (Choi 
and  Kim,  1998a;  1998b;  Choi  et  al.,  2000;  2001). 
−
Expectedly,  the  ONOO
-releasing  reagent  3-mor-
pholinosydnonimine  (SIN-1)  also  augmented 
the 
death  of  glucose-deprived  astrocytes.  Interestingly, 
we  further  found  that  the  augmented  death  of  im-
munostimulated  or  SIN-1-treated  astrocytes  under 
GD  was  dependent  on  the  proliferative  state  of  the 
astrocytes  (Choi  and  Kim,  1998b). 
    Activation  of  iNOS  was  reported  to  induce  cy-
totoxicity  in  part  by  disturbing  cell  cycle  progression 

(Gu  et  al.,  2000;  Kotamraju  et  al.,  2007).  Apoptotic 
death  of  some  cells  can  be  blocked  by  coordinating 
the  progression  through  the  cell  cycle  and/or  by 
preventing  the  inappropriate  activation  of  cell  cycle 
signalling  pathways  (Park  et  al.,  1997;  Zhu  et  al., 
2007).  Because  proliferating  immunostimulated  as-
trocytes  are  much  more  vulnerable  to  GD,  it  is 
reasonable  to  think  that  the  augmented  death  could 
be  prevented  by  inhibition  of  cell  cycle  progression. 
    In  the  present  study,  therefore,  we  examined  the 
possible  cytoprotective  effect  of  the  DNA  topo-
isomerase 
inhibitor  etoposide  on  peroxynitrite 
toxicity  in  proliferating  astrocytes.  Interestingly,  the 
present  results  demonstrates  for  the  first  time  that 
etoposide  markedly  blocks  the  augmented  toxicity 
−
of  ONOO
  in  SIN-1-treated/glucose-deprived  astro-
cytes  by  directly  scavenging  peroxynitrite,  not  by 
inhibiting  cell  cycle  progression.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Astrocyte  cultures

    Astrocytes  were  cultured  from  the  prefrontal  cor-
tices  of  2-  to  5-day-old  Sprague-Dawley  rat  pups  as 
previously  described  (Choi  and  Kim,  1998a)  In  brief, 
cells  were  dissociated  by  mild  trypsinization  (10  min 
at  37oC  with  Dulbecco's  modified  Eagle  medium 
(DMEM)  containing  0.1%  trypsin)  and  passed  th-
rough  a  sterile  nylon  sieve  (130μm  pore  size)  into 
DMEM  containing  10%  heat-inactivated  fetal  bovine 
serum  (FBS).  Cells  were  then  plated  (about  50,000 
cells/ml)  onto  poly-L-lysine  (20μg/ml)-coated  75-cm2 
culture  bottles  and  maintained  for  one  week  in 
DMEM/F12  supplemented  with  10%  FBS.  Astro-
cytes  were  then  trypsinized,  washed  and  re-plated 
in  the  growth  medium  onto  poly-L-lysine  (20μg/ 
ml)-coated  48-well  plates.  Cells  were  used  for  the 
experiments  5  to  7  days  later. 

Measurement  of  lactate  dehydrogenase

    Astrocytic  injury  and  death  was  assessed  by 
morphological  examination  of  cells  using  phase-con-
trast  microscopy  and  quantified  by  measuring  the 
amount  of  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  released 
into 
the  bathing  medium.  Activity  of  LDH  was 
measured  using  a  diagnostic  kit  (Sigma  Chemical 
Co.,  St.  Louis,  MO).  In  brief,  NADH  and  pyruvate 
(0.1  w/v  %)  were  added  and  the  samples  incubated

at  37oC  for  30  min.  The  samples  then  were  in-
cubated  with  the  coloring  reagent  for  20  min.  The 
reaction  was  stopped  by  adding  0.4  N  NaOH,  and 
the  activity  (unit/ml)  of  LDH  in  each  sample  was 
calculated  from  the  standard  curve.  Total  LDH, 
which  corresponds  to  complete  astrocyte  death, 
was  measured  in  sister  cultures  frozen  and  thawed 
after  the  experiments.  Cell  viability  was  expressed 
as  percentage  of  total  LDH. 

Determination  of  cell  cycle  distribution 

    Cells  were  washed  with  phosphate-buffered  sa-
line  (PBS),  trypsinized  and  pooled  with  the  cells 
collected  from  corresponding  suspension  at  the  end 
of  treatment.  After  washing  once  with  PBS,  cells 
were  resuspended  in  citrate  buffer  (250  mM  su-
crose,  40  mM  sodium  citrate,  pH  7.6).  Cells  were 
stained  for  30  min  in  ice-cold  DNA  staining/lysis 
buffer  (Mg2＋
-free  PBS  containing  10μg/ 
ml  RNase,  20μg/ml  propidium  iodide,  0.5%  NP-40, 
0.5  mM  EDTA,  pH  7.2).  Flow  cytometric  analysis 
was  performed  on  a  FACS  Caliber  (Becton  Dic-
kinson,  Mountain  View,  CA)  equipped  with  air- 
cooled  488  nm  argon-ion  laser.  Using  a  CELLQuest 
software  (Becton  Dickinson,  Mountain  View,  CA), 
cell  cycle  distribution  was  analysed  with  a  minimum 
of  10,000  cells.

damine  123  (DHR)  to  rhodamine  123  (RH)  was 
measured,  as  described  before  (Choi  et  al.,  2002). 
Briefly,  SIN-1  (200μM)  was  added  into  phosphate- 
buffered  saline  solution  (PBS)  containing  DHR  (10
μM)  in  the  absence  and  presence  of  etoposide. 
After  a  10  min  incubation  at  room  temperature,  the 
fluorescence  of  RH  was  measured  at  an  excitation 
wavelength  of  485  nm  and  emission  wavelength  of 
530  nm  (slit  widths  20  and  25  nm,  respectively) 
using  a 
fluorescence  microplate  reader  (FL600, 
Bio-tek  Instruments,  Inc.,  Winooski,  VT).

Measurement  of  NO

    As  previously  described  by  us  (Choi  et  al.,  2002), 
the  amount  of  NO  was  measured  with  a  com-
mercially  available  Clark-type  electrode  (ISO-NO, 
Mark  II,  World  Precision  Instruments,  Sarasota,  FL). 

92 In-Young  Choi,  et  al.

NO  is  oxidized  on  the  surface  of  a  prepolarized 
working  electrode,  permeable  only  for  gases  with 
low  molecular  weights,  resulting  in  electrical  current. 
This  current  (pA)  was  recorded  at  0.5  Hz  and 
converted  to  a  nM  concentration  of  NO  using  a 
calibration  curve  that  was  generated  daily.  NO  was 
from  200μM  S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicilla-
released 
mine  (SNAP)  by  incubation  in  PBS  containing  4 
mM  cysteine  as  a  reducing  agent  and  various  con-
centrations  of  etoposide.  All  reagents  were  freshly 
prepared  before  use.  The  formation  of  NO  was 
quantified  from  the  initial  rate  of  release  using  the 
data  acquisition  system  Duo18  (World  Precision  Ins-
truments,  Sarasota,  FL). 

Measurement  of  superoxide  anion 

    As  previously  described  by  us  (Choi  et  al.,  2002), 
the  amount  of  superoxide  anion  was  monitored  with 
a  Berthold  LB9505  luminometer  (Bad  Wildbad,  Ger-
many).  The  reaction  mixtures  contained  40  mU/ml 
xanthine  oxidase,  5μM 
lucigenin,  and  various 
concentrations  of  etoposide  in  1  ml  of  air-saturated 
PBS  (pH  10).  The  superoxide-producing  reaction 
was  initiated  by  adding  xanthine  to  yield  a  final 
concentration  of  40μM.  All  reagents  were  freshly 
prepared  in  PBS.  Chemiluminesence  was  measured 
at  1-min  intervals  for  10  min,  and  data  are  ex-
pressed  as  the  integrated  area  under  the  10-min 
curve.  Mean  blank  values  obtained  by  adding  300 
U/ml  SOD  were  subtracted  from  all  chemilumine-
scent  measurements.

Measurements  of  glutathione

then 

    For  the  measurement  of  glutathione  (GSH),  as-
trocytes  were  washed  with  PBS,  and 
in-
cubated  at  37oC  for  10  min  with  50μM  mono-
chlorobimane.  Cells  were  washed  with  PBS  and 
then  lysed  with  PBS  containing  0.2%  Triton  X-100. 
The  fluorescence  of  the  monochlorobimane-GSH 
complex  was  measured  with  a  fluorescence  mi-
croplate  reader  (FL600,  Bio-tek  Instruments,  Inc., 
Winooski,  VT)  (excitation  wavelength  of  400  nm 
and  emission  wavelength  of  480  nm).  The  GSH 
content  of  the  samples  was  calculated  from  the 
standard  curve  prepared 
from  GSH  standards 
incubated  in  the  presence  of  monochlorobimane 
and  glutathione  transferase  (Sigma  Chemical  Co., 
St.  Louis,  MO).  The  concentration  of  GSH  was 

expressed  as  nmol/mg  protein;  protein  content  was 
determined  using  the  bicinchoninic  acid  (Smith  et 
al.,  1985).

Measurement  of  hydrogen  peroxide

    Hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2)  was  measured  spec-
trophotometrically  with  some  modifications  at  550 
nm  at  37oC  by  the  peroxydase-catalysed  conversion 
of  4-aminophenazone  to  a  pink-colored  substance. 
Measurement  was  started  after  adding  reagent  to 
solution  of  various  concentrations  of  etoposide  and 
H2O2.  This  reagent  consisted  of  10  parts  of  solution 
A  [4.2  mM  3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulphonic 
acid,  dissolved  in  Mops  buffer  (50  mM  Mops/50  mM 
KCl,  pH  7.4)],  1  part  of  solution  B  (33  mM  4-amino-
phenazone)  and  2.3  units/ml  peroxydase  (final  ac-
tivity).

Statistical  analysis

    Data  are  expressed  as  the  mean±standard  error 
of  mean  (S.E.M.)  and  analysed  for  statistical  sig-
nificance  using  ANOVA  followed  by  Scheffe’s  test 
for  multiple  comparison.  A  p  value  ＜0.05  was 
considered  significant.

RESULTS

    As  we  previously  reported  (Choi  and  Kim,  1998a; 
Choi  et  al.,  2002a;  2002b),  SIN-1  potentiated  the 
LDH  release  (i.e.,  a  cell  death  marker)  in  glu-
cose-deprived  astrocytes  (Fig.  1).  Presence  of  eto-
poside  (10μM)  16  h  before  (i.e.,  pre-treatment)  and 
during  GD  (i.e.,  co-treatment)  completely  blocked 
the  potentiated  cell  death  (Fig.  1).  Similarly,  co- 
treatment  of  etoposide  alone  also  blocked  the  in-
creased  cell  death.  However,  FACS  analysis  using 
propidium  iodide  showed  that  co-treatment  of  eto-
poside  alone  did  not  arrest  the  cell  cycle  pro-
gression  (Table  1).  It  implies  that  the  cytoprotective 
effect  of  etoposide  may  not  caused  by  its  inhibition 
of  cell  cycle  progression.
    In  brain,  one  of  many  well-known  actions  of 
astrocytes  is  to  produce  antioxidants,  which  sca-
venge  reactive  oxygen  species  and  buffer  oxidative 
stress.  Astrocytes  are  known  to  be  the  main  source 
of  GSH  which  acts  as  a  free  radical  scavenger  and 
is  important  in  recycling  other  antioxidants  (Markar 
et  al.,  1994;  Ju  et  al.,  2000).  Thus,  astrocytes  ap-

perimentally  inducing  apoptosis  in  tumor  cells.  Stu-
dies  on  etoposide-induced  apoptotic  cell  death  in-
clude  the  processing  of  stabilized  cleavage  com-
plexes  into  frank  DNA  strand  breaks,  sensing  of  the 
DNA  damage,  leading  to  activation  of  stress-aso-
ciated  signaling  pathways  and  cell  cycle  arrest 
(Kubota  et  al.,  1990;  Ryan  et  al.,  1991;  Tsao  et  al., 
1992).  Etoposide  can  also  activate  a  pre-existing 
group  of  enzymes  and  enzyme  precursors,  typified 
by  the  cysteine-dependent  aspartate-directed  pro-
tease  (caspases)  (Henderson  et  al.,  2005).  The 
present  study,  however,  demonstrates 
the 
anti-tumoric  DNA  topoisomerase  II  inhibitor  etopo-
side  can  reduce  the  peroxynitrite  toxicity  in  glu-
cose-deprived  astrocytes  by  directly  scavenging  pe-
roxynitrite,  not  by  inhibiting  cell  cycle  progression.

    The  mammalian  cell  cycle  maintains 
internal 
checkpoints  at  which  cells  are  arrested  when  pre-
vious  events  have  not  been  completed  in  response 
to  external  signals  (Hartwell  and  Weinert,  1989). 
The  cell  cycle  checkpoints  are  thought  to  exist  at 
the  G1/S  and  G2/M  transitions  (Agarwal  et  al., 
1995).  Etoposide  has  been  used  as  a  potent  and 
reversible  blocker  of  the  cell  cycle  that  appears  to 
act  at  the  G2/M  transition.  Previously,  we  found  that 
the  G1/S  transition  blockers  mimosine  and  ciclo-
pirox  also  blocked  the  peroxynitrite  toxicity.  Like 
etoposide,  mimosine  reduced  the  augmented  death 
of  glucose-deprived  immunostimulated  astrocytes  by 
directly  scavenging  peroxynitrite  rather  than  sup-
pressing  the  cell  cycle  progression  (Choi  et  al., 
2002a).  Unlike  mimosine,  however,  ciclopirox  block-
ed 
in  glucose-deprived 
SIN-1-treated  astrocytes  by  attenuating  peroxyni-
trite-induced  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  not  by  sca-
venging  peroxynitrite  (Choi  et  al.,  2002b;  Lee  et  al., 
2005).  Ciclopirox  neither  prevented  the  depletion  of 
reduced  glutathione  in  glucose-deprived  SIN-1-treat-
ed  astrocytes,  nor  scavenged  oxidants  such  as 
peroxynitrite,  nitric  oxide,  superoxide  anion,  hydro-
gen  peroxide  and  hydroxyl  radical  (Choi  et  al., 
2002b).  Because  of  those  various  mechanisms  of

action,  therefore,  such  cell  cycle  inhibitors  should 
be  carefully  selected  for  the  studies  on  oxidative 
stress-related  cell  deaths.
