Kinesin-5 mechanoenzymes drive mitotic spindle dynamics as slow, processive microtubule (MT)-plus-end directed
motors. Surprisingly, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-5 Cin8 was recently found to be bi-directional: it can move
processively in both directions on MTs. Two hypotheses have been suggested for the mechanism of the directionality
switch: (1) single molecules of Cin8 are intrinsically minus-end directed, but mechanical coupling between two or more
motors triggers the switch; (2) a single motor can switch direction, and “cargo binding” i.e., binding between two MTs
triggers the switch to plus-end motility. Single-molecule fluorescence data we published recently, and augment here,
favor hypothesis (2). In low-ionic-strength conditions, single molecules of Cin8 move in both minus- and plus-end
directions. Fluorescence photo bleaching data rule out aggregation of Cin8 while they move in the plus and in the minus
direction. The evidence thus points toward cargo regulation of directionality, which is likely to be related to cargo
regulation in other kinesins. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation, however, remain to be elucidated.

Members of the kinesin-5 family of motor proteins are conserved
among eukaryotes, from yeast to humans. Among the cytoskeletal
motors, kinesins, myosins and dyneins, kinesin-5 motors are the
only ones that function as bipolar homotetramers, with two pairs
of catalytic domains located at opposite ends of
the active
complex.1,2 This special architecture is thought to enable kinesin-
5 motors to crosslink and slide apart antiparallel MTs emanating
from the opposite poles of the mitotic spindle.3 By this mode of
action, kinesin-5 motors are believed to fulfill their essential roles
in spindle dynamics such as spindle assembly, maintenance of the
bipolar spindle structure prior to the onset of anaphase,3-5 as well
as anaphase B spindle elongation.6-11 Since MTs are organized
with their plus ends overlapping in the midzone, kinesin-5 can
only push spindle poles apart during spindle assembly and elong-
ation via plus-end directed motility between antiparallel MTs.
It has indeed been demonstrated in vitro, that the vertebrate
kinesin-5 Eg5 moves simultaneously toward the plus ends of two
antiparallel MTs that it crosslinks.12,13 This finding was consistent
with the 20-year-old dogma that kinesin homologs which carry
their catalytic domains at the N-terminus are plus-end directed.14
The majority of the members of the kinesin superfamily are
plus-end directed. Minus-end motion was seen only for the
structurally distinct kinesin-14 family members which carry the
catalytic domain at their C-terminus.15-17 Being non-processive,
these motors produce isolated power strokes and can only produce

persistent motion in ensembles. Surprisingly, the S. cerevisiae
kinesin-5 Cin8 was recently found to move processively in the
minus-end direction of MTs in single-molecule fluorescence
motility assays under close-to-physiological conditions.18,19 Cin8
was shown to switch directionality to plus-end directed motility in
several experimental circumstances: in multi-motor MT gliding
assays,18,20 under low-ionic-strength conditions, and when bound
between two antiparallel MTs.18,19 Two possible mechanisms for
this switch have been suggested: one is that single molecules of
Cin8 can move only toward the minus end of MTs and that
coupling between two or more motors triggers the plus-end
directed switch;18 the second possibility is that the ability to
switch directionality is contained within a single motor itself and
that interaction between Cin8 and MTs can trigger the switch.19
Several lines of evidence support the second mechanism.

The central evidence for a motor-intrinsic switching mecha-
nism is that individual Cin8 molecules can switch to plus-end
directed motility under low-ionic-strength conditions.19 In our in
vitro single-molecule fluorescence experiments,19 low total ionic
strength below ~0.13 M (an unphysiological environment)
induced plus-end-directed and high ionic strength promoted
minus-end-directed motion of Cin8. In view of the controversy
about the mechanism of the directionality switch, it is crucial to
prove that, indeed, individual Cin8 molecules move toward the
plus ends of MTs and that observed fluorescent traces do not

originate from small clusters of motors acting collectively. To
address this point, we followed the photo-bleaching of fluorescent
Cin8-GFP tetramers, purified from S. cerevisiae cells, while they
moved on polarity-marked MTs under low-ionic-strength condi-
tions. Experiments are described in detail
in Gerson-Gurwitz
et al.19 and additional data is presented here (Fig. 1). Two buffer
conditions were examined: motility buffer (MB) with 30 mM
NaCl added (ionic strength 0.132 M) and MB with no added
NaCl (ionic strength 0.102 M). We have previously shown that
under these conditions, Cin8 moves toward the plus end of MTs
for ~60% and ~70% of the time, respectively.19 To count the
number of GFP fluorophores on each moving motor or (possibly)
motor aggregate, we measured the intensity of several single spots

in a given video recording, both for spots appearing during the
recording (i.e.,
landing from the bulk on the MT) and then
moving to the plus-end of the MT, and for spots appearing
and remaining stationary on the MT during the recording. To
obtain a scale for the intensity, i.e., to determine the intensity of
a single GFP, intensities before and after the final bleaching step
immobile motors were analyzed (Fig. 1C). The measured
of
intensity distribution was fitted with a sum of two Gaussians,
resulting in a value for the background and a value for the
intensity of a single GFP. We then measured the distribution of
the initial fluorescence intensities right after landing for both
moving and immobile motors. Intensities in a fixed area were
averaged for the first three frames (1.5 sec) right after landing

Figure 1. In low-ionic-strength conditions, single Cin8 motors move toward the plus end of MTs. (A) Kymographs of Cin8 moving away from the brightly
labeled seed marking the minus end (-) toward the plus end (+) of the MT. Kymograph in the right bottom panel was captured in MB-30; the other two
in MB-0 (exact buffer compositions are given below). Scale bars: horizontal: 10 sec; vertical: 3 mm. (B) Exemplary intensity traces of two motors landing
on a MT and moving to the MT plus end (black and red) and of a motor landing on a MT and remaining immobile (green). The traces of the moving
motors correspond to the two events shown in the left panel of (A). (C) Histogram of fluorescence intensities before and after final bleaching steps
of immobile motors, summed from a 800 nm ¾ 800 nm square of camera pixels containing the image of the motor (number of traces /motors: 8). A sum
of two Gaussians was fitted to the histogram. The first narrower peak corresponds to the background [compare also to (B)]. The broader second peak
represents the intensity of a single GFP. (D) Histogram of initial intensities of Cin8 molecules right after landing, measured in the same arbitrary units as in
(C). The intensity of the first three frames (1.5 sec) after landing was averaged for both moving and immobile motors. The histogram has a maximum
at 4 times the intensity of a single GFP [compare with (C)]. Materials and Methods: Single-molecule fluorescence assays were performed as described
in detail in Gerson-Gurwitz et al.19 In short, the custom-built total-internal-reflection-fluorescence (TIRF) microscope consisted of a 473 nm laser (Viasho,
USA) for excitation, a 100x objective (SFluor, NA 1.49, oil, Nikon, USA), and a CCD camera (Cascade 512B, Roper Scientific, USA) for detection. To observe
several colors simultaneously, the fluorescence emission signal was split by dichroic mirrors and directed to separate areas on the CCD camera.
Fluorescently Cin8-TEV-GFP-6HIS was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae and affinity purified using the his-tag and a Ni-NTA affinity column (Invitrogen, USA).
The low-salt buffers for the motility assays were composed as follows: MB-0: 50 mM Tris/HCl, 30 mM PIPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mM dithiothreitol. MB-30: the same as MB-0 but with 30 mM added NaCl. MTs were polymerized
from tissue-purified porcine tubulin, essentially as described before,31 but with Atto-488 (Atto-Tec GmbH, Siegen, Germany) labeled seeds that
also fluoresce in the green and in that way mark the minus end of the MTs.19 Kymographs were generated and analyzed with a custom-written LabView
(National Instruments, USA) routine. The fluorescence intensity emitted by single proteins was summed over an area of 5 ¾ 5 camera pixels,
corresponding to an area of 800 nm ¾ 800 nm in the specimen plane and was analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH, USA), and histograms and fits were
done with OriginPro software (OriginLab Corporation, USA).

the size of the chosen area around the spots. Comparison of initial
intensities to monomer intensities confirms that both, the motors
moving to the plus end of MTs and the stationary motors were
tetramers. Furthermore, some of the bleaching traces of Cin8
molecules that moved toward the plus ends of MTs showed four
consecutive bleaching steps (Fig. 1B), indicating again that these
molecules were tetramers with four GFP molecules. These results
demonstrate that, under low-ionic-strength conditions, individual
Cin8 molecules can move in the plus-end direction on MTs.
While coupling between multiple motors could be an additional
mechanism for switching, our results provide support for the
existence of the motor-intrinsic switch model.

this activation also occurs

Since ionic strength generally modulates electrostatic interac-
tions, the unphysiologically low-ionic-strength conditions might
mimic the effects of phosphorylation or binding of accessory
proteins or of binding geometry to the MTs. A qualitatively
similar ionic-strength effect has been reported in the context
of cargo regulation of other kinesins.13,21,22 Binding of a cargo
vesicle to kinesin-1 or of a second MT to kinesin-5 Eg5 activates
these motors, but
spontaneously
(i.e., without cargo) at low ionic strength in both cases. Tail-
head interaction is mediating this regulation in both cases. It is
thus tempting to speculate that for Cin8, cargo regulation is
also the physiological switch mechanism. In the case of Cin8, a
mechanism detecting the binding of a second MT might not just
turn the motor on or off, but lead to the observed switching of
directionality. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed plus-
end directed antiparallel sliding of MTs by Cin8 when they
entered the overlap zone between antiparallel MTs under high-
ionic-strength conditions, while motors on single MTs in the

same sample were still minus-end directed.19 Similarly,
it has
been previously demonstrated that, while the vertebrate Eg5
does neither bind to nor move on single MTs under high-ionic-
strength conditions, binding between two antiparallel MTs
activates MT sliding, driven by plus-end directed Eg5 motility.13
A similar activation effect might also occur in multi-motor MT
surface-gliding assays, in which surface-attached Cin8 was also
demonstrated to be plus-end directed.20 In MT sliding assays,
Cin8 obviously exerts force in the plus-end direction which is
reflected in the relative sliding of the MTs, but individual motors
between the coupled MTs move on rather erratic tracks such
that clear plus-end-directed periods cannot be detected.19 Cin8
behaves very differently in single-molecule fluorescence experi-
ments between parallel MTs. For the most part, motors continue
minus-end motion, apparently not interacting with the second
MT.19 The capability to distinguish relative orientation of
bound MTs
is consistent with the reported preference of
Drosophila kinesin-5 Klp61f for bundling antiparallel MTs.13
For this kinesin-5, a preferred orientation was due to the ATP-
independent binding sites in the C-terminal tails of the molecules.
A similar binding mechanism appears to also exist for Cin8
because full-length Cin8 diffusively slides along MTs in ADP
buffer.19 For Xenopus laevis kinesin-5 Eg5 it was found that all
MT binding sites in the C-terminal tails were necessary for motor
engagement between MTs.23 It still remains unclear exactly why
and how low ionic strength mimics cargo binding. Taking into
account the fact that MT attachment of the two pairs of motor
domains triggers plus-end directed motility (Fig. 2A), a speculat-
ive possibility is that under low-ionic-strength conditions, Cin8
can flex in such a way that the two pairs of catalytic domains
interact with the same MT (Fig. 2B) and thus trigger plus-end

Figure 2. Proposed model for the directionality switch of Cin8. A microtubule is sketched in light blue, with plus and minus end indicated; Cin8 is shown
in green; catalytic motor domain and coiled-coil regions are indicated in the legend. Arrows indicate the direction of movement of Cin8 on the MT
to which it is attached. (A) On a single MT, in high-ionic-strength conditions, Cin8 is minus-end directed. Binding between two antiparallel MTs activates
Cin8 to move in the plus-end directions of the MTs, causing their antiparallel sliding. (B) Under low-ionic-strength conditions on a single MT, a modified
interaction between tails and catalytic domains or flexing of the whole tetramer triggers Cin8 to move in the plus-end direction of the MT. If the tetramer
can flex enough, plus-end directed motility of single molecules of Cin8 could be triggered by binding of the two heads of Cin8 to the same MT.

low-ionic-strength conditions
could modify tail–head interactions as in kinesin-1 to trigger
plus-end directed motility.

One further piece of evidence in favor of a motor-intrinsic
mechanism for directional switching is the regulatory influence of
the 99 amino acid insert in loop 8 of the Cin8 motor domain,
deletion of which does not abolish the switch of directionality,
but shifts the switch to lower ionic strength.19 The mechanism
by which phosphorylation in the catalytic domain of Cin8
regulates its in vivo function is likely to include the modulation
of interactions with the midzone-organizing protein Ase1,8,24, or
with kinetochore proteins. The fact that a deletion construct
(Cin8D99) and a loop 8 Cdk1 phosphorylation-deficient con-
struct (Cin8-2A) exhibit reduced motility toward the midzone in
vivo,19 suggests that one of the roles of Cin8 phosphorylation in
the 99aa insert is to mediate the switch to plus-end directed
motility of Cin8 on the mitotic spindle.

The question remains how its exceptional motile properties
aid Cin8 in performing its roles in mitosis. One can speculate
on the basis of the localization of Cin8 in the various stages of
mitosis. The ionic strength in S. cerevisiae cells is ~300 mM
salt.25,26 At this ionic strength, Cin8 is minus-end directed in
vitro.19 Before spindle elongation in anaphase, Cin8 is known to

be involved in the positioning of the chromosome kinetochores
near the spindle pole bodies.27-29 Cin8 could function at that
stage by crosslinking of kinetochore MTs (kMTs)27 and by aiding
the disassembly of long kMTs.30 Since in S. cerevisiae cells each
kinetochore is attached to the plus end of a single MT, motion
of Cin8 in the minus-end direction of the kMTs might be a part
of kinetochore positioning. Cin8 also shows plus-end directed
motility in vivo in anaphase spindles,19 even on single MTs or on
parallel MT bundles, which implies a further mode of regulation
not seen in the in vitro experiments. Regulated bi-directional
motility might be important to distribute Cin8 motors between
the different locations where they are known to accumulate, i.e.,
near the spindle poles and in the midzone.

is

In summary, Cin8 has

rather unexpectedly extended the
spectrum of known kinesin capabilities. It is the first known
kinesin that
truly bi-directional and processive in both
directions. Found in a low eukaryote, this function might have
evolved early and might have been lost in higher eukaryotes.
The exact molecular mechanism remains to be clarified, but
seems likely to be related to cargo switching known for other
kinesins. Our results indicate a role of electrostatic interactions
and possibly phosphorylation, and, most importantly, binding
geometry between pairs of MTs.
