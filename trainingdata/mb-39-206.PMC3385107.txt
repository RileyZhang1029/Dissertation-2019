(Received  July  4,  2011.  Accepted  August  20,  2011)

The  seed-borne  mycoflora  of  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  collected  from  different  growing  areas  in  South  Korea  were  isolated
and  taxonomically  identified  using  dry  inspection,  standard  blotter  and  the  agar  plate  method.  We  investigated  the  in  vitro
and  in  vivo  germination  rates  of  disinfected  and  non-disinfected  seeds  of  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  using  sterilized  and
unsterilized soil. The percent recovery of  seed-borne mycoflora from the seed components of sorghum and foxtail millet seeds
was  determined  and  an  infection  experiment  using  the  dominant  species  was  evaluated  for  seedling  emergence  and  mortality.
A  higher  number  of  seed-borne  fungi  was  observed  in  sorghum  compared  to  that  of  foxtail  millet.  Eighteen  fungal  genera
with  34  fungal  species  were  identified  from  the  seeds  of  sorghum  and  13  genera  with  22  species  were  identified  from  the
seeds  of  foxtail  millet.  Five  dominant  species  such  as  Alternaria  alternata,  Aspergillus  flavus,  Curvularia  lunata,  Fusarium
moniliforme  and  Phoma  sp.  were  recorded  as  seed-borne  mycoflora  in  sorghum  and  4  dominant  species  (Alternaria  alternata,
Aspergillus  flavus,  Curvularia  lunata,  Fusarium  moniliforme)  were  observed  in  foxtail  millet.  The  in  vitro  and  in  vivo
germination  rates  were  higher  using  disinfected  seeds  and  sterilized  soil.  More  seed-borne  fungi  were  recovered  from  the
pericarp  compared  to  the  endosperm  and  seed  embryo.  The  percent  recovery  of  seed-borne  fungi  ranged  from  2.22%  to
60.0%,  and  Alternaria  alternata,  Curvularia  lunata  and  4  species  of  Fusarium  were  isolated  from  the  endosperm  and  embryo
of  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet.  Inoculation  of  the  dominant  seed-borne  fungi  showed  considerable  mortality  of  seedlings.  All
the  transmitted  seed-borne  fungi  might  well  be  a  primary  source  of  infection  of  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  crops.

Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and foxtail millet
[Setaria  italica  (L.)  P.  Beauv.]  are  commonly  cultivated
cereal  crops  and  they  form  a  substantial  part  of  the
farming  system  for  people  living  in  Asia  [1].  Foxtail
millet  ranks  second  in  the  world’s  total  production  of
millets  [2]  and  it  is  used  as  human  food  in  Korea,  which
produced  about  1,851 t  of  this  in  2001  [3].  It  is  also
cultivated  for  emergency  purposes  and  it  is  widely
consumed due to its ability to compensate for the nutrient
deficiencies  of  rice  such  as  the  lack  of  vitamins  and
minerals  [1].  In  Korea,  functional  products  derived  from
millets and sorghums have a great potential as therapeutic
agents  [4,  5].  In  fact,  there  are  some  reports  on  the  anti-
microbial  [6, 7]  and  anti-carcinogenic  [4, 8]  effects  of
sorghum,  whereas  millets  have  an  anti-diabetes  action  by
improving the cholesterol metabolism of the body [9, 10].
In Asia and Africa, the annual economic loss due to grain
mold  is  more  than  US$130  million  [11].  Grain  yields  are
relatively  low  due  to  insect  pests  and  diseases  [12-15].
The  Korean  climate  have  distinct  four  seasons  and  the

harvesting  time  of  sorghum  and  millet  is  usually  during
the  late  part  of  September  or  the  early  part  of  October
(the  fall  season).  At  this  time,  seeds  are  vulnerable  to
attack  by  mold  fungi.  Several  reports  about  seed-borne
mycoflora  on  sorghum  [16, 17]  and  foxtail  millet  have
been published. Post-harvest fungal infection, according to
farmers,  has  been  one  of  the  constraints  for  mass
production of these grains. Most of the literature on fungal
pathogens  of  millets  and  sorghum  is  derived  from  India
and eastern Africa. There is a lack of quantitative information
on  the  disease  prevalence  and  on  the  level  of  disease
severity in the grain producing regions of Southern Korea.
Preliminary research on the constraints of millet and sorghum
production  and  the  subsequent  reviews  do  not  provide
quantitative values or information on the disease prevalence
or  severity,  nor  have  there  been  any  studies  that  have
examined  the  relationship  between  disease  severity  and
the  different  agro-ecological  locations  in  Southern  Korea.
Such  knowledge  gaps  have  hindered  efforts  to  assess  the
true economic importance of diseases of millet and sorghum

in Southern Korea. An accurate assessment of the relative
importance  of  millet  and  sorghum  diseases  is  needed  in
order  to  help  target  research  priorities  and  justify  the  use
of  resources.  We  report  here  on 
the  most  recent
assessment  of  the  seed-borne  mycoflora  from  sorghum
and  foxtail  millet  that  was  collected  from  five  different
growing  areas  in  Southern  Korea.  We  also  investigated
and compared the in vitro and in vivo germination rates of
disinfected  and  non-disinfected  seeds  of  sorghum  and
foxtail millet, with using sterilized and unsterilized soil, to
determine  the  recovery  of  seed-borne  mycoflora  from
different  seed  components  of  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet
seeds. We also evaluated the effect of seed-borne inoculums
of  the  main  fungi  on  seedling  emergence,  seedlings
mortality and transmission.

Materials  and  Methods

The  experiment  was  conducted  at  the  Plant  Pathology
Laboratory  of  National  Institute  of  Crop  Science  (NICS),
Rural Development Administration (RDA), Miryang, Korea.
The fungi associated with sorghum and foxtail millet seeds
were  detected  by  using  seed  health  testing  methods.  The
seeds  that  were  characteristic  of  five  different  seed  sources
derived from sorghum and foxtail millet growing areas in
Southern  Korea  were  used  in  this  study  (Table  1).  The
seeds  were  collected  in  September  2010  and  they  were
stored  in  a  standard  storage  room  at  the  Plant  Breeding
Division of NICS, RDA, Korea. After one year of storage,
seed  viability  tests  were  conducted  under  both  in  in  vitro
and in vivo conditions by comparing the germination rates
of  disinfected  and  non-disinfected  seeds  of  sorghum  and
foxtail  millet  and  we  investigated  the  effect  of  different
mycoflora associated with the seeds prior to seed sowing.

Seed  health  testing  methods. Three  conventional  seed
health testing methods as reported by Mathur and Kongsdal
[18]  were  used  to  detect  the  mycoflora  associated  with
sorghum and foxtail millet seeds. Dry inspection methods
were  used  in  the  study  to  detect  sclerotia  of  ergot  in  the
seed  samples.  One  hundred  grams  each  of  the  foxtail

millet  and  sorghum  seeds  were  used  for  visual  inspection
using  a  stereo  microscope.  The  standard  blotter  method
was  used  to  detect  a  wide  range  of  fungi  that  are  able  to
easily  arise  from  seeds  in  the  presence  of  humidity.  Four
hundred  untreated  pure  seeds  from  each  samples  were
plated  on  moisten  blotters  (Whatman  No.  1)  in  a  9 cm
diameter plastic Petri dish at the rate of 300 seeds per dish
and the seeds were incubated for 7 days at 20~25oC under
alternating  cycles  of  12 hr  near  ultraviolet  light  and  12 hr
darkness.  Individual  seeds  were  examined  under  a
stereomicroscope  for  the  presence  and  absence  of  fungi.
Identification was confirmed by examining for the presence
of mycelium and/or conidia under a compound microscope.
The  fungal  species  present  on  each  of  the  seeds  were
recorded  and  the  percent  incidence  of  each  fungus  per
sample  was  computed.  The  washing  test  was  used  to
detect  teliospores  of  smut  and  oospores  that  were  present
on  the  surface  of  the  seeds.  Sorghum  seeds  (5 g)  and
foxtail millet seeds (10 g) were shaken in 25 mL of distilled
water.  The  suspension  was  centrifuged  at  3,000 rpm  for
5 min.  The  sediment  was  suspended  in  1 mL  of  distilled
water  and  then  it  was  examined  under  a  compound
microscope.  The  agar  plate  method  was  used  to  further
characterize  the  fungal  growth  that  was  observed  in  the
plate.  A  mix  culture  was  re-isolated  into  pure  cultures
using  potato  dextrose  agar  as  a  medium.  After  seven  days
of  incubation,  detailed  examination  was  done  by  preparing
semi-permanent  slides  and  examining  them  under  a
compound microscope.

Germination test.
In vitro germination rate tests for the
disinfected  and  non-disinfected  seeds  were  conducted  in
order to determine the effect of mycoflora associated with
the seeds. Disinfected seeds were treated with 1% sodium
hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  solution  and  no  treatment  was
applied  for  the  non-disinfected  seeds.  There  were  two
separate  methods  of  testing  the  germination  of  sorghum
and  foxtail  millet.  The  ‘between  paper’  method  was  used
for testing the viability of sorghum seeds. The seeds were
germinated  between  two  layers  of  moist  paper  towels.
The seeds were arranged in rows at regular intervals 4 cm

from  the  top  edge  and  with  leaving  a  3~4 cm  gap  on  the
sides.  The  seeds  were  covered  with  another  sheet  of  dry
paper  towel.  The  paper  was  loosely  rolled  and  a  paper
clip was used to hold the rolled paper towels from falling
apart. The tray containing the rolls was incubated at 20oC
for 4 days. Foxtail millet seeds were germinated on a top
moist  paper  (Whatman  Grade  181)  in  a  9 cm  diameter
petri  dish.  Each  plate  was  moistened  with  4 mL  of
distilled  water.  Fifty  seeds  in  each  plate  were  spread  at  a
regular  distance  on  the  surface  of  the  paper.  The  petri
dishes  were  covered  with  a  plastic  bag  to  prevent  drying
and  they  were  incubated  at  20oC  for  4  days.  Germination
was  considered  present  when  the  radical  protrudes  by  2~
4 mm.  The  percent  of  germination  of  sorghum  and  foxtail
millet was calculated and recorded after 24 hr. The effect of
seed-borne  mycoflora  on  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  seeds
was  also  tested  in  vivo.  A  completely  randomized  design
with  three  replications  was  used  in  this  study.  The
germination  rate  was  tested  using  disinfected  and  non-
disinfected  sorghum  seeds  and  foxtail  millet  seeds.  Two
types  of  soil  were  used  in  the  study:  sterilized  and
unsterilized  cocopeat  soil.  Five  different  seed  sources  were
used in the experiment. Five hundred seeds of sorghum and
foxtail  millet  per  replicate  were  sown  in  plastic  trays  and
the  percent  germination  was  recorded  7  days  after  sowing.
Three  consecutive  trials  were  conducted  to  determine  the
effects of disinfection of seeds and sterilization of soil.

Component  plating  test. Forty  five  seeds  per  sample
were  used  for  detecting  the  mycoflora  associated  with
different  components  of  the  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet
seeds.  Seed samples  were  soaked in  sterile  distilled  water
in 9 cm diameter Petri dishes for 24 hr. Prior to separation
of  different  seed  components,  the  seeds  were  disinfected
with 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 5 min and then
they  were  washed  three  times  with  distilled  water.  The
seeds  were  allowed  to  air  dry  for  1 hr  under  a  laminar
flowhood. The soaked seeds were dissected using a sterile
scalpel  under  a  stereomicroscope  and  they  were  separated
into  three  parts;  pericarp,  endosperm  and  embryo.  Potato
carrot  agar  was  used  as  a  medium  for  initiating  fungal
growth  from  the  different  seed  components.  The  petri
dishes  were  incubated  for  7  days  in  the  same  way  as  the
blotter  method  using  alternating  cycles  of  12 hr  NUV
light  and  12 hr  darkness.  The  fungi  on  the  different  seed
components were observed under a stereo microscope and
a  compound  microscope  for  identification.  Identification
of  fungi  was  carried  out  based  on  the  morphological
characteristics described by previous studies [18-24].

Seedling emergence and mortality and the evaluation of
seed-to-seedling  transmission  The  effects  of  the  fungi
isolated  from  the  incubated  seeds  of  sorghum  and  foxtail
millet were tested on the seedling emergence and seedling
mortality.  One  hundred  fifty  seeds  of  the  sorghum  and

foxtail millet that were previously disinfected in 70% ethanol
for  5 min  were  used.  The  seeds  were  inoculated  by
immersing the seeds in a standardized solution containing
spores  at  a  concentration  of  1 × 106 spores/mL  of  the  five
dominant  species  isolated  from  the  blotter  test  and  the
agar  plate  method.  A  haemacytometer  was  used  for
determining  the  quantity  of  spores  per  mL.  The  seeds
were  sown  in  a  plastic  pot  (25 seeds  per  pot)  containing
sterilized  soil  and  by  following  the  procedure  used  by
Mathur et al. [25]. The pots were kept in a growing room
for 10 days under 12 hr fluorescent light/12 hr darkness at
25~ 29oC. Untreated seeds, seeds disinfected with ethanol
and  seeds  treated  with  a  chemical  called  calthio  (20%
Lindane, 25% Thirame) were used as controls. A completely
randomized  design  was  used  with  three  replications.  Ten
days  after  sowing,  the  seedlings’  emergence  and  the
seedlings’  mortality  were  evaluated  and  the  percent  of
emerged  seedlings  and  the  percent  of  dead  seedling  were
calculated.  To  evaluate  seed-to-seedling  transmission  of
the  fungi,  ten  seedlings  from  each  treatment  were  cut  at
the level of the coleoptiles, disinfected in 70% ethanol for
2 min  and  plated  on  moistened  blotter  papers  in  a  plastic
box  for  5  days.  The  plants  infected  by  the  target  fungus
were counted using a stereomicroscope and the result was
expressed  as  a  percent.  The  severity  of  infection  (the
capacity  of  the  fungus  to  propagate  inside  the  seedling)
was  estimated  for  the  incubated  seedlings  by  assigning  a
score  based  on  the  presence  or  absence  of  the  fungus  in
the plant parts: score 1 is for healthy plants, score 2 is for
slightly infected plants (fungus present on the plant stem)
and  score  3  is  for  highly  infected  plants  (fungus  present
on the plant stem and/or leaves). An index of severity was
calculated  following  the  formula  used  by  Williams  and
Singh [26] and the result was expressed as a percent:

S (%) = {Σ(xi − 1)/[E(xi) − 1] × N} × 100

Where:
Xi = Note attributed to each plant from class I
Ni = Number of plants from class I
E(x) = Range of the scale of notation (3)
N = Total number of observed seedlings (10)
S = Severity  of  infection  or  the  capacity  of  the  fungus  to
invade  the  plant  (%).  The  percents  of  the  severity  of
infection  were  transformed  into  Arcsine  values  before
performing the statistical analysis

Data  analysis. The  main  seed-borne  fungi  of  sorghum
and foxtail millet, the effect of fungi on seedlings, seedling
emergence and seedling mortality and  the main  pathogenic
and  seed-transmitted  fungi  were  determined  by  analysis  of
variance (ANOVA) using a completely randomized design.
The significance (p < 0.05) of differences between treatments
were determined using the Duncan’s multiple ranged test of
SAS ver. 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results

Seed-borne  mycoflora  of  the  sorghum  and  foxtail
millet. The  assessment  of  seed-borne  mycoflora  revealed
that more seed-borne fungi were recovered from sorghum

as  compared  to  that  of  foxtail  millet.  The  occurrence  of
seed-borne mycoflora also varied between locations where
out of the five growing areas of sorghum, Sinan, Jeonnam
Province  (34  fungal  species)  and  Goesan,  Chungbuk
Province (33 fungal species) recorded the highest number of

Phoma  sp.,  P.  notatum,  R.  oryzae,  S.  reliana,  S.  sorghi,
and C. sorghi. The percent of seeds infected by mycoflora
from  the  seeds  collected  from  Sinan,  Jeonnam  Province
ranged  from  80.67%  to  89.00%. The  five  dominant  seed-
borne  fungi  were  A.  alternata,  F.  solani,  C.  lunata,  F.
pallidoroseum,  and  F.  equisetti.  In  Goesan,  Chungbuk
Province,  the  range  of  percent  infection  was  77.67%  to
89.67%  and  the  five  dominant  seed-borne  fungi  were  F.
solani,  A.  alternata,  C.  lunata,  F.  pallidoroseum,  and  C.
oryzae. A low percent of seed-borne infection was observed
for  Wonju,  Gangwon  Province.  The  highest  value  of
infection ranged from 16.33% to only 22.00%. A. alternata
recorded  the  highest  percent  infection  followed  by  A.
niger, A. flavus, and A. vesicolor. The top 4 most dominant
seed-borne  fungi  in  Miryang,  Gyeongnam  Province  were
F.  solani,  F.  pallidoroseum, A. flavus and A. nidulans.  The
percent  of  infected  seeds  was  12.00%  to  83.33%,  which
was  lower  compared  to  the  percent  of  infected  seeds
observed  for  seeds  from  Sinan,  Jeonnam  and  Goesan,
Chungbuk provinces. About 3.00% to 6.33% of the seeds
were  infected  with  seed-borne  mycoflora  from  the  seed
from Gochang, Jeonbuk Province and there were 4 fungal
seed-borne  mycoflora:  A.  alternata,  F.  moniliforme,  C.
lunata and A. flavus.

Comparison  of  the  in  vitro  percent  germination  of  the
disinfected  and  non-disinfected  seeds  of  sorghum  and
foxtail  millet. Significant  differences  were  observed
depending  on  the  types  of  treatment  the  seeds  received
prior to germination as well as the percent germination of
the  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  collected  from  different
growing areas of Southern Korea (Figs. 1 and 2). Sorghum
and  foxtail  millet  seeds  disinfected  with  1%  NaOCl  had

higher  germination  rates  compared  to  the  non-disinfected
seeds.  The  percent  of  germination  of  the  collected  seeds
from  different  growing  areas  in  Southern  Korea  showed
significant  differences.  Sorghum  seeds  collected  from
Gochang,  Jeonbuk  Province  had  the  highest  percent
germination (93.17%) followed by the seeds collected from
Miryang,  Gyeongnam  Province  (84.77%),  Wonju,  Gangwon
Province  (84.17%)  and  Goesan,  Chungbuk  Province
(76.67%),  and  the  seeds  from  Sinan,  Jeonnam  Province
(39.83%)  had  the  lowest  germination  rate.  The  germination
rate  of  foxtail  millet  seeds  from  Gochang,  Jeonbuk
Province  had  the  highest  germination  value  (99.84%)
followed  by  Miryang,  Gyeongnam  Province,  Wonju,
Gangwon  Province,  Sinan,  Jeonnam  Province  and  Goesan,
Chungbuk  Province  with  germination  rates  of  96.84%,
92.84%, 87.67%, and 86.17%, respectively.

Comparison  of  the  in  vivo  percent  germination  of  the
disinfected  and  undisinfected  seeds  of  sorghum  and
foxtail millet sown in sterilized and unsterilized soil.
In
vivo  germination  was  conducted  to  compare  the  effect  of
treating  the  seeds  prior  to  seed  sowing  and  the  effect  of
using  sterilized  and  unsterilized  soil.  The  results  of  the
experiment  showed  that  significant  differences  of  the
germination  rate  of  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  were
observed  by  treating  the  seeds  and  by  using  2  types  of
soil  (sterilized  or  unsterilized).  Using  2  types  of  soil  and
treating the seeds prior  to  seed sowing had  a direct effect
on  the  germination  rate.  The  germination  rates  of  the
sorghum and foxtail millet seeds were significantly higher
for the disinfected seeds and using sterilized soil compared
to that of non-disinfected seeds and using unsterilized soil
(Figs.  3  and  4).  Disinfected  or  undisinfected  sorghum
seeds sown in sterilized soil and that were collected from
Gochang,  Jeonbuk  Province  had  the  highest  germination
rate  (96.33%  to  97.00%)  and  the  germination  rate  was
significantly  reduced  when  disinfected  or  non-disinfected

sorghum  seeds  were  sown  in  unsterilized  soil  (91.67%  to
94.67%  respectively). Comparable germination  rates were
observed for the disinfected or undisinfected sorghum seeds
from  Miryang,  Gyeongnam  Province,  Wonju,  Gangwon
Province  and  Goesan,  Chungbuk  Province  with  of  values
of 83.33% to 87.00%, 79.30% to 81.00%, and 70.33% to
79%,  respectively.  There  was  an  abrupt  decrease  of  the
germination  rate  of  the  sorghum  collected  from  Sinan,
Jeonnam  Province.  The  germination  rate  ranged  from
36.33% to 38.33% using either disinfected or non-disinfected
seeds  sown  in  sterilized  or  unsterilized  soil  (Fig.  3A  and
3B).  The  results  indicated  that  the  germination  rate  of
foxtail  millet  using  disinfected  seeds  and  sterilized  soil
was better compared to that of non-disinfected seeds sown
in  unsterilized  soil,  yet  a  however  higher  percent  of
germination  was  observed  for  foxtail  millet  compared  to
the  germination  rate  derived  from  sorghum.  The  range  of

germination  of  foxtail  millet  was  70.33%  to  97%.  The
germination  performance  of  the  seeds  collected  from
Gochang, Jeonbuk Province had the highest value (94.33%
to 97%) followed by Miryang, Gyeongnam, Sinan, Jeonnam,
Wonju,  Gangwon  and  Goesan,  Chungbuk  provinces  with
values of 84.33% to 87.00%,  82.67% to 86.00%,  79.67%
to 87%, and 70.33% to 80.67%, respectively.

Percent recovery of seed-borne mycoflora from sorghum
and  foxtail  millet  from  the  different  seed  components.
Significant variation was  observed  in  terms  of  seed-borne
fungal  recovery  from  the  different  seed  components.
There  was  a  significant  difference  of  percent  of  fungi
recovered  between  the  locations  where  the  seeds  were
collected.  Generally,  more  fungal  species  were  recovered
from the pericarp of both sorghum and foxtail millet than
from  the  endosperm  and  embryo  (Table  4).  Seed  samples

collected  from  Sinan,  Jeonnam  Province  exhibited  the
greatest seed-borne recovered fungi (66.67%) followed by
Goesan, Chungbuk (46.67%), Miryang, Gyeongnam (37.78%),
Wonju,  Gangwon  (33.33%)  and  Gochang,  Jeonbuk
provinces  (26.67%).  The  fungal  growth  isolated  from  the
endosperm  ranged  from  0%  to  60%,  while  that  from  the
sorghum embryos ranged from 0% to 28.89%. The fungal
growth  from  foxtail  millet  ranged  was  from  28.44%  to
64.44%, while that from the foxtail millet endosperm and
embryo  ranged  from  0%  to  33.33%  and  0%  to  4.45%,
respectively.  Fifteen  fungal  species  were  recovered  and
identified  from  the  pericarp  of  sorghum  seeds  (Table  5).
The identified species were A. longissima, A. alternata, A.
flavus,  A.  niger,  C.  lunata,  C.  oryzae,  F.  moniliforme,  F.
pallidoroseum,  F.  equisetti,  F.  solani,  F.  subglutinans,
Nigrospora  oryzae,  P.  notatum,  and  B.  sorghicola.  From
the fifteen fungal species isolated from the pericarp, seven
species  were  further  colonized  from  the  endosperm  and
these  were  A.  alternata,  C.  lunata,  F.  moniliforme,  F.
pallidoroseum,  F.  equisetti,  F.  solani,  and  F.  subglutinans.
The  five  fungal  species  from  the  embryo  were  A.
alternata, F. moniliforme, F. pallidoroseum, F. equisetti, F.
solani,  and  F.  subglutinans  (Table  4).  Only  five  fungal
species were recovered from the pericarp  of foxtail millet
(A.  alternata,  C.  lunata,  F.  solani,  F.  equisetti,  and  A.
niger), three species were isolated from the endosperm of
foxtail millet (A. alternata, F. solani, and F. equisetti) and

F.  solani  was  the  only  species  isolated  from  the  seed
embryo of foxtail millet.

Seedling  emergence  and  mortality  and  evaluation  of
seed-to-seedling  transmission. Significant  differences
were  observed  for  seedling  emergence  of  sorghum  as
affected  by  inoculation  of  different  seed-borne  fungal
organisms (Table 6). Untreated seeds (T1), seeds disinfected
with 1% NaOCl (T2) and seeds disinfected with Prochloraz
(T3)  showed  100%  germination.  The  percent  of  seedling
emergence was significantly affected by the inoculation of
the  four  dominant  seed-borne  fungi.  Inoculation  of  F.
moniliforme  (T6)  exhibited  the  highest  reduction  of  seedling
emergence  (76.67%)  followed  by  F.  solani  (T7)  and  A.
alternata  (T4)  (81.67%  respectively)  and  that  for  the
seedling  emergence  of  C.  lunata  was  90.0%  (T5).  The
percentage  of  dead  seedlings  10  days  after  inoculation
was also significantly differently different according to the
four dominant seed-borne fungi that were inoculated. The
percent of dead seedlings ranged from 23.33% to 41.67%.
Inoculation with F. solani (T7) had the highest percentage
of  dead  seedlings  10  days  after  inoculation  (41.67%)

comparable  with  each  other  and  the  ranged  of  dead
seedlings  were  from  0~5%.  The  percentage  of  infected
seedlings  10  days  after  inoculation  was  also  significantly
different.  All  the  plants  inoculated  with  seed-borne  fungi
exhibited  variable  degrees  of  infection.  The  value  of
infection  ranged  from  10  to  23.33%  in  which  F.  solani
(T7)  and  A.  alternata  (T5)  recorded  the  highest  rate  of
infected  seedlings  at  20.0  to  23.33%,  respectively.  Zero
percent of infected seedlings were observed in T2 and T3.
The  percent  index  of  severity  ranged  from  23.67%  to
31.0% with the plants inoculated with F. solani having the
highest  percentage  of  severity  index.  Zero  index  of
severity was observed on seeds in T2 and T3 respectively.
The  percent  of  seedling  emergence  was  significantly
lower  for  foxtail  millet  as  compared  to  that  of  sorghum.
The  percentage  of  seedling  emergence  ranged  from  60%
to  77.78%  and  the  plants  treated  with  F.  solani  exhibited
the  highest  seedling  emergence  rate.  A  comparable  effect
was observed for the plants treated with A. alternata (T4)
and  C.  lunata  (T5)  with  60%  seedling  emergence,
respectively.  Untreated  seeds  (T1),  seeds  treated  with  1%
NaOCl (T2) and seeds treated with chemical control (T3)
had  100%  seedling  emergence.  The  percentage  of  dead
seedlings 10 days after inoculation ranged from 24.45% to
51.11%  and  the  plants  inoculated  with  F.  solani  (T7)  had
the  highest  percentage  of  dead  seedlings.  The  percent  of
infected  seedlings  10  days  after  inoculation  was  also
significantly  different.  The  plant  inoculated  with  F.  solani
(T7) had 31.11% infected seedlings followed by comparable
effects  of  F.  moniliforme  (T6)  and  A.  alternata  (T4)  at
15.55%  and  13.33%  respectively.  The  index  of  severity
ranged  from  24.0%  to  31.0%.  The  plants  inoculated  with
F. solani (T7) and A. alternata (T4) had the highest index
of  severity  (31.0%,  respectively).  A  comparable  effect

was  observed  for  the  untreated  seeds  (T1),  the  seeds
treated  with  1%  NaOCl  (T2)  and  the  chemical  control
(T3).  The  index  of  severity  from  these  treatments  ranged
from 0 to 2%.

Discussion

Good seed must have a high germination rate and be free
of seed-borne pathogens and good seeds are recognized as
an  important  input  in  any  agricultural  production  system
[27]. The presence of seed-borne mycoflora and the effect
of seed-borne fungi on germination and disease transmission
are important factors in determining the reaction of sorghum
and foxtail millet to grain mold [28-32]. This study is the
most  updated  assessment  of  seed-borne  mycoflora  on
stored  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  in  different  growing
areas  of  the  southern  part  of  Korea.  The  assessment  of
seed-borne mycoflora revealed that more seed-borne fungi
were recovered from sorghum compared to that of foxtail
millet  (Tables  1  and  2).  Mycological  analysis  of  seeds
naturally  infected  with  grain  mold  showed  that  34  fungal
species  of  seed-borne  fungi  were  observed  on  sorghum
and  only  24  fungal  species  were  isolated  from  foxtail
millet.  The  most  dominant  fungal  species  that  were
isolated  from  five  growing  areas  of  sorghum  were  A.
alternata, A. flavus, C. lunata, F. moniliforme, and Phoma
sp. These fungi heavily infected both sorghum and foxtail
millet.  The  findings  of  our  study  coincided  with  the  data
obtained  from  India,  [17, 33-35],  Bangladesh [36], Burkina
Faso [27], Nigeria [37], Pakistan [38], and the USA [16].
The high frequency of occurrence of the above organisms
was also observed in the previous surveys done by Mathur
et al. [39] and Tarp et al. [40]. These five dominant species
were  aggressive  in  causing  grain  mold  on  sorghum  and

foxtail  millet.  Hepperly  et  al.  [41]  identified  F.  moniliforme,
C.  lunata,  and  Alternaria  spp.  as  the  most  frequently
recovered fungal species from natural grain mold-infected
seed. F. moniliforme has been shown to be comprised of a
number  of  Fusarium  species.  This  would  suggest  that  the
five dominant species would be the most important fungal
species for evaluating sorghum and foxtail millet germplasm
for resistance to grain mold in South Korea. The occurrence
of  all  the  major  fungi  in  both  sorghum  and  foxtail  millet
seeds  from  South  Korea  could  be  related  to  the  large
number of seed samples coming from this agro-ecological
zone.  In  addition,  the  total  production  is  higher  (data  not
shown)  and  the  climate  is  more  favorable  for  fungal
colonization  in  Sinan  and  Goesan  provinces.  The  high
infection  of  seed-borne  fungi  in  sorghum  could  be
attributed  to  the  starch  component  of  the  seeds  compared
to  the  starch  component  of  millet.  The  average  starch
content of sorghum is 69.5%, while that of millet is from
56.3%  to  63.7%  [42].  The  grain  hardness  is  other  factor
that  may  contribute  to  fungal  infection  as  foxtail  millet  is
harder  compared  to  sorghum.  Grain  hardness  has  been
implicated  in  reducing  mold  infestation  [43-47].  Harder
grains have lower mold infection compared to softer grains
[48].  Many  of  the  same  factors  that  contribute  to  varietal
differences  of  resistance  to  fungal  infection  are  responsible
for the varietal differences of resistance [49].

The  in  vitro  germination  rate  was  comparable  between
the  disinfected  and  non-disinfected  seeds.  This  study
indicated  that  disinfection  with  hypochlorite  could  not  be
a  guarantee  that  all  microorganisms  will  be  killed.  The
use  of  hypochlorite  serves  as  surface  disinfection  where
advance penetration of fungus to deeper layer of the cells
prior  to germination  would not  be  suppressed,  which  was
also  confirmed  by  Melchers  [50].  The  low  germination
rate was due to the presence of microorganisms that affect
the  growth  of  newly  emerging  shoots.  It  was  observed
that  germination  occurred,  but  the  fungal  growth  was
faster.  It  means  that  there  was  an  existing  source  of
inoculums  in  the  seeds,  which  will  inhibit  germination.
The use of sodium hypochlorite helped in minimizing the
incidence of  superficial  and  fast growing  fungi as  well as
common seed borne fungi like Aspergillus spp., Chaetomium
spp., Cladosporium spp., Rhizopus spp., and Cephalosporium
spp.  Similar  results  were  also  obtained  by  Dawar  and
Ghaffar  [51]  for  sunflower  seeds.  Surface  disinfection  of
seed with 1% Na(OCl)2 reduced the incidence of Aspergillus
spp. However, other slow growing deep seated seed borne
fungi  like  Curvularia  spp.,  Drechslera  spp.,  Fusarium
spp.,  Botryodiplodia 
theobromae,  and  Macrophomina
phaseolina  were  detected  at  greater  frequencies.  These
results  are  similar  with  the  findings  of  Limonard  [52].
Mycological  analysis  of  disinfected  and  non-disinfected
seeds  gave  only  general  information  about  inner  seed
infection,  with  assuming  that  fungi  is  present  in  non-

disinfected  seeds  and  absent  in  disinfected  seeds  and  that
the fungi were contaminated their surface and they did  not
penetrate  the  inner  tissues.  This  information,  although  not
very  precise,  can  be  a  starting  point  to  determine  proper
strategies of seed treatment.

In  vivo  experiment  study  proved  that  disinfected  seeds
using  sterilized  soil  had  a  higher  germination  rate.  This
could  be  due  to  the  effect  of  disinfection  and  sterilization
of  the  soil  substrate  used  in  the  nursery.  There  are  fungi
that  are  only  saprophytic  in  nature  and  that  could  easily
be  removed  by  disinfection,  yet  there  also  seed-borne
fungi  that  could  penetrate  the  inner  layer  of  the  seeds.
Hence,  fungal  organism  that  infect  the  endosperm  and
embryo  usually  do  this  during  the  seedling  stage.  The
sterilized  seeds  showed  a  lesser  population  of  seed-borne
fungi than did the unsterilized seeds and this is agreement
with  the  data  of  Limonard  [53],  who  reported  that
disinfection  effectively  reduced  the  microbial  contamination.
Surface sterilization also has the advantage of minimizing
competition  among  fungi  on  the  seed  [54].  Seed  surface
disinfection  with  HgCl2  usually  suppresses  the  growth  of
saprophytic  fungi  and  other  superficial  fast  growing  fungi
[51, 55].  It  was  also  observed  by  Ramakrishna  et  al.  [56]
that  surface  sterilization  with  0.1  or  2.0  (w/v)  HgCl2  for
3 min  significantly  decreased  A.  alternata,  Fusarium  sp.,
and  Epicoccum  purpurascens  infection,  but  Niaz  and
Dawar [57] observed that surface disinfection of seed with
1%  Na(OCl)2  reduced  the  incidence  of  Aspergillus  spp.,
Chaetomium  spp.,  Rhizopus  spp.,  and  Cephalosporium
spp.  Reduction  of  the  frequency  of  fungi  from  sterilized
sunflower  seeds  was  also  found  by  Sharfun-Nahar  and
Hashmi [58] and Bhutta [55]. At the beginning  of  storage,
some  of  the  fungi  that  infected  the  seeds  were  classified
as  field  fungi  and  their  population  decreased  with  the
increase of the storage duration [59, 60]. A clear result of
the  current  study  indicated  that  there  was  an  increase
germination  rate  in  sterilized  soil.  However,  if  the  seeds
were  infected  with  seed-borne  fungi,  then  there  is  still  a
possibility  of  increasing  the  source  of  inoculum  from  the
seeds  and  this  eventually  multiplied  in  the  soil.  Seeds
infected  with  pathogens  could  play  a  role  of  transferring
the  pathogens  to  a  new  place  and  be  a  primary  inoculum
source  in  the  field  [61].  A  drastic  reduction  in  soil
microbial  activity may  result in  rapid  re-infestation  of  the
sterilized  soil  by  a  contaminating  inoculum  with  this
ultimately leading to the incidence of disease, which could
even  be  higher  than  that  in  the  non-treated  soil  due  to  a
“biological vacuum” in the sterilized soil [62].

Significant variation was observed in terms of seed-borne
fungal  recovery  from  different  seed  components.  More
fungal  species  were  recovered  from  the  pericarp  of  both
sorghum  and  foxtail  millet  than  from  the  endosperm  and
embryo. The results derived from the current study found
out  that  species  of  Alternaria,  Curvularia,  and  Fusarium

216

Yago  et  al.

penetrated  the  endosperm  layer  of  the  seeds  and  further
colonization  of  Alternaria  and  Fusarium  was  observed  in
the  embryo.  The  percent  recovery  ranged  from  2.22%  to
64.44%. The same species of fungi were also observed in
the  penetrating  endosperm  and  embryo  in  carrot  seeds
[61]  and  eggplant  seeds  [63].  It  has  been  reported  that  A.
alternata  has  many  hosts  and  it  mostly  causes  leaf  blight
and  spots  on  a  variety  of  plants  [64, 65].  However,  the
fungus is also known as weak and opportunistic pathogen
or  a  saprophyte  in  many  plants.  There  has  been  no
previous  report  that  the  fungus  penetrates  the  endosperm
and embryo of sorghum.

According to the infection experiments carried out with
the  inoculation  of  the  most  dominant  recorded  fungi  (A.
alternata, C. lunata, F. solani and F. moniliforme), it has a
significant effect on the emergence of sorghum and foxtail
millet  seedlings.  There  were  an  increased  percentage  of
dead  seedlings  and  infected  seedlings  10  days  after
inoculation  and  the  index  of  severity  was  increased.  It
means  that  these  tested  isolates  were  pathogenic  during
the  seedling  stage.  The  same findings  were  also  observed
by  Zida  et  al.  [27]  in  sorghum  and  pearl  millet,  but  our
findings  are  not  in  accordance  with  the  findings  made  by
Mathur  et  al.  [25].  However,  considering  the  high
infection  level  encountered  in  the  seeds,  further  studies
are  necessary  to  elucidate  the  exact  role  of  this  fungus  in
seeds.

The results of our study indicated that seed-borne fungi
could  be  the  main  fungal  pathogen  involved  in  sorghum
and  foxtail  millet  plant  diseases  in  South  Korea.  The
presence  of  many  seed-borne  pathogenic  fungi  at  high
levels  from  various  geographical  areas  indicates  a  clear
need for field surveys for these fungi and other pathogens.
There  is  also  a  need  to  increase  public  awareness  on  the
aspects  related  to  seed  health  and  to  develop  suitable
management  for  improving  the  quality  of  seeds.  Testing
the  seed  health  of  major  crops  should  be  introduced  as  a
national seed quality control system.
