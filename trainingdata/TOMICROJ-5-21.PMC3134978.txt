Abstract:  Staphylococcus  aureus,  a  versatile  human  pathogen,  is  commonly  associated  with  medical  device  infections.  
Its capacity to  establish and maintain  these infections is thought to be related to  its ability to  form  adherent biofilms.  In 
this study, commercially available (cid:1)-amylase compounds from various biological sources were evaluated for their ability 
to reduce  and prevent biofilm formation of  several S. aureus  isolates. Our data demonstrates  that (cid:1)-amylase compounds 
can rapidly detach biofilms of S. aureus, as well as inhibit biofilm formation. Our data also demonstrates that (cid:1)-amylase 
compounds  have  an  ability  to  reduce  and  disassociate  S.  aureus  cell-aggregates  grown  in  liquid  suspension.  These  
findings  suggest  that  commercially  available  (cid:1)-amylase  compounds  could  be  used  in  the  future  to  control  S.  aureus 
biofilm-related infections.  

Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus, (cid:1)-amylases, Biofilm control, Biofilm-dispersing enzymes. 

INTRODUCTION 

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  an  important  human  pathogen, 
 
particularly in hospital settings, where it is a major source of 
life  threatening  bloodstream  infections  as  well  as  a  leading 
cause  of  implants  and  indwelling  medical  device  infections 
[1-3]. S. aureus is well adapted to the human host and has  a 
large  number  of  factors  that  enable  it  to  adhere  to  specific 
host  substrates,  evade  host  defenses,  and  resist  antibiotic 
therapy  [4-7].  One  way  in  which  the  bacteria  become  resis-
tant to antibiotics and host defenses is believed to be through 
biofilm formation [8, 9]. 

  Biofilms  are  defined  as  communities  of  microorganisms 
that are encased in a self-synthesized extracellular polymeric 
matrix (EPS) and grow attached to a biotic or abiotic surface 
[10, 11]. Bacterial biofilms have a significant impact on hu-
man  health  [12,  13],  as  they  frequently  exhibit  an  enhanced 
pathogenic  capability  relative  to  bacteria  in  solution  by  vir-
tue  of  sessile  behavior,  increased  resistance  to  antimicrobial 
agents, and the potential for detachment and distal emboliza-
tion of large biofilm fragments [14].  

  The  increase  in  biofilm-related  infection  and  the  neces-
sity  of  both  preventing  and  removing  microbial  biofilms 
from  an  infected  site  has  led  researchers  to  examine  new 
ways  to  control  surface  attached  bacteria.  Among  the  tech-
niques  proposed  to  control  biofilms  is  the  use  of  materials 
and coatings aimed at inhibiting initial cell adhesion, as well 
as  a  variety  of  treatments  designed  to  reduce  pre-existing 
biofilms,  such  as  heat,  cleaning  regimens,  low-power  laser, 
sonication,  chemical  treatments,  antibiotics,  quorum  sensing 
analogs,  lectins,  and  biological  control agents  such  as  inver-
tebrates,  protozoa,  bacteriophages,  and  predatory  bacteria  
 

[15-25].  Another  biofilm  control  strategy  makes  use  of  en-
zymes that degrade major structural components of the EPS, 
resulting in removal of the biofilm. Among the EPS degrad-
ing  enzymes  that  showed  potential  as  anti S.  aureus  biofilm 
agents  are  deoxyribonuclease  I  (DNase  I)  and  dispersin  B 
(DspB) [26-30]. DNase I was shown to degrade extracellular 
DNA,  which  functions  as  a  matrix  adhesion  molecule  in 
biofilms  produced  by  most  bacterial  species  [31],  whereas 
DspB  degrades  poly-(cid:2)-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  (PNAG), 
an extracellular polysaccharide that also functions in biofilm 
matrix adhesion in numerous phylogenetically diverse gram-
negative and gram-positive bacteria [32-34].  

In this study, we  examined  the potential use of  commer-

 
cially  available  (cid:1)-amylase  compounds  as  a  method  for  
inhibiting  both  cell-to-cell  and  cell-to-surface  association  of 
S.  aureus,  as  well  as  the  aptitude  of  the  enzyme  to  detach 
pre-existing aggregates and biofilms of S. aureus.

#A1031),  and  (cid:3)-amylase  from  sweet  potato  (Sigma,  catalog 
#A7005).  

Biofilm Formation Assay 

  Biofilm  assay  was  performed  similar  to  the  previously 
described methods [36]. Overnight cultures of staphylococci 
were grown in liquid broth. Cultures were diluted, to an A600 
of  0.01  ((cid:1)1x108  CFU/ml),  in  tryptic  soy  broth  (TSB)  sup-
plemented  with  0.6%  yeast  extract,  0.8%  glucose,  and  0.2% 
sodium citrate, to give  TSB citrate  media (TSBC). This me-
dium  composition  was  selected  for  its  ability  to  stimulate 
biofilm formation in S. aureus [35, 37]. One hundred micro-
liters  of  cells  were  added  to  individual  wells  of  tissue  cul-
ture-treated,  96-well  polystyrene  microtiter  dishes  (Costar, 
Corning  Inc.,  Corning,  NY).  These  were  incubated  in  a 
closed, humidified plastic container for 18 hrs at 37oC before 
being  assayed  for  biofilm  formation.  Non-adherent  cells 
were  removed  by  washing  and  adherent  cells  were  stained 
with  0.1%  crystal  violet  (CV)  as  previously  described  [38]. 
S.  epidermidis  biofilms  were  developed  in  TSB  media  [26]. 
Photographs  of  the  plate  were  taken  with  a  Canon-scan 
4400F digital scanner, then the crystal violet was solubilized 
using 50% acetic acid for 10 min. Relative biofilm formation 
was assayed by measuring the absorbance of the crystal vio-
let  solution  at  600  nm  (OD600).  In  addition  to  CV,  biofilms 
were  also  stained  and  visualized  by  using  1  mg/ml  Congo-
red (Sigma-Aldrich, St.  Louis,  MO),  and 1 (cid:1)l/ml  Pico-green 
dsDNA  stain  (Invitrogen,  Eugene,  OR).  For  biofilm  forma-
tion on polyurethane, a polymer routinely used in the manu-
facture  of  medical  devices,  a  polyurethane  tube  (Nalgene, 
Rochester, NY) was cut into 3mm pieces and inserted into a 
24-well  costar  plate.  The  well  was  filled  with  0.5  ml  of 
TSBC  media  containing  S.  aureus  SH1000  cells  and  incu-
bated for 18 hrs to allow biofilm development. For statistical 
analyses, P values were determined by using a Student t-test 
performed  with  Microsoft  Excel  software.  Error  bars  are 
shown as one standard deviation. 

Cell Aggregation Assay 

  Overnight  cultures  of  staphylococci  were  diluted  1:1000 
in TSBC. Five ml of the cell suspension was placed in an 18 
mm  glass  tube  and  incubated  for  18  hr  at  37oC  on  a  TC-7 
tissue  culture  roller  drum  (New  Brunswick  Sci,  New-
Brunswick, NJ)  set on 30 RPM. To  examine  the  aggregates, 
the  cultures  were  poured  into  a  90  mm  Petri-dish  and  visu-
ally  examined.  Fluorescent  microscopy  was  used  after  1  μl 
of  Calcofluor-white  (Sigma-Aldrich,  St.  Louis,  MO)  was 
added to the  tube.  To measure  the extent of aggregation, the 
overnight culture tubes containing the aggregates were left to 
stand  for  20  min  to  allow  aggregates  to  settle  to  the  bottom 
of  the  tube.  Turbidity  of  the  suspension  (optical  density  of 
the suspension [ODs]) was measured at 600 nm. The culture 
was  then dispersed by  a 10s  sonication step, using a  VC505 
sonicator (Sonics and  Materials Inc., Newtown, CT) and the 
total  turbidity  was  measured  (ODt).  The  percentage  of  ag-
gregation was estimated as follows: % aggregation = [(ODt – 
ODs)  x  100]/ODt  [21,  39].  As  for  the  biofilm  assay,  TSBC 
medium was chosen for its ability to stimulate S. aureus cell 
clustering and aggregation [35, 37].

Inhibition and Reduction Assays 

  To  assess  the  ability  of  the  enzyme  to  inhibit  biofilm 
formation  or  the  formation  of  cell  clusters  (aggregates), 
biofilm  or  aggregation  tubes  were  incubated  for  18  hrs  with 
or  without  (control)  the  enzyme  before  being  analyzed.  To 
measure  the  ability  of  the  enzyme  to  reduce  an  existing 
biofilm,  cells  were  first  grown  in  96-well  plates  for  18  hrs 
(pre-formed  biofilm).  Thereafter,  non-adherent  cells  were 
removed  and  fresh  TSBC  medium,  containing  the  enzyme, 
was  added  to  the  biofilm  and  incubated  at  37oC  for  the  
duration  of  the  experiment.  To  evaluate  the  ability  of  the 
enzyme  to  disassociate  S.  aureus  aggregates,  enzyme  was 
added  directly  to  the  tube  containing  overnight  aggregates 
(pre-formed aggregates). The tubes were returned to incubate 
on the roller drum following aggregation quantification.  

Scanning Electron Microscopy 

  Experiments were performed as described previously [20, 
21]. In brief, S. aureus biofilms were developed on a 12x22 
mm PVC plastic cover slip. The cover slips were placed in a 
24-well  polystyrene  cell  culture  plate  and  incubated  for  18 
hrs.  Biofilms  and  enzymatic  assays  were  prepared  as  de-
scribed above. S. aureus biofilms were rinsed to remove any 
planktonic cells before being fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 
M sodium cacodylate, and 0.1% ruthenium red. Images were 
viewed  at  the  air-liquid  interface  using  a  Hitachi  S-2500 
scanning electron microscope (SEM).  

RESULTS 

Biofilm Reduction and Inhibition Experiments 

  To assess the ability of (cid:2)-amylase to reduce an existing S. 
aureus  biofilm,  S.  aureus  SH1000  biofilms  were  developed 
in  96-well  plates.  Thereafter,  the  biofilms  were  washed  and 
fresh TSBC media containing 100 mg/ml of (cid:2)-amylase com-
pound from A. oryzae was added to the wells. The plate was 
incubated for 10 min at 37oC before being analyzed. As seen 
in Fig. (1A), a clear decrease in CV staining was observed in 
the  amylase  treated  wells  (Biofilm-reduction)  compared  to 
the  initial  biofilm  (Pre-formed  biofilm).  The  change  in 
biofilm  biomass  was  further  assessed  using  CV  quantifica-
tion.  A  significant  90%  (P<0.001)  reduction  in  CV  staining 
was measured following a 10 min incubation period with the 
enzyme (1B, amylase) with a 5% drop in the control sample 
containing TSBC alone (1B, control). To further validate that 
the  decrease  in  biofilm  biomass  is  due  to  the  enzyme  activ-
ity, the enzyme was heat-deactivated (85oC for 120 min). As 
seen  in  Fig.  (1A  and  1B),  no  reduction  in  CV  staining  
was  observed  in  the  biofilms  after  incubation  with  the  
heat-deactivated enzyme. To assess  the effect of the enzyme  
on  a  polysaccharide-based  component  that  might  be  present  
in the biofilm, parallel wells were stained with Congo-red. A  
noticeable  drop  in  biofilm  Congo-red  staining  was  seen  fol-
lowing  a  10  min  enzyme  treatment,  compared  to  the  robust 
staining  in  the  initial  biofilm  (1A,  Pre-formed)  and  in  
the  control  treated  sample  (data  not  shown).  By  using  DNA 
stain  and  SEM  imaging,  we  were  able  to  further  visualize 
changes  in  biofilm  cell-surface  coverage.  A  clear  decrease  
in  biofilm  cell  density  was  seen  in  the  enzyme  treated  
samples when compared to the initial biofilm, with the latter

Fig.  (1).  Biofilm  reduction  and  inhibition  assay.  (A)  S.  aureus  SH1000  biofilms  were  developed  for  18  hrs  with  (biofilm  inhibition)  or 
without  (pre-formed  biofilm)  the  addition  of  100  mg/ml  (cid:1)-amylase.  In  another  experiment,  S.  aureus  biofilms  (pre-formed  biofilm)  were 
rinsed and exposed for 10 min to the enzyme (biofilm reduction) or to a heat-deactivated enzyme. Biofilms were rinsed and stained with CV, 
Congo-red  or  Pico-green  (DNA  stain).  The  experiments  were  also  carried  out  on  S.  aureus  biofilms  developed  on  polyurethane  tubes.  For 
SEM imaging, biofilms were developed on PVC plastic cover slips. DNA stain was visualized under fluorescent microscope at 400X magni-
fication. Scanning electron micrographs were viewed at 500X magnification. Each experiment was carried out at least six times yielding simi-
lar results. (B) Quantification of biofilm reduction. Pre-formed overnight biofilms (Pre-formed) were incubated for 10 min with fresh TSBC 
media (Control), TSBC supplemented with 100 mg/ml enzyme (amylase), or heat deactivated enzyme (HD amylase). The wells were rinsed, 
stained  with  CV,  and  the  amount  of  CV  staining  was  quantified  at  A600  (OD  600). (C)  Quantification  of  biofilm  inhibition.  S.  aureus  cells 
were  cultured  in  96-well  plates  with  TSBC  media  (Control),  media  supplemented  with  100  mg/ml  enzyme  (amylase),  or  heat  deactivated 
enzyme (HD amylase). After 18 hrs the plates were rinsed, stained with CV, and the amount of CV staining was quantified. (D) Quantifica-
tion  of S.  epidermidis  biofilm  inhibition.  S.  epidermidis cells  were  cultured  in  96-well  plates  with  TSB  media  (Control)  and  media  supple-
mented with 100 mg/ml enzyme (amylase). After 18 hrs, the plates were rinsed, stained with CV, and the amount of CV staining was quanti-
fied. (E) Quantification of S. epidermidis biofilm reduction. Pre-formed overnight biofilms (Pre-formed) were incubated for 4 hrs with fresh 
TSB media (Control) or TSB supplemented with 100 mg/ml enzyme (amylase). The wells were rinsed,  stained with CV, and the amount of 
CV staining was quantified at A600 (OD 600). Each value represents the mean of 24 wells from one representative experiment. Error bars are 
shown as one-standard deviation. Each experiment was carried out three times yielding similar results.

exhibiting  a  substantial  biofilm  cell  population  attached  to 
the surface (Fig. 1A).  

 
In  another  experiment,  the  ability  of  the  enzyme  com-
pound  to  inhibit  biofilm  formation  was  evaluated. S.  aureus 
SH1000  cells  were  incubated  in  TSBC  media  (control)  or 
TSBC  media  supplemented  with  100  mg/ml  of  (cid:1)-amylase 
from A. oryzae. The biofilms were left to develop at 37oC for 
18 hrs before the extent of biofilm formation was measured. 
As before, a robust biofilm developed in the wells incubated 
with  TSBC  (1A,  Pre-formed).  However,  a  significantly 
(P<0.001)  reduced  biofilm  formed  in  the  wells  which  were 
incubated  simultaneously  with  the  enzyme  during  biofilm 
development,  as  seen  by  CV,  Congo-red,  DNA,  and  SEM 
imaging (1A, biofilm inhibition). CV quantification revealed 
that biofilm development in the presence of the enzyme was 
80%  less  than  the  biofilm  buildup  in  either  TSBC  media 
alone  or  TSBC  media  supplemented  by  heat-deactivated 
enzyme  (1C,  amylase,  Control,  and  HD  amylase,  respec-
tively).  The  ability of the enzyme to both reduce and  inhibit 
biofilm formation was consistent on all of the examined sur-
faces,  which  included  polystyrene  (used  in  the  96-well 
plates),  PVC  (used  for  SEM  imaging),  and  polyurethane 
(Fig. 1A, polyurethane tubes). Although the (cid:1)-amylase com-
pound was shown to both inhibit and reduce biofilm buildup 
of S. aureus, it was not efficient in controlling S. epidermidis 
biofilms.  Similar  biofilm  accumulation  was  measured  in 
wells  inoculated  with  S.  epidermidis  alone  and  S.  epider-
midis  supplemented  with  100  mg/ml  (cid:1)-amylase  (Fig.  1D).  
(cid:1)-amylase  also  did  not  cause  S.  epidermidis  biofilm  
detachment  with  biofilm  measuring  A600=2.8  in  wells  
that were incubated for 4 hrs with (cid:1)-amylase or TSB control 
(Fig. 1E). 

In  order  to  investigate  whether  the  biofilm  reducing  and 
 
inhibiting  effect  could  be  attributed  to  loss  of  cell  viability, 
5x108  CFU/ml  S.  aureus  SH1000  were  incubated  overnight 
in  PBS  buffer  containing  100  mg/ml  A.  oryzae  (cid:1)-amylase 
compound. No reduction in cell viability was measured after 
a  24  hr  incubation  period,  with  4x108  CFU/ml  remaining  in 
the  samples  maintained  in  PBS  alone  or  PBS  with  amylase. 
The  enzyme  also  did  not  exhibit  any  bactericidal  or  bacte-
riostatic  effect  when  incubated  for  24  hrs  with  S.  aureus, 
reaching  a  cell  density  of  6.2x109,  6.1x109,  and  5.8x109 
CFU/ml  when  incubated  in  the  presence  of  TSBC,  TSBC 
supplemented  with  100  mg/ml  amylase,  and  TSBC  contain-
ing 200 mg/ml amylase, respectively.  

  A time point experiment in which S. aureus SH1000 pre-
formed  biofilms  were  incubated  in  the  presence  of  100 
mg/ml enzyme demonstrated that the biofilm reducing activ-
ity  is  extremely  rapid,  reducing  79%  of  the  existing  biofilm 
within  5  min,  and  reaching  89%  reduction  after  30  min  of 
incubation.  No  significant  increase  in  biofilm  reduction  was 
measured  following  an  additional  24  hr  incubation  period 
(Fig.  2A).  In  order  to  examine  the  minimal  concentration 
required  to effectively remove  the biofilm, serial diluted en-
zyme  was  added  to  the  pre-formed  biofilm.  A  90%,  89%, 
and  72%  reduction  was  observed  in  the  wells  which  were 
incubated  for  45  min  with  100,  20,  and  10  mg/ml  enzyme, 
respectively, with a 36% and 23% reduction measured in the 
wells incubated with 2 and 1 mg/ml (Fig. 2B, white bars). By 
24  hrs,  a  reduction  greater  than  77%  was  seen  in  all  of  the 
examined  enzyme  concentrations  (Fig. 2B,  gray  bars).  Incu-

Craigen et al. 

bating S. aureus  cells in  the presence of 100 to 1 mg/ml en-
zyme  also  demonstrated  a  positive  correlation  between  the 
enzyme  quantity  present  in  the  well  and  biofilm  inhibition, 
with 82% 81%, 80%, 68%, and 64%  less biofilm buildup in 
the  wells  incubated  with  100,  20,  10,  2,  and  1  mg/ml  en-
zyme,  respectively,  as  compared  to  the  biofilm  in  enzyme- 
free media (Fig. 2C, Control).  

The Effect of (cid:1)-amylase on S. Aureus Clinical Isolates 

  To examine the  effect of (cid:1)-amylase compound on differ-
ent S. aureus isolates, 8 additional S. aureus clinical isolates 
were  grown  in  TSBC  media  with  and  without  the  enzyme. 
As  seen  in  Fig.  (3A),  the  biofilms  produced  in  the  presence 
of the enzyme (3A, biofilm  inhibition) were less robust  than 
those grown in enzyme-free media (3A, pre-formed biofilm). 
These results were also confirmed by CV quantification that 
demonstrated a decrease of 65% to 83% in biofilm formation 
(3B,  gray  bars),  with  the  exception  of  S.  aureus  427,  which 
had  38%  less  biomass  in  the  treated  sample.  Treating  the 
pre-formed  biofilms  with  the  enzyme  for  10  min  brought 
about  a  measurable  decrease  in  all  of  the  isolates  examined, 
with  the  most  significant  decreases  of  70%-80%  measured 
for S. aureus isolates 442, 417, 425, and 253, and more mod-
est  reductions  of  45%-60%  measured  for  isolates  424,  427, 
MU 50 and SMC 3256 (Fig. 3C). 

Biofilm  Inhibition  and  Reduction  by  amylases  from  
Different Biological Sources 

  To compare the biofilm reducing ability of commercially 
available  amylase  compounds  isolated  from  different  bio-
logical  sources,  S.  aureus  SH1000  was  incubated  with  10 
mg/ml of the following enzymes: (cid:1)-amylase compound from 
B.  subtilis,  (cid:1)-amylase  compound  from  human  saliva,  (cid:2)-
amylase  compound  from  sweet  potato,  and  (cid:1)-amylase  com-
pound  from  A.  oryzae,  which  was  used  as  a  positive  control 
in this experiment. After 10  min of incubation, a substantial 
reduction  in  biofilm  CV  staining  was  seen  only  in  the  wells 
incubated  with  (cid:1)-amylase  from  A.  oryzae  (Fig.  4A  and  4B, 
white  bars).  However,  by  3  hrs,  a  significant  reduction 
(P<0.001)  was  also  observed  in  the  wells  incubated  with  (cid:1)-
amylase  from  B.  subtilis  (4B,  gray  bars).  No  substantial 
biofilm reduction was measured for the pre-formed biofilms 
incubated  with  (cid:2)-amylase  compound  and  (cid:1)-amylase  com-
pound from human saliva. In contrast to their biofilm reduc-
ing aptitude, all of the (cid:1)-amylase compounds exhibited some 
biofilm  inhibiting  capability when incubated  in the presence 
of  S.  aureus  cells  (Fig.  4C),  with  the  most  potent  inhibiting 
effect  measured  for  (cid:1)-amylase  compound  from  A.  oryzae 
(77%  inhibition),  B.  subtilis  (88%  inhibition),  and  human 
saliva  (89%  inhibition).  A  more  moderate,  but  measurable, 
inhibition  registered  in  wells  containing  (cid:2)-amylase  from 
sweet potato (49% inhibition).  

 
Since  the  purity  of  the  commercially  acquired  com-
pounds  is  not  fully  known,  biofilm  inhibition  experiments 
were conducted in which S. aureus SH1000 was incubated in 
the  presence  of  (cid:1)-amylase  from  A.  oryzae  with  and  without 
the addition of a protease inhibitor (Halttm protease  inhibitor 
cocktail,  Thermo  Scientific,  Rockford,  IL).  The  addition  of 
protease inhibitor did not reduce the biofilm inhibiting effect 
of  the  amylase  compound,  with  biofilm  buildup  reaching 
A600=0.52,  0.56  and  3.17  in  wells  inoculated  with  amylase

trol,  respectively.  Protease  inhibitor  cocktail  also  did  not 
abolish  the  ability  of  the  amylase  compound  to  remove  a 
preformed biofilm with a 70±1.8% reduction in wells inocu-
lated with amylase alone and 66±4% reduction in wells con-
taining  amylase  plus  protease  inhibitor.  To  determine 
whether  DNase  is  present  in  the  amylase  compound,  (cid:1)-
amylase from A. oryzae was prepared and spotted on DifcoTm 
DNase  test  agar  plates  with  methyl  green  (BD,  Franklin 
Lakes, NJ). No DNase activity was seen after incubating the 
plates for up to 48 hrs (data not shown).  

Aggregation Reduction and Inhibition Experiments 

In  the  previous  experiments,  emphasis  was  put  on  the 
 
ability  of  the  enzyme  to  detach  pre-formed  biofilms  or  in-

hibit the attachment of cells to the examined surface, leading 
to  biofilm  reduction  and  inhibition.  In  the  following  experi-
ments,  the  aim  was  to  investigate  whether  cell-to-cell  asso-
ciations could also be affected by the presence of (cid:1)-amylase 
compound in the surrounding media. To this end, a bioassay 
was performed in which cells were grown in TSBC media in 
order  to  stimulate  cell-to-cell  association  and  aggregation. 
The ability of the enzyme to inhibit the formation of the ag-
gregate was  achieved by simultaneously incubating the cells 
with 50 mg/ml of the enzyme from A. oryzae during growth. 
As  seen  in  (Fig.  5A)  growing  S.  aureus  SH1000  cells  in 
TSBC  resulted  in  the  formation  of  extremely  large  macro-
colonies  (>1mm)  that  were  visible  by  eye  (Fig.  5A,  Pre-
formed  aggregates).  These  macro-colonies,  composed  of 
hundreds of cells, were positively stained by the polysaccha-

rescence  microscopy  (Fig.  5A).  Large  macro-colonies  did 
not develop in tubes that contained the enzyme (5A, Aggre-
gate  inhibition).  Light  microscopy  also  confirmed  the  ab-
sence  of  macro-colonies  in  the  enzyme-  treated  sample,  as 
only  relatively  small  cell  clusters,  consisting  of  2-10  cells, 
were formed. In order to quantify the extent of macro-colony 
inhibition,  S.  aureus  isolates  SH1000,  427,  442,  and  SMC 
3256 were grown in the presence of the enzyme and the ex-
tent  of  aggregation  was  analyzed.  These  isolates  were  se-
lected  for  their  enhanced  aggregation  phenotype  in  TSBC 
media.  After  18  hrs  of  incubation,  53%  to  76%  of  the  cells 
were present in aggregates (Fig. 5B, white bars). In contrast, 

only  6%-12%  aggregation  was  measured  in  the  enzyme- 
treated tubes (Fig. 5B, gray bars).  

In  another  experiment,  the  ability  of  the  enzyme  to  de-
 
grade  existing  macro-colonies  was  evaluated  by  adding  100 
mg/ml  (cid:1)-amylase  compound  from  A.  oryzae  into  the  pre-
formed  aggregate  tube.  Within  3  hrs  of  incubation,  a  clear 
reduction  in  macro-colonies  was  seen,  with  aggregates  of 
only 20 cells or less remaining in the enzyme- treated sample 
(Fig.  5A,  aggregate  reduction).  Quantifying  the  extent  of 
reduction revealed decreases of 59%, 66%, 74%, and 79% in 
SH1000 aggregation within 30 min, 1hr, 2hr and 3hr incuba-
tion  periods,  respectively.  Aggregation  reductions  of  77%,

DISCUSSION 

 
In  the  last  few  years,  biofilm  formation  has  become  an 
increasing source of concern in industrial, environmental and 
medical  settings.  This  is  especially  true  in  orthopedic  medi-
cine,  where  biofilms  pose  a  significant  challenge  and  can 
result  in  some  of  the  most  serious  complications  involving 
prosthetic  and  other  medical  device  infections,  impacting 

morbidity,  mortality,  and  medical  costs  [40].  The  necessity 
of  removing  the  biofilm  from  the  infected  site  usually  re-
quires surgical intervention and radical antimicrobial therapy 
[41].  A  possible  therapeutic  approach  to  medical  device  in-
fections involves the use of EPS-degrading agents that might 
block,  inhibit  or  reduce  cell-to-cell  and  cell-to-surface  asso-
ciations  within  the  biofilm,  bringing  about  the  release  of 
planktonic  cells  into  the  environment  and  allowing  the  host 
immune  system  and  antimicrobial  drugs  to  eliminate  the  in-
fection [42, 43].  

Controlling S. aureus Biofilms 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5    29 

 
In this study, we  examined  the potential use of  commer-
cially  available  (cid:1)-amylase  compounds  as  a  biofilm  control 
agent  against  S.  aureus.  Our  work  demonstrated  that,  when 
grown in the presence of the enzyme, a significant reduction 
in  biofilm  buildup  is  achieved.  The  biofilm  inhibition  effect 
was observed with all of the examined S. aureus isolates and 
was  not  influenced  by  the  chemical  composition  of  the  sur-
face  on  which  the  biofilm  developed.  A  measurable  reduc-
tion  in  biofilm  buildup  was  also  seen  for S.  aureus  biofilms 
incubated with (cid:1)-amylase compounds derived from bacterial, 
fungal,  and  human  origin.  However,  a  reduced  inhibiting 
effect  was  registered  for  (cid:2)-amylase.  The  difference  in 
biofilm  reduction  could  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  (cid:2)-
amylase  is  an  exo-acting  carbohydrolase  which  hydrolyzes 
the  (cid:1)-1,4-glucosidic  linkages  of  starch  only  from  the  non-
reducing end of the polysaccharide, as opposed to (cid:1)-amylase, 
which  can  act  simultaneously  anywhere  on  the  substrate, 
thus (cid:1)-amylase tends to be faster-acting than (cid:2)-amylase [44]. 
In addition to the enzyme’s capacity to inhibit the formation 
of  S.  aureus  biofilms,  (cid:1)-amylase  also  rapidly  reduced  exist-
ing  pre-formed  biofilms  at  concentrations  as  low  as  10 
mg/ml,  with  a  1-mg/ml  enzyme  concentration  requiring 
longer  incubation  periods  to  achieve  comparable  biofilm 
reduction.  As  was  demonstrated  for  biofilm  inhibition,  the 
biofilm reducing ability was consistent on all of the surfaces 
and  isolates  tested  as  well  as  with  (cid:1)-amylase  compounds 
derived  from  A.  oryzae  and  B.  subtilis.  However,  it  is  
interesting  to  note  that  (cid:1)-amylase  from  human  saliva  only 
produced  a  limited  drop  in  biofilm  biomass  and  that  
no  reduction  was  observed  in  the  biofilms  incubated  with  
(cid:2)-amylase.  

  Biofilms  in  most  settings  are  multicellular  structures 
composed  of  both  cell-to-surface  and  cell-to-cell  associa-
tions.  In  order  to  examine  the  effect  of  the  (cid:1)-amylase  com-
pound  specifically  on  cell-to-cell  interactions,  experiments 
were  conducted  in  conditions  that  stimulated  cell  clustering 
and aggregation. Here too, (cid:1)-amylase from A. oryzae had the 
potency  to  inhibit  the  formation  of  S.  aureus  aggregates  as 
well as reduce pre-existing aggregates.  

 
It was previously suggested that EPS degrading enzymes 
have  a  biological  role  in  enabling  surface  attached  cells  to 
dislodge from one site and relocate, for example, Aggregati-
bacter  actinomycetemcomitans  biofilm  detachment  and  dis-
persal is mediated by the production of dispersin B, a poly-(cid:2)-
1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  (PNAG)  hydrolyzing  enzyme 
[45-47].  The  biological  role  of  dispersin  B  in  A.  actinomy-
cetemcomitans  and  the  fact  that  PNGA  is  produced  in  other 
bacteria  such  as S.  aureus,  S.  epidermidis,  Escherichia  coli, 
Actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae,  Yersinia  pestis,  and  Bor-
detella  spp.  led  to  studies  aimed  at  using  the  enzyme  to  de-
tach biofilms as well as a means of  enhancing  the  effective-
ness  of  antimicrobial  agents  [27-29,  47-50].  In  addition  to 
dispersin  B,  other  carbohydrate  degrading  enzymes  were 
shown  to  have  an  effect  on  biofilm  EPS  components.  In 
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  degradation  of  the  alginate  by 
alginate-lyase  enhanced  antibiotic  biofilm  killing  [51], 
whereas  the  use  of  cellulase  was  shown  to  degrade  a  carbo-
hydrate-rich  component  of 
the  matrix.  This  cellulase-
sensitive  sugar  was  also  shown  to  bind  Congo-red  and  is 
essential  for  P.  aeruginosa  pellicle  formation  and  biofilm 
structure  [52,  53].  The  role  of  an  amylose-like  polysaccha-

ride in biofilm formation was also documented in Salmonella 
enteritidis  [54],  Agrobacterium  tumefaciens  [55],  Pseudo-
monas  spp.  CE-2  [56],  P.  putida  [57]  and  Streptomyces 
coelicolor,  in  which  cellulose-anchored  amyloidal  fimbriae 
were shown to mediate biofilm formation [58]. The success-
ful  use  of  proteolytic  enzymes  with  other  polysaccharide 
degrading  enzymes,  including  (cid:1)-amylase,  as  means  to  re-
move biofilms, was recently demonstrated for bacteria found 
in the food and brewing  industry, including Bacillus cereus, 
P.  fluorescens,  Flavimonas  oryzihabitans,  Lactobacillus  
brevis,  Leuconostoc  mesenteroides  and  Saccharomyces  
cerevisiae [59-61]. 

  The use of enzymes capable of specifically degrading the 
constituents  of  the  extracellular  S.  aureus  matrix  was  the 
focus  of  other  studies.  Chaignon  and  his  colleagues  demon-
strated that treating S. aureus strain 383 biofilms with prote-
inase K and trypsin, as well  as pancreatine and Pectinex Ul-
tra SP, leads to biofilm detachment, however, biofilm reduc-
tion was not seen when dispersin B or sodium periodate was 
applied  [50].  Since  both  Pectinex  Ultra  SP  and  Pancreatin 
are  multi-component  enzyme  preparations  containing  prote-
ase  activity  and a wide range of carbohydrolases, it was dif-
ficult  to  attribute  the  biofilm  reducing  effect  to  any  single 
enzyme [62]. The inability to reduce a pre-existing S. aureus 
biofilm  by  dispersin  B  was  also  concurred  by  Jeffrey  Kap-
lan’s  group.  However,  their  study  did  demonstrate  that  dis-
persin  B  is  effective  in  inhibiting  biofilm  formation  of  the 
SH1000 strain [28]. Thus, the discrepancy in the ability of an 
enzyme  to  reduce S.  aureus  biofilms  at  early  vs.  late  stages 
of biofilm formation is consistent with our finding that some 
amylase  compounds  were  more  competent  at  inhibiting 
biofilm  buildup  than  reducing  existing  biofilms.  In  addition 
to  the  proteolytic  and  PNAG-modifying  enzymes,  DNase-I 
was  also shown to be  effective in  inhibiting and reducing S. 
aureus SH1000 biofilms [28].  

 
In  this  study,  we  have  used  several  commercially  avail-
able (cid:1)-amylase compounds. As it is difficult to guarantee the 
purity  of  the  compounds,  we  could  only  speculate  that  the 
biofilm  controlling  aptitude of the  compounds resulted from 
the  amylase  activity.  The  finding  that  several  (cid:1)-amylase 
compounds  had  an  ability  to  control  S.  aureus  biofilms,  in 
concert with the fact that the enzyme activity was not  inhib-
ited  in  the  presence  of  protease  inhibitors  nor  did  it  possess 
any  DNase  activity,  lessen  the  possibility  that  the  biofilm 
removal  effect  was  caused  by  other  enzymes,  which  might 
also be present in the acquired compounds. Furthermore, the 
inability  of  the  compounds  to  affect S.  epidermidis biofilms 
suggests  that  the  activity  of  the  enzyme  is  not  through  the 
degradation of the PNAG matrix, as this would have affected 
the stability of the PNAG rich S. epidermidis biofilms [28]. 

  At this point, we can only speculate on the exact origin of 
the  substrate  being  degraded  by  the  amylase  compounds,  as 
the  composition  of  S.  aureus  biofilms  are  quite  diverse  and 
could  vary  depending  on  the  strain,  the  biofilm  growth  con-
ditions, and the biofilm developmental stage [28, 35, 63-65]. 
However, based on the research conducted so far, we believe 
that  commercially  available  polysaccharide-modifying  com-
pounds  could  be  used  in  the  future  as  a  preventative  meas-
ure, to prevent the establishment of a biofilm, or as a method 
used to eradicate an already existing biofilm infection.
