Histidine, lysine, ornithine, and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 38 strains
of Staphylococcus (15 of S. equorum, 11 ofS. epidermidis, 7 ofS. saprophyticus, and 5 of
S. pasteuri) and 19 strains of Bacillus (13 of B. subtilis and 6 ofB. amyloliquefaciens ) iso-
lated from two Spanish traditional sausage varieties.The four decarboxylase activities were
present in most of the strains studied, but some variability was observed between strains
within each microbial species. Accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was assessed in
the culture media of the strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities.
The aminogenic potential of the strains was low, with amounts accumulated lower than
25 mg/L for the putrescine and than 5 mg/L for the cadaverine, with the exception of a strain
of S. equorum that produced 1415 mg/L of putrescine, and of a strain of S. epidermidis that
accumulated 977 mg/L of putrescine and 36 mg/L of cadaverine.

INTRODUCTION
Biogenic amines are basic nitrogen compounds usually formed by
decarboxylation of precursor amino acids (Janz et al., 1983; Halász
et al., 1994; Silla Santos, 1996).

Formation of biogenic amines in foods is important for health
and also for unfavorable effects on ﬂavor (Suzzi and Gardini,
2003). Biogenic amines affect blood pressure, and excessive quanti-
ties in food can trigger migraines, gastric and intestinal problems,
and allergic responses in sensitive people (Smith, 1980; Taylor,
1985; Stratton et al., 1991). These substances are especially dan-
gerous in people being treated with monoaminooxidase enzyme
inhibitors (Stratton et al., 1991).

During ripening of meat products, the proteins undergo degra-
dation processes;
large peptides are ﬁrst generated and then
degraded into oligopeptides, and these are in turn degraded to
free amino acids. The free amino acids are then catabolized, giv-
ing rise to different compounds such as ammonia, α-ketoacids,
methylketones, and amines.

In meat products, formation of biogenic amines is largely asso-
ciated with the activity of microorganisms present in meat (Ten
Brink et al., 1990; Shalaby, 1996; Paulsen and Bauer, 1997). Ripen-
ing of sausages provides conditions that are very favorable for
the production of biogenic amines, due to the active growth of
microbial populations, acidiﬁcation, and proteolysis.

Different measures have been taken with the aim of preventing
or minimizing formation of biogenic amines during the man-
ufacture of raw-cured sausages, such as improved hygiene in
production plants, the use of starter cultures formed by lactic acid
bacteria with acidifying capacity, and the use of certain preserv-
atives (Buncic et al., 1993; Maijala et al., 1993; Bover-Cid et al.,
2000a,b; Suzzi and Gardini, 2003; Komprda et al., 2004; Lu et al.,
2010). Although such practices usually reduce the production of
biogenic amines, they do not totally prevent the production, and

moreover, the increased proteolysis that results from the use of
starter cultures may actually increase the availability of amino
acids precursors.

Complete inhibition of biogenic amine formation during pro-
duction of sausages, without any adverse effects, is desirable.
However, production of biogenic amines is an extremely complex
phenomenon that depends on several variables such as the growth
kinetics of the microorganisms and their proteolytic and decar-
boxylase activities. In order to design strategies for speciﬁc inhibi-
tion of the production of these compounds, it is essential to obtain
information about the potential production of biogenic amines by
the microorganisms present in fermented meat products.

Of all the microbial groups present during the fermenta-
tion/ripening of the raw-cured sausages, the Enterobacteriaceae
and the lactic acid bacteria have been abundantly studied as pro-
ducers of biogenic amines. Information in the literature about the
ability of the Staphylococcus species to produce biogenic amines is
more reduced (Masson et al., 1996; Silla Santos, 1998; Martín et al.,
2006; Drosinos et al., 2007; Bonomo et al., 2009; Even et al., 2010),
and studies on the production of biogenic amines by Bacillus
species are practically inexistent.

The objective of this research was to investigate the decarboxy-
lase activity and the ability to produce biogenic amines “in vitro”
by the species of Staphylococcus and Bacillus isolated from two
Spanish traditional sausage varieties, with the aim of to elucidate
the role of the microorganisms belonging to these two genera in
the production of biogenic amines during the manufacture of the
fermented and ripened sausages.

Aminogenesis by Staphylococcus and Bacillus

19 strains of Bacillus (13 of B. subtilis and 6 of B. amylolique-
faciens) were used. The strains were isolated from 20 units of
Androlla sausage and from 15 units of Botillo sausage (two Span-
ish traditional sausage varieties) at the end of the manufacturing
process. Manufacture process and features of these two sausages
have been previously described (Lorenzo et al., 2000). The strains
were initially identiﬁed by classical methods in previous researches
(García Fontán et al., 2007a,b) and their identity was conﬁrmed
prior carrying out the present work by sequentiation of the 16S
rRNA gene, comparing the obtained sequences with those avail-
able in the database GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology
Information, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Strains were molecular typed by (GTG)5-PCR ﬁngerprinting
techniques. Genomic DNA extracted from each strain was sub-
jected to rep-PCR analysis using the single oligonucleotide primer
(GTG)5 (Iacumin et al., 2006). Reactions were carried out in a
ﬁnal volume of 25 μL containing 12.5 μL of 2× ReddyMix 1.5 mM
MgCl2 (ABgene, Epsom, UK), 2 μL of extracted DNA, and 1 μM
of (GTG)5 primer. Ampliﬁcations were performed in a MyCy-
cler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Initial denaturation
(95˚C, 2 min) was followed by 31 cycles of denaturation at 94˚C
for 3 s, a step at 92˚C for 30 s, primer annealing at 40˚C for 1 min
and extension at 65˚C for 8 min. The last cycle was followed by the
ﬁnal single extension step (65˚C, 8 min).
Amplicons were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose
gel in buffer TBE 1× at 75 V for 2 h. After the run, gels were stained
with ethidium bromide 1 μg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)
for 30 min. The resulting ﬁngerprints were visualized under UV
light and digitally captured using the imaging system Gel Doc
XR+ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) and analyzed with the Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA).
Strains were stored at −80˚C in BHI broth (Oxoid Ltd., Bas-
ingstoke, Hampshire, UK), with 20% glycerol as a cryoprotective
agent. Before use, the strains were reactivated by incubation in
BHI broth at 37˚C.

PREPARATION OF INOCULA
In order to prepare the inocula used in the quantitative analysis,
ﬁrstly a correlation between the log CFU/mL and the Optical Den-
sity (at 650 nm) of the cultures was established for each strain by
determining throughout the growth the O.D. and the log CFU/mL
by plate counting in BHI agar (OXOID).

Samples of BHI broth cultures were collected after 24 h of incu-
bation, the O.D. was measured (in order to calculate the number
of CFU/mL), the cultures were centrifuged at 12000× g and the
cells were washed by resuspension in a solution of 0.85% NaCl
and centrifugation at 12000× g (three times). Finally, the cells
were suspended in the 0.85% NaCl solution to provide inocula
containing 109 CFU/mL.

PRELIMINARY QUALITATIVE TESTS FOR BIOGENIC AMINE
PRODUCTION
As a preliminary test of the capacity of the bacterial strains
to produce biogenic amines, the method described by Joosten
and Northolt (1987) was used. The culture medium used con-
tained tryptone (0.5%), yeast extract (0.5%), NaCl (0.5%), glu-
cose (0.1%), Tween 80 (0.05%), MgSO4 7H2O (0.02%), CaCO3

(0.01%), MnSO4 4H2O (0.005%), FeSO4 7H2O (0.004%), bac-
teriological agar (2%), and purple bromocresol (0.006%) as pH
indicator. The precursor amino acids of each biogenic amine (his-
tidine, lysine, ornithine, and tyrosine) were added individually to
the culture medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 2%. The ﬁnal pH
was adjusted to 5.5± 0.1, the medium was sterilized and distrib-
uted in Petri dishes. Plates of the culture medium containing each
one of the precursor amino acids were streaked, in order to obtain
individual colonies, with each bacterial strain. The plates were
incubated at 37˚C and examined after 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h of
incubation; a positive result was manifested by the appearance of
a purple halo around the colonies.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE BIOGENIC AMINES PRODUCED BY
THE BACTERIAL STRAINS
In a previous study (Lorenzo et al., 2008), the different biogenic
amines were quantiﬁed in the sausage units from which the micro-
bial strains tested in the present work were isolated. We observed
that in these sausages the putrescine and cadaverine were by far
the major biogenic amines. In order to quantify the production of
each biogenic amine (putrescine and cadaverine) by the different
bacterial strains, in each bacterial strain, and for each individ-
ual precursor amino acid (ornithine and lysine), 2 tubes (5 mL
each) of the culture medium (Joosten and Northolt, 1987) con-
taining 2% of the corresponding individual precursor amino acid
were each inoculated with 0.1 mL of a solution (0.85 g NaCl/L),
containing 108 CFU. The tubes, with a ﬁnal concentration of
2× 107 CFU/mL, were incubated at 37˚C for 72 h (previously,
quantiﬁcation of the biogenic amines was performed along 96 h
of growth, showing that for most strains maximum accumulation
took place after 72 h of incubation). After incubation, the O.D. was
measured in one tube, and the corresponding biogenic amine was
determined in the other. Firstly, 1 mL of 2 N HCl was added to
the tube in order to stop microbial growth and decarboxylation.
The content of the tube was then placed in a 25 mL volumetric
ﬂask, 1 mL of 1,7-diaminoheptane (internal standard) was added,
and the ﬁnal volume was made up with a 0.6 N HClO4 solution.
An aliquot (0.5 mL) of the mixture was then immediately placed
in a tube, and 100 μL of 2 N NaOH (to make the solution more
alkaline), 150 μL of a saturated solution of NaHCO3, and 1 mL of
dansyl chloride, were added consecutively. The tube was shaken
gently, and placed in a water bath at 40˚C for 45 min. In order to
remove residues of dansyl chloride, 50 μL of ammonia were then
added and the mixture was left to stand for 30 min. Finally, the
volume was made up to 2.5 mL with acetonitrile and the mixture
was ﬁltered (0.25 μm).

Separation, identiﬁcation, and quantiﬁcation of the biogenic
amines were carried out by HPLC, following the procedure
described by Eerola et al. (1993), using the equipment and
chromatographic conditions reported by Lorenzo et al. (2010).

A standard solution containing appropriate amounts of agma-
tine, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, hist-
amine, tyramine, spermidine, spermine, and 1,7-diaminoheptane
(as internal standard) was used to quantify the biogenic amines
present in the samples.

All the samples and standards were injected at least in duplicate
in different days. Repeatability tests were performed by injecting

a standard and a sample consecutively six times in a day. Repro-
ducibility tests were also carried out by injecting the standard and
the sample twice a day for 3 days, under the same experimental
conditions. There were no signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.05) in the
results obtained in these tests.

The quantity of each biogenic amine was expressed in milligram

per liter.

RESULTS
MOLECULAR TYPING OF THE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AND BACILLUS
STRAINS ISOLATED FROM TRADITIONAL SAUSAGES
The obtained resulting ﬁngerprints of the strains of Staphylococ-
cus and Bacillus used in the present study demonstrated that the
strains belonging to the same species were different. This is impor-
tant, because some strains belonging to the same species came from
the same sausage unit and could be the same.

DECARBOXYLASE ACTIVITY OF THE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AND BACILLUS
STRAINS ISOLATED FROM TRADITIONAL SAUSAGES
The decarboxylase activity of the Staphylococcus strains tested is
shown in Table 1. In this table, results reported in the literature
for the same species were summarized. The Staphylococcus strains
displayed a great variability in the histidine decarboxylase activity,
with 7 of the 15 strains of S. equorum (46.67%), 9 of the 11 strains
of S. epidermidis (81.82%), 6 of the 7 strains of S. saprophyticus
(85.71%), and 4 of the 5 strains of S. pasteuri (80%) displaying
this activity. The tyrosine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxy-
lase, and lysine decarboxylase activities were less variable. All

strains of S. saprophyticus displayed tyrosine, ornithine, and lysine
decarboxylase activities, whereas the frequency of the presence of
these activities was slightly lower in strains of S. equorum, S. epider-
midis, and S. pasteuri. Lysine was the amino acid decarboxylated
with a higher frequency; the 100% of the strains of S. equorum
and S. saprophyticus, the 91% of the strains of S. epidermidis and
the 80% of the strains of S. pasteuri were able to decarboxylate this
amino acid.

The decarboxylase activity observed in the Bacillus strains
tested is shown in Table 2. Of the 13 strains of B. subtilis studied,
10 displayed histidine decarboxylase activity (76.92%), 12 tyrosine
decarboxylase activity (92.31%), 8 ornithine decarboxylase activ-
ity (61.54%), and 8 lysine decarboxylase activity (61.54%). The
strains of B. amyloliquefaciens showed less variable behavior; of
the six strains studied, four were able to decarboxylate histidine
(66.72%), and six were able to decarboxylate tyrosine, ornithine,
and lysine (100%).

BIOGENIC AMINE ACCUMULATION AFTER 72 h OF GROWTH
The values of putrescine and cadaverine accumulated after 72 h of
growth by the strains of Staphylococcus and Bacillus, respectively
are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

The quantities of putrescine produced by the Staphylococcus
strains tested ranged from 1.46 to 1415.05 mg/L in S. equorum
(although one strain accumulated 1415.05 mg/L, the rest accu-
mulated less than 25 mg/L) and from 0.37 to 977.13 mg/L in S.
epidermidis (although one strain accumulated 977.13 mg/L, the
rest accumulated less than 15 mg/L). The strains of S. pasteuri

also produced variable quantities of putrescine, with concentra-
tions ranging between 1.19 and 12.39 mg/L. The strains of S.
saprophyticus generally produced less putrescine, at less variable
concentrations ranging from 0.43 to 1.91 mg/L.

Regarding the production of cadaverine, the quantities accu-
mulated were again very variable within the strains of S. equo-
rum (from 0.25 to 5.31 mg/L) and S. epidermidis (from 0.46 and
36.52 mg/L). A considerable variability was also registered within
the strains of S. saprophyticus (from 0.58 to 4.79 mg/L) and S.
pasteuri (from 0.40 to 4.33 mg/L).

The species that accumulated the highest amounts of putrescine
and cadaverine were S. equorum and S. epidermidis. One of the
strains of S. equorum accumulated 1415.05 mg/L of putrescine and

one of the strains of S. epidermidis displayed a high aminogenic
ability, accumulating 977.13 mg/L of putrescine or 36.52 mg/L of
cadaverine after 72 h of growth in the culture medium.

The Bacillus strains in the present study also displayed a high
degree of variability in their ability to produce putrescine and
cadaverine. In the strains of B. subtilis, the quantities accumulated
ranged from 0.39 to 18.43 mg/L for putrescine and from 0.43 to
4.29 mg/L for cadaverine. In the strains of B. amyloliquefaciens, the
quantities ranged from 0.76 to 3.27 mg/L for putrescine, and from
0.53 to 3.07 mg/L for cadaverine.

DISCUSSION
Information in the literature concerning the amino acid decar-
boxylase activity in strains of the genus Staphylococcus is scarce
and shows in general that microorganisms belonging to this genus
are not signiﬁcant possessors of these activities. Nonetheless, Silla
Santos (1998) reported a high frequency of histidine, tyrosine,
ornithine, and lysine decarboxylase activity in strains of S. xylosus
and S. saprophyticus isolated from Spanish fermented sausages,
which is in agreement with our results. Furthermore, Martín et al.
(2007) observed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities in
57% of the strains of S. xylosus isolated from Iberian dry-cured
sausages.

However, Drosinos et al. (2007) analyzed 300 staphylococci
strains isolated from traditional fermented Greek sausages and
observed that only a low proportion of strains displayed amino
acid decarboxylase activity. The species with the highest propor-
tion of strains that displayed histidine, tyrosine, ornithine, or lysine
decarboxylase activity were S. saprophyticus, S. simulans, and S.
xylosus, but within each species the proportion of strains that were
positive for a speciﬁc amino acid decarboxylase activity was never

Aminogenesis by Staphylococcus and Bacillus

greater than 50%. Martín et al. (2006) studying 239 Staphylococ-
cus strains isolated from fermented sausages reported that only
the 14.6% (35 strains) were able to decarboxylate one or more
amino acids. In this same way, Even et al. (2010) working with 129
strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from various
environments including cheeses and fermented sausages, observed
that only 5 strains (∼6%) were able to produce detectable amounts
of biogenic amines.

Bonomo et al. (2009) did not ﬁnd any tyrosine or ornithine
decarboxylase activity in any of the 37 staphylococci strains tested,
and only observed histidine decarboxylase activity in two strains of
S. warneri. As observed in the present study, lysine was the amino
acid most frequent decarboxylated, and 62% of strains, belong-
ing mainly to the S. equorum and S. xylosus species, were able to
decarboxylate this amino acid. In the latter study the highest pro-
portion of lysine-decarboxylating strains were in the S. pasteuri
and S. succinus species.

Masson et al. (1996) did not observe histidine decarboxylase
activity in any of the tested strains of S. carnosus, S. xylosus,
S. warneri, and S. saprophyticus isolated from sausages. They
observed tyrosine decarboxylase activity in all these strains, but the
amounts of tyramine produced never achieved 40 μg/mL. Bover-
Cid et al. (2001) did not observe any decarboxylase activity in any
of the staphylococci strains tested.

Information regarding the amino acid decarboxylase activity of
Bacillus strains isolated from meat products is very scarce. Roig-
Sagués et al. (1996) analyzed four strains of Bacillus spp. isolated
from salchichón (a Spanish traditional sausage) and found that
some of the strains displayed histidine decarboxylase activity and
were able to produce histamine, although in very low quantities
(about 0.5 μg/mL).

There is some information about Bacillus strains isolated from
salted and ripened Spanish anchovies. Hernández-Herrero et al.
(1999) reported that B. pumilus was able to produce histamine, but
in low quantities (12–17 μg/mL) and at low environmental NaCl
concentrations (0.5–3% NaCl); this ability disappeared at higher
concentrations of NaCl (10 and 20%).

Rodríguez-Jerez et al. (1994) analyzed 16 strains of Bacillus
spp. isolated from Spanish salted semi-preserved anchovies and
observed that none of the strains displayed ornithine or lysine
decarboxylase activity; the percentage of strains that displayed
histidine decarboxylase activity ranged from 75 to 81.25% depend-
ing on the culture medium (Niven or modiﬁed Niven) used in
the test. The quantities of histamine produced ranged from 0 to
10.54 μg/mL.

The aminogenic potential of the Staphylococcus and Bacillus
strains analyzed in the present study was generally low (quantities
produced lower than 25 mg/L for putrescine and lower than 5 mg/L
for cadaverine), with the exception of one strain of S. epidermidis

and one of S. equorum, which produced higher quantities. These
results therefore conﬁrm that the amino acid decarboxylase activ-
ities are not particularly high in species of the genera Staphylococ-
cus and Bacillus, especially when compared with other microbial
groups such as Enterobacteriaceae or lactic acid bacteria, present
in the fermented meat products (Bover-Cid et al., 2001; Lorenzo
et al., 2010).

In the literature, there is little available information on the
production of putrescine or cadaverine by Staphylococcus species.
Martín et al. (2006) observed the production of variable quantities
of putrescine (from 25 to >1000 mg/L) and cadaverine (from 25
to 1000 mg/L), being the strains of S. epidermidis the main pro-
ducers. Even et al. (2010) also reported the production of variable
quantities of putrescine (from 7 to 1499 mg/L) and cadaverine
(from 3 to 140 mg/L).

In the literature, there is no information about putrescine and
cadaverine production by species of the genus Bacillus, either from
meat products or other different origin.

The high variability in biogenic amine production within
strains belonging to the same species conﬁrms previous ﬁndings
(Bover-Cid and Holzapfel, 1999; Martín et al., 2006; Even et al.,
2010) and again shows that the amino acid decarboxylase activity
is a strain-dependant property. Although the aminogenic capacity
of these two bacterial genera is not usually very high, since they can
reach high counts in the sausages it is important to reduce their
counts by the implementation of rigorous hygienic measures, in
order to reduce the risk of accumulation of biogenic amines in the
ﬁnal products.

CONCLUSION
(a) Histidine, lysine, ornithine, and tyrosine decarboxylase activ-
ities were present in most of the strains of Staphylococcus and
Bacillus isolated from Spanish traditional sausages. However,
some variability was observed between strains, even within
the same species.

(b) The production of putrescine and cadaverine by the species
of Staphylococcus and Bacillus isolated from Spanish tradi-
tional sausages was in general low, with amounts accumulated
lower than 25 mg/L for putrescine and lower than 5 mg/L for
cadaverine. Only a strain of S. equorum produced 1415 mg/L
of putrescine and a strain of S. epidermidis accumulated
977 mg/L of putrescine and 36 mg/L of cadaverine.
