Kinesin-8s hang on by a tail

Accurate 

segregation  of  genetic 
material  into  two  daughter  cells 
is  essential  for  organism  reproduction, 
development,  and  survival.  The  cell 
assembles  a  macromolecular  structure 
called the mitotic spindle, which is com-
posed  of  dynamic  microtubules  (MTs) 
and many associated proteins that assem-
ble the spindle and drive the segregation 
of  the  chromosomes.  Members  of  the 
kinesin  superfamily  of  MT  associated 
proteins use the energy of ATP hydrolysis 
to help organize the spindle, to transport 
cargo within the spindle, and to regulate 
spindle  MT  dynamics.  The  Kinesin-8 
and  Kinesin-13  families  are  involved  in 
controlling mitotic spindle morphology, 
spindle  positioning,  and  chromosome 
movement.  While  both  kinesin  fami-
lies  are  MT  destabilizing  enzymes,  it  is 
unclear  whether  their  mechanisms  of 
MT  destabilization  are  mechanistically 
similar  or  how  they  act  to  destabilize 
MTs. Recently, three groups identified an 
additional  MT  binding  domain  within 
the tail of Kinesin-8s that is essential for 
their  roles  in  regulating  MT  dynamics 
and chromosome positioning.

Properly  regulated  microtubule  (MT) 
dynamics  are  critical  for  assembly  of  the 
mitotic spindle and for the precise align-
ment and segregation of chromosomes into 
two daughter cells.1 Spindle components, 
such  as  MT  associated  proteins  (MAPs) 
and  motor  proteins,  have  been  identified 
as  cytoplasmic  factors  that  can  regulate 
the dynamics of MTs through either sta-
bilization  or  destabilization  mechanisms. 
Two  important  classes  of  kinesins,  the 
Kinesin-13  and  Kinesin-8  families,  play 
essential  roles  in  destabilizing  MTs  and 
highlight  the  diverse  mechanisms  that 

cells  use  to  provide  temporal  and  spatial 
control over the MT cytoskeleton. A series 
of recent papers have provided significant 
new insight into how these different kine-
sins control MT dynamics.2-4

Members  of  the  Kinesin-13  family 
control  the  dynamics  of  both  astral  and 
kinetochore MTs, are required for bipolar 
spindle formation, for chromosome align-
ment, and to prevent or correct errors in 
the  attachment  of  chromosomes  to  the 
spindle.5,6  Biochemically,  the  Kinesin-13 
family members do not walk along MTs, 
but rather they are potent MT depolymer-
ases that enrich on MT ends and induce 
a conformational change at the protofila-
ment end that leads to MT depolymeriza-
tion.7,8 In contrast, Kinesin-8 proteins are 
plus-end  directed  motors  and  plus-end 
specific  MT  destabilizing  enzymes.9-12 
The  functions  of  Kinesin-8s  are  diverse 
and  include  proposed  roles  in  spindle 
assembly,13 spindle positioning,14,15 spindle 
length  control,16  chromosome  position-
ing,10,17-19  and  anaphase  chromosome 
segregation.20,21 Despite all of these func-
tional studies, the mechanisms by which 
Kinesin-8s control MT dynamics are not 
understood.

The  most 

significant  mechanistic 
insights  into  the  Kinesin-8  family  have 
come  from  studies  on  the  budding  yeast 
Kinesin-8 Kip3, which showed that these 
motors are MT plus-end directed motors 
that  have  a  preference  for  destabilizing 
long MTs as opposed to shorter MTs.9,11,12 
From  these  studies,  it  was  proposed  that 
the MT length dependent destabilization 
induced  by  Kinesin-8s  is  proportional  to 
the number of Kinesin-8 motors that are 
bound to the MT. In this model, motors 
are able to randomly bind to a MT, where 
the number of motors bound to a MT at a

without  dissociating)  and  concentrate  in 
a gradient dependent manner at the plus 
ends of MTs where the motors cooperate to 
induce  MT  destabilization.12,24  Cryo-EM 
studies  of  the  motor  domain  bound  to 
MTs  showed  that  Kinesin-8  motors  can 
bind  adjacently  along  protofilaments  to 
stabilize a curved structure,25 suggesting a 
mechanism in which multiple Kinesin-8s 
accumulate  at  the  plus  end  of  a  MT  to 
induce  depolymerization  by  stabilizing 
the bent structure of the MT. In addition, 
three groups recently showed that the tail 
domains  of  Kip3  and  Kif18A  possess  an 
ATP-independent  MT  binding  domain 
that binds to MTs in vivo and in vitro and 
is  important  for  proper  localization  and 
function of the molecule.2-4 These studies 
are  helping  us  understand  what  features 
of  Kinesin-8  proteins  are  conserved  and 
what features are different to allow them 
to carry out diverse functions on control-
ling the MT array.

Longer  mitotic  spindles  observed  in 
Kip3  deletion  strains21  suggest  that  Kip3 
affects  parameters  of  dynamic  instabil-
ity,  where  deletion  of  Kip3  resulted  in  a 
decrease  in  MT  catastrophe  frequency 
and a reduction of time MTs remained in 
a  paused  state  (MTs  are  neither  growing 
nor shortening).9 This result suggests that 
Kip3 has the ability to destabilize MTs by 
increasing the frequency of catastrophes as 
well as to stabilize MTs by preventing the 
addition or loss of MT polymer. Su et al.3 
were interested in understanding how the 
destabilizing and stabilizing effects of the 
yeast Kip3 were coordinated. The authors 
generated  a  yeast  strain  that  expressed 
only a tailless version of Kip3 and found 
that these cells exhibited resistance to the 
MT  destabilizing  drug  benomyl,  similar 
to  Kip3  knockout  cells,  suggesting  that 
without  the  tail  domain  MTs  are  more 
stable due to ineffective Kip3. Using puri-
fied  versions  of  Kip3  in  single  molecule 
tracking  experiments,  the  authors  dem-
onstrated that the tail domain of Kip3 is 
important for processivity, increased MT 
plus-end dwell time, and MT depolymer-
ization. From their studies they proposed 
a  model  whereby  Kip3  utilizes  its  highly 
processive  motor  domain  to  translocate 
itself to the MT plus end. Plus-end accu-
mulation  is  achieved  by  the  strong  asso-
ciation with the MT end mediated by the 

Figure 1. Schematic of Kinesin-8 motors binding and walking along a mt toward the plus end. 
Over time, Kinesin-8 motors accumulate and dwell at the plus end of the mt. Once properly local-
ized, Kinesin-8 motors stabilize a curved protofilament conformation until enough motors have 
accumulated, and the mt undergoes a catastrophe. it is possible that as motors accumulate and 
stabilize the curved conformation the net effect would be to act as a capping protein wherein 
tubulin subunits are neither gained nor lost from the mt end.

given  time  is  proportional  to  the  length 
of the MT. Kinesin-8 proteins with high 
processivity  are  able  to  reach  and  accu-
mulate at the MT plus end where a con-
centration gradient is formed, resulting in 
the depolymerization of long MTs.11 This 
concentration gradient is also proposed to 
be important in how Kinesin-8s act coop-
eratively in destabilizing MTs.12

In  contrast  to  the  situation  in  bud-
ding  yeast,  results  in  other  systems  are 
contradictory  regarding  the  mechanisms 

by  which  Kinesin-8  proteins  contribute 
to  MT  destabilization.  In  fission  yeast, 
Klp5/6 are proposed to be MT destabiliz-
ing enzymes in vivo,20,22 but they do not 
actively  depolymerize  MTs  in  vitro.23  In 
mammalian  cells,  some  studies  showed 
that  the  Kinesin-8  Kif18A  can  directly 
depolymerize  MTs,10  while  other  reports 
suggest that it is a MT plus-end capping 
protein.24 Studies on all Kinesin-8s agree 
that  these  motors  are  highly  processive

tively  induce  MT  depolymerization.  The 
tail  also  has  a  second  role  in  mediating 
MT  stabilization  along  the  length  of  the 
MT, which will in turn allow more Kip3 
to  accumulate  at  the  MT  plus-ends  and 
destabilize the MTs.

Studies  on  the  mammalian  ortholog 
Kif18A, also demonstrated that it utilizes 
its tail to increase motor processivity and 
MT  plus-end  dwell  time.2  In  addition, 
human  cells  expressing  a  tailless  Kif18A 
construct are unable to localize this tailless 
Kif18A properly to the plus ends of MTs, 
decrease the length of the spindle, or sup-
press chromosome oscillations in compari-
son to overexpressed full-length Kif18A.2,4 
These studies suggest that the tail domain 
of  Kinesin-8s  is  required  to  tether  the 
molecule to the MT plus ends where the 
motors are able to accumulate in order to 
promote  MT  destabilization.  Consistent 
with this hypothesis, mathematical mod-
eling  using  dynamic  MTs  suggests  that 
high  processivity  and  an  increased  dwell 
time at the MT plus ends are required for 
dampening  of  MT  dynamics,  resulting 
in  a  population  of  short  MTs  compared 
with conditions without an added motor.4 
Together these studies suggest that unlike 
Kinesin-13s that promote MT destabiliza-
tion by increasing the frequency of catas-
trophe  (transition  from  MT  growth  to 
shrinkage), Kinesin-8 motors likely act in 
a cooperative fashion such that sufficient 
amounts of protein need to accumulate at 
the MT plus end in order to promote MT 
destabilization (Fig. 1).

Based  on  what 

is  known  about 
Kinesin-8s,  one  might  speculate  whether 
Kinesin-8  proteins  are  truly  depolymer-
ases  or  perhaps  just  motor  proteins  that 
can  alter  multiple  MT  dynamics  param-
eters  in  order  to  adjust  the  length  of  the 
MT. Unlike Kinesin-13s that bind to the 
end  of  the  MT  and  immediately  induce 
catastrophe,7  accumulation  of  Kinesin-8 
proteins  is  necessary  to  promote  MT 
destabilization.12  Multiple  studies  have 
shown that Kinesin-8s in different organ-
isms accumulate at the plus end of the MT 
where  the  motor  dwells  for  lengthy  peri-
ods of time.12,24 Even though a Kinesin-8 
molecule dwells at the plus end of a proto-
filament, it is not actively depolymerizing 
the MT, suggesting that multiple motors 

are  needed  to  be  positioned  on  adjacent 
protofilaments  in  order  to  destabilize  a 
MT.12  In  addition,  Kip3  is  a  less  robust 
depolymerase  compared  with  MCAK, 
which depolymerizes MTs at a rate almost 
two-fold faster.11,26 Kip3 has a maximum 
depolymerization  rate  for  longer  MTs, 
and  as  the  MT  becomes  shorter  the  rate 
of  depolymerization  decreases;  whereas, 
the  depolymerization  rate  for  MCAK 
does  not  change  in  a  length  dependent 
manner.11 These observations suggest that 
instead of robust MT depolymerases that 
induce MT catastrophes like Kinesin-13s, 
Kinesin-8s  are  motors  that  “tune”  MTs 
to a specific length in order to destabilize 
MTs. This idea is consistent with the pre-
dictions of computational modeling stud-
ies, which suggest that while the net effect 
of adding either Kinesin-13s or Kinesin-8s 
to a population of dynamic MTs leads to 
shorter average MT lengths, the amount of 
Kinesin-8 proteins required for the effect 
exceeds that of the Kinesin-13 proteins.4

It  is  also  interesting  to  speculate  how 
the tails of kinesins evolved their unique 
roles.  Different  kinesin  families  utilize 
their  tail  domains  to  perform  multiple 
functions  on  the  MT  cytoskeleton.  For 
most  kinesins,  the  tail  domain  has  been 
viewed  as  the  cargo-binding  domain;27 
however,  depending  on  the  kinesin,  the 
tail sometimes perform regulatory roles as 
well. In conventional kinesin (Kinesin-1), 
the  tail  domain  interacts  with  the  motor 
domain to keep the motor in a closed con-
formation  until  it  interacts  with  cargo.28 
For the Kinesin-14 proteins, there is a sec-
ond MT binding site in the tail domain,29 
which  allows  Kinesin-14s  to  cross-link 
MTs.30,31  This  tail-binding  site  can  also 
be  utilized  as  a  regulatory  domain  when 
bound  by  importin  α/β  to  prevent  MT 
cross-linking in areas of low Ran-GTP.32 
Interestingly, while the Kinesin-8 proteins 
contain  a  tail  domain,  not  all  Kinesin-8 
proteins  use  that  tail  as  a  second  MT 
binding  domain.  The  human  paralog  of 
Kif18A,  Kif18B,  contains  a  binding  site 
for the MT plus-end binding protein EB1 
within  the  tail  domain,  suggesting  that 
Kif18B  uses  an  indirect  mechanism  to 
target to MT ends. Association of Kif18B 
with  EB1  is  required  for  its  localization 
and for its ability to destabilize astral MT 
plus  ends.33,34  One  interesting  question 

is  why  two  different  Kinesin-8  proteins 
would  use  distinct  mechanisms  to  target 
to MT plus ends. One hypothesis is that 
Kif18A needs MTs with sufficient stabil-
ity, such as the bundles of MTs that com-
pose  the  kinetochore-fiber,  in  order  for 
the motor to accumulate at the plus ends 
before  that  MT  would  undergo  depoly-
merization  through  dynamic 
instabil-
ity.  In  contrast,  Kif18B  acts  on  the  plus 
ends of the more dynamic astral MTs, so 
maybe  EB1  somehow  marks  those  MTs 
as being more stable, and thus allows for 
Kif18B to accumulate sufficiently to regu-
late  their  dynamics.  Another  interesting 
question is why Kip3 is the only Kinesin-8 
that  has  MT  depolymerizing  activity  in 
vitro. Because budding yeast do not con-
tain Kinesin-13 motors, Kip3 may be an 
enzyme that possesses the ability to depo-
lymerize MTs at the onset of mitosis and 
then modulate MT dynamics through its 
ability to also stabilize MTs.

While these studies answer important 
questions about the conservation of mech-
anism  between  the  Kinesin-8  proteins, 
they  leave  several  questions  unanswered. 
First, it is unclear what parameters of MT 
dynamics are altered by Kif18A and other 
Kinesin-8  proteins  during  mitosis  and 
whether  depletion  of  Kif18A  will  affect 
multiple  parameters  of  dynamic  instabil-
ity similarly to knockout of Kip3. From a 
mechanistic standpoint, it will be interest-
ing to determine how stabilizing MTs in 
a  curved  conformation  by  the  Kinesin-8 
motor domain induces MT instability. In 
addition,  it  will  be  important  to  recon-
stitute  dynamic  MTs  with  the  Kinesin-8 
proteins  to  see  what  aspects  of  dynamic 
instability  are  regulated.  Finally,  a  major 
question is why do higher eukaryotes have 
both  Kinesin-13s  and  Kinesin-8s  (7  pro-
teins in all) to regulate MT dynamics when 
yeast can get by with just Kip3. Dissecting 
the unique aspects of these motors will be 
informative  for  understanding  how  the 
dynamic  MT  cytoskeleton  is  involved  in 
diverse cellular processes.
