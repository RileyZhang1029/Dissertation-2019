ABSTRACT

This  study  was  conducted  to  define  the  underlying  mechanism  of  hypophagia  in-
duced  by  increased  central  serotonergic  action.  Rats  received  3  daily  injections  of 
5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan  (5-HTP),  a  serotonin  precursor,  at  a  dose  of  100  mg/kg/10  ml 
saline  at  1  h  before  lights  off.  A  significant  suppression  in  food  intake  was  observed 
shortly  after  the  5-HTP  injection  and  persisted  during  3  daily  5-HTP  injections.  Neu-
ropeptide  Y  (NPY)  expression  in  the  arcuate  nucleus  increased  after  3  days  of  5-HTP 
treatment,  as  high  as  in  the  pair-fed  group.  Immunoreactivity  of  phosphorylated  ex-
tracellular  signal-regulated  protein  kinase  (pERK1/2)  in  the  hypothalamic  paraventricular 
nucleus  (PVN)  was  increased  markedly  by  3  days  of  5-HTP  treatment,  but  not  by  3 
days  of  pair-fed.  mRNA  expression  levels  of  serotonin  reuptake  transporter  (5-HTT) 
was  increased  in  the  dorsal  raphe  nucleus  of  the  5-HTP  treated  rats,  but  not  in  the 
pair-fed  group.  Results  suggest  that  increased  pERK1/2  in  the  PVN  of  5-HTP  injected 
rats  may  be  a  part  of  serotonergic  anorectic  signaling,  perhaps  blunting  the  orectic 
action  of  NPY;  i.e.,  5-HTP  injected  rats  showed  hypophagia  despite  of  increased  NPY 
expression  in  the  arcuate  nucleus.

INTRODUCTION

    Serotonin,  5-hydroxytrypamine  (5-HT),  known  to 
play  a  role  in  feeding  behavior  as  an  anorectic 
molecule  (Curzon,  1990)  has  been  implicated  in  the

processes  of  within-meal  satiation  and  post-meal 
satiety  (Halford  and  Blundell,  2000).  The  hypo-
thalamus  appears  to  be  where  5-HT  exerts  its 
anorectic  effect  in  the  central  control  of  feeding, 
perhaps,  at  least  partly,  through  its  interaction  with 
the  hypothalamic  feeding  peptides.  It  has  been 
reported  that  5-HT  exhibits  a  negative  correlation 
with  neuropeptide  Y  (NPY),  a  potent  orexigenic 
molecule,  in  the  hypothalamus  (Dryden  et  al.,  1995; 
1996;  Jahng  et  al.,  1998b;  Currie  et  al.,  2002).  We 

that 

level  of  pERK1/2 

tetralin,  a  5-HT1A 

have  previously  reported 
the  hypothalamic 
expression  of  NPY  was  significantly  decreased  in 
anorectic  (anx/anx)  mouse  showing  drastic  acti-
vation  of  the  central  5-HT  system  (Jahng  et  al., 
1998b).  Previous  studies  reported  that  metergoline, 
a  5-HT1/5-HT2  receptor  antagonist,  and  8-hydroxy- 
2-(di-n-propylamino) 
receptor 
agonist,  enhances  food  consumption  (Coscina  et 
al.,  1994;  Currie  and  Coscina,  1996;  Voigt  et  al., 
2002),  and  that  5-HT1A  receptor  immunoreactivity 
is  observed  in  the  hypothalamic  arcuate  neurons 
containing  NPY  (Collin  et  al.,  2002).  Taken  to-
gether,  it  is  suggested  that  anorexic  effects  of 
the  brain  5-HT  system  may  comprise  decreased 
NPYergic  activity  in  the  hypothalamus. 
    NPY  dose-dependently  increased  cellular  level  of 
phosphorylated  extracellular  signal-regulated  protein 
kinase  (pERK1/2)  in  cultured  cells  (Gur  et  al.,  2002). 
It  has  been  shown  that  food  deprivation  increases 
neuronal 
the  hypothalamic 
paraventricular  nucleus  (PVN)  of  mice  (Ponsalle  et 
al.,  1992)  and  rat  (Ueyama  et  al.,  2004;  Lee  et  al., 
2010).  Food  deprivation  increases  not  only  NPY 
mRNA  expression  in  the  arcuate  nucleus  (Brady  et 
al.,  1990;  Swart  et  al.,  2002;  Kim  et  al.,  2005;  Lee 
et  al.,  2010)  but  also  release  in  the  PVN  (Dube  et 
al.,  1992;  Yoshihara  et  al.,  1996).  Neurons  in  the 
PVN  are  richly  supplied  by  axons  of  NPY  neurons 
from  the  arcuate  nucleus  (Elmquist  et  al.,  1998; 
1999).  Thus,  if  the  PVN  neurons  are  second  order 
effectors  located  downstream  of  the  arcuate  nu-
cleus,  pERK1/2  could,  possibly,  be  a  part  of  NPY 
downstream  signaling  cascade  in  the  PVN  during 
food  deprivation.
    In  order  to  determine  if  pERK1/2  is  a  putative 
downstream  effecter  of  NPY  signaling  in  the  hy-
pothalamic  PVN,  possibly  related  with  increased 
brain  5-HT  level,  5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan  (5-HTP),  a 
5-HT  precursor,  was  administrated  to  rats  to  in-
crease  the  brain  5-HT  level  (Gartside  et  al.,  1992; 
Yamada  et  al.,  2000;  Choi  et  al.,  2003).

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Animals

    Adult  male  Sprague-Dawley  rats  (250∼300  g, 
Daehanbiolink  Co.,  Korea)  were 
individually  ac-
climated  to  the  standard  laboratory  conditions  (12  h 

pERK  in  the  Serotonin-induced  Hypophagia 133

light-dark  cycle,  light  on  at  9:00  AM)  with  free 
access  to  standard  laboratory  food  (Purina  Rodent 
Chow,  Purina  Co.,  Seoul,  Korea)  and  water  ad 
libitum.  Animals  were  cared  according 
to  The 
Guideline  for  Animal  Experiments,  2000,  edited  by 
The  Korean  Academy  of  Medical  Sciences,  which  is 
consistent  with  NIH  Guideline  for  the  Care  and  Use 
of  Laboratory  Animals,  1996  revised. 

Drug  treatments

injected  or 

    Rats  were  divided  into  three  treatment  groups 
(n=6/group/time  point),  such  as  the  control,  the 
5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan  (5-HTP;  100  mg/kg/10  ml, 
dissolved  in  sterile  physiologic  saline;  Sigma  Co., 
MO,  USA) 
the  pair-fed  group.  The 
5-HTP  group  received  a  single  intraperitoneal  in-
jection  of  5-HTP  at  1  h  before  lights  off  or  three 
daily  injections  at  9:00  AM  every  morning.  The 
control  group  received  the  same  volume  of  saline 
instead  of  5-HTP  at  each  time  point.  The  pair-fed 
group  was  provided  with  the  same  amount  of  food 
consumed  by  5-HTP  rats.  Rats  were  sacrificed  at  2 
or  8  h  after  the  single  injection  of  5-HTP,  or  24  h 
after  the  last  injection  of  daily  5-HTP.  Total  48  rats 
(18  control,  18  5-HTP,  and  12  pair-fed)  were  hired 
for  this  study. 

In  situ  hybridization 

    Rats  were  anesthetized  with  an  overdose  of 
sodium  pentobarbital.  Once  unresponsive, 
trans-
cardiac  perfusion  was  performed  with  heparinized 
isotonic  saline  containing  0.5%  NaNO2,  then  with 
4%  paraformaldehyde  in  0.1  M  sodium  phosphate 
buffer.  The  brains  were  rapidly  dissected,  blocked, 
post-fixed  for  3  h,  and  transferred  into  30%  sucrose 
for  24  h  for  cryoprotection.  Forty-micron  coronal 
sections  were  cut  on  a  freezing  sliding  microtome. 
Every  other  sections  through  the  rostral-caudal  ex-

tent  of  the  hypothalamus  (between  bregma  −1.80 
mm  and  −3.80  mm;  Paxinos  and  Watson,  1986) 
and  the  raphe  nucleus  (between  bregma  −7.64 
mm  and  −8.80  mm;  Paxions  and  Watson,  1986) 

were  collected  into  20  ml  glass  scintillation  vials 
containing  ice-cold  2×SSC  (0.3  M  NaCl,  0.03  M  Na 
Citrate)  for  in  situ  hybridization.  The  SSC  was 
pipetted  off,  and  sections  were  suspended  in  1  ml 
of  prehybridization  buffer  (50%  formamide,  10%  dex-
tran  sulfate,  2×SSC,  1×Denhardt's  solution,  50  mM

was  performed  with  radioactively 
labeled  cDNA 
probes  of  NPY  (Jahng  et  al.,  1998b;  for  the  arcuate 
sections)  or  serotonin  reuptake  transporter  (5-HTT, 
Jahng  et  al.,  1998a;  for  the  raphe  sections)  as  we 
previously  described  (Choi  et  al.,  2003).  The  tissue 
sections  were 
then  mounted  on  gelatin-subbed 
slides,  air-dried,  and  apposed  to  Kodak  BioMax  film 
(Eastman  Kodak  Co.,  NY,  USA)  at  4oC.  Exposure 
times  varied  from  12  to  48  h  to  obtain  auto-
radiographic  images  within  a  linear  range  of  optical 
density  after  development  in  Kodak  D-19  developer. 
In  situ  hybridization  was  carried  out  on  the  re-

    Free-floating  tissue  sections  were  washed  twice 
for  15  min  in  0.1  M  sodium  phosphate  buffered 
saline  (PBS),  and 
in  0.2% 
Triton,  1%  bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA)  in  PBS  for 
30  min.  After  washing  twice  in  PBS-BSA,  sections 
were  incubated  overnight  with  anti-rabbit  phospho- 
p44/42  MAPK  (Thr202/Tyr204)  antibody  (1：300 
dilution,  Cell  signaling,  Beverly,  MA,  USA).  Sections 
were  washed  in  PBS-BSA  twice  and  incubated  for 
1  h  with  biotinylated  anti-rabbit-goat  antibody  (Vec-
tor  Laboratories,  CA,  USA);  bound  secondary  anti-
body  was  then  amplified  with  commercial  ABC  kit 
(Vectastain  Elite  Kit,  Vector  Laboratories,  CA,  USA). 
Antibody  complexes  were  visualized  by  a  5  min 
0.05%  diaminobenzadine  reaction.  Immunostained 
sections  were  mounted  onto  gelatin-coated  slides, 
air  dried  overnight,  consequently  dehydrated  throu-
gh  a  graded  ethanol  to  xylene,  and  then  cover-
slipped  with  Permount.

Quantitative  and  statistical  analysis

    Images  on  the  autoradiographic  films  were  di-
gitized  with  a  Zeiss  Stemi-2000  stereoscope  at-
tached  to  a  Dage-MTI  CCD  72  camera  and  MCID 
image  analysis  system  (MCID,  Imaging  Research 
Inc.,  Ontario,  Canada).  Tissue  levels  of  NPY,  5-HTT 
mRNA,  or  pERK  were  determined  by  quantifying 
the  mean  relative  optical  density  of  pixels  with 
densities  of  at  least  2  S.D.  above  the  mean  density 

of  the  image  background  (mRNA  or  protein  pixels). 
For  each  section,  the  mean  background  value  was 
subtracted  from  the  mean  pixel  value.  The  pixel 
values  were  averaged  across  three  sections  from 
each  individual  rat  and  then  the  average  value  of 
each  rat  averaged  across  all  rats  in  each  ex-
perimental  group.  All  the  data  was  analyzed  by  one 
way  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  and  preplanned 
comparisons  with  the  control  were  performed  by 
post-hoc  Fisher’s  PLSD  test  or  unpaired  t-test  using 
StatView  software  (Abacus,  Berkeley,  CA).  Sig-
nificance  was  set  at  p＜0.05,  and  all  values  were 
presented  as  means±SEM.

RESULTS

    Rats  received  an  intraperitoneal  injection  of  5- 
HTP  (100  mg/kg/10  ml  saline)  or  saline  at  1  h 
before  lights  off,  and  the  spontaneous  feeding  with 
ad  libitum  access  to  food  (standard  rodent  chow) 
and  water  for  2  or  8  h  were  measured.  Food  intake 
of  5-HTP  injected  rats  decreased  significantly  (p＜ 
0.05)  compared  with  the  saline  injected  controls  at 
both  time  points  (Fig.  1A).  Cumulative  food  intake 
was  suppressed  persistently  (p＜0.05  vs.  saline  on 
each  day)  during  3  daily  administrations  of  5-HTP 
(Fig.  1B).  Weight  losses  in  5-HTP  rats  compared 
with  saline  controls  appeared  to  be  more  severe 
than  in  its  pair-fed  group  (Fig.  1C). 
    mRNA  expression  levels  of  5-HT  reuptake  trans-
porter  5-HTT  in  the  dorsal  raphe  nucleus,  where 
most  of  5-HT  neurons  in  the  brain  are  located, 
were  examined  after  3  days  of  5-HTP  treatment 
when  not  only  the  5-HTP  group  but  also  the  pair- 
fed  group  showed  significant  reductions  in  body 
weight  compared  to  their  saline  controls.  5-HTT 
mRNA  levels  increased  in  the  5-HTP  treated  group 
(p＜0.05),  but  not  in  its  pair-fed  group,  as  com-
pared  with 
free-fed  saline  group  (Fig.  2), 
suggesting  an  increased  5-HTergic  activity  in  the 
brain  by  5-HTP  injections,  but  not  by  pair-feeding. 
    A  single  injection  of  5-HTP  appeared  not  to 
acutely  affect  NPY  mRNA  expression  levels  in  the 
arcuate  nucleus;  i.e.,  the  arcuate  NPY  mRNA  level 
did  not  differ  from  the  saline  group  at  2  or  8  h  after 
a  single  injection  (Fig.  3).  Three  days  of  5-HTP 
treatment  significantly  increased  NPY  expression 
levels  in  the  arcuate  nucleus  (p＜0.05  vs.  saline),

and  this  increase  was  also  observed  by  3  days  of

loss.

    We  have  demonstrated

suggesting  that  anorexia  by  5-HTP  injections  is  due 
to  increased  5-HTergic  activities  in  the  brain  regions 
(Choi  et  al.,  2003).  Weight  losses  in  5-HTP  injected 
rats  appeared  to  be  bigger  than  in  its  pair-fed 
group,  consistently  with  our  previous  report  (Choi  et 
al.,  2003),  suggesting  an  additional  anorectic  effect

5-HT  may  increase  the  resting  energy  expenditure 
(Leibowitz  and  Alexander,  1998;  Walsh  et  al., 
1999).  That  is,  not  only  decreased  energy  intake 
but  also  increased  energy  expenditure  may  con-
tribute  to  the  weight  loss  by  systemic  5-HTP. 
    In  this  study,  5-HTT  mRNA  expression  in  the 
dorsal  raphe  nucleus  was  increased  by  3  days  of 
5-HTP  treatment,  but  not  by  3  days  of  pair-fed 
(food  restriction).  Previous  studies  have  reported 
that  long-term  food  restriction  decreases  the  brain 
density  (Huether,  1999)  and  expression  levels  of 
5-HTT  (Haider  and  Haleem,  2000;  Jahng  et  al., 
2007),  and  that  the  depletion  of  brain  5-HT  with 
chronic  para-chlorophenylalanine  treatment  decreas-
es  5-HTT  mRNA  expression  in  the  raphe  nucleus 
(Linnet  et  al.,  1995;  Yu  et  al.,  1995).  Also,  we  have 
reported  that  increased  5-HTT  mRNA  expression  in 
the  raphe  nucleus  by  3  daily  5-HTP  injections  is 
accompanied  with  increased  5-HT  levels  in  the 
brain  regions  (Choi  et  al.,  2003).  Thus,  it  is  con-
cluded  that  increased  5-HTT  mRNA  expression  in 
the  dorsal  raphe  of  5-HTP  treated  rats  may  not  be 
a  consequence  of  reduced  food  intake  and  weight 
loss,  and  it  reveals  an  increased  5-HTergic  activity,

likely  due  to  increased  5-HT  levels  in  the  brain 
regions. 
    Previous  studies  have  reported  that  5-HT  exhibits 
a  negative  correlation  with  NPY  in  the  hypotha-
lamus  (Dryden  et  al.,  1995;  1996;  Jahng  et  al., 
1998b;  Currie  et  al.,  2002),  suggesting  that  anorexic 
effects  of  the  brain  5-HT  system  may  comprise 
decreased  NPYergic  activity  in  the  hypothalamus. 
However,  in  this  study,  NPY  mRNA  expression  the 
arcuate  nucleus  markedly  increased  after  3  daily 
injection  of  5-HTP  when  the  hypothalamic  5-HT 
level  increased  (Choi  et  al.,  2003).  Although  a 
single  injection  of  5-HTP  instantly  increased  the 
hypothalamic  5-HT  levels  (Choi  et  al.,  2003),  the 
arcuate  NPY  expression  was  not  acutely  affected 
by  a  single  5-HTP  injection  in  this  study,  suggesting 
that 
the  arcuate 
nucleus  with  3  daily  injections  of  5-HTP  is  not  a 
direct  effect  of  increased  5-HT  neurotransmission  in 
the  hypothalamus.  Meanwhile,  the  arcuate  NPY 
expression  was 
the  pair-fed  (food 
restriction)  group  as  much  as  in  the  3  daily  5-HTP 
group.  A  negative  energy  balance,  such  as  food

concluded  that  the  increased  NPY  expression  in  the 
arcuate  nucleus  of  5-HTP  treated  rats  is  a  con-
sequence  of  decreased  food  intake,  a  negative 
energy  balance,  rather  than  of  increased  5-HTergic 
activity

NPY,  a  potent  orexic  peptide,  stimulates  feeding 
(Stanley  and  Leibowitz,  1985;  Kalra  et  al.,  1999; 
Schwartz  et  al.,  2000),  and  increased  NPY  ex-
pression  in  the  arcuate  nucleus  correlates  with 
obese  phenotype;  i.e.,  increased  food  intake  and 
weight  gain  (Sancora  et  al.,  1990;  Kowalski  et  al., 
1999).  However,  food  intake  of  5-HTP  injected  rats 
was  persistently  suppressed  despite  of

creased  NPY  expression  in  the  arcuate  nucleus, 
suggesting 
tentative  orectic  action  by 
increased  hypothalamic  NPY  is  inhibited  in  the 
5-HTP  injected  rats.  Also,  it  should  be  noticed  that 
a  single  injection  of  5-HTP  instantly  suppressed 
food  intake  (Choi  et  al.,  2003),  but  not  acutely 
affected  the  arcuate  NPY  expression  in  this  study. 
Thus,  it  is  hypothesized  that  the  anorectic  action  by 
increased  5-HTergic  activity  in  the  hypothalamus  is 
not  mediated  by  decreased  NPY  expression  in  the 
arcuate  nucleus,  but  it  may  comprise  a  blunted 
orectic  signaling  of  NPY 
the  paraventricular 
nucleus  where 
the  arcuate  NPY 
neurons  are  richly  supplied  (Elmquist  et  al.,  1998; 
1999;  Schwartz  et  al.,  2000). 
    In  vitro  study  demonstrated  that  NPY  dose-de-
pendently  increases  cellular  level  of  pERK1/2  in 
cultured  cells  (Gur  et  al.,  2002).  In  vivo  studies  have 
shown  that  food  deprivation  increases  not  only  NPY 
release  (Dube  et  al.,  1992;  Yoshihara  et  al.,  1996) 
but  also  the  neuronal  level  of  pERK1/2  in  the 
hypothalamic  PVN  (Ponsalle  et  al.,  1992;  Ueyama 
et  al.,  2004;  Lee  et  al.,  2010).  These  studies 
suggest  that  NPY  signaling  cascade  in  the  PVN 
neurons  may  involve  the  activation  of  ERK1/2,  and 
this  idea  seemed  to  be  further  supported  by  the 
present  result  demonstrating  that  pERK1/2  level  is 
increased 
the  PVN  when  NPY  expression 
increased  in  the  arcuate  nucleus  following  3  daily 
injections  of  5-HTP.  However,  in  the  pair-fed  group, 
the  PVN-pERK1/2  level  did  not  increase  despite  a 
significant

arcuate  nucleus.  We  have  previously  shown  that

intracerebroventricular  injection  of  NPY,  although  it 
stimulated  feeding,  did  not  increase  pERK1/2  level 
in  the  PVN  (Lee  et  al.,  2010).  Thus,  it  is  suggested 
that  pERK1/2  may  not  be  a  downstream  signaling 
of  increased  NPYergic  activity  in  the  PVN  of  5-HTP 
injected  rats.  Previous  studies  have  supported  the 
idea 
increased  5-HTergic  activity  may  be 
implicated  in  the  pERK1/2  increase  in  the  PVN  of 
5-HTP 
the 
5-HT1A  receptor  resulted  in  ERK  activation  in  cell 
lines  (Millan  et  al.,  2001)  and 
injections  with 
5-HT1A  agonists  increased  pERK1/2  level  in  the  rat 
PVN  (Sullivan  et  al.,  2005;  Crane  et  al.,  2007), 
suggesting  that  5-HT1A  receptors  may  stimulate 
pERK1/2  levels  in  the  PVN.  Neurons  expressing 
5-HT1A  receptors  are  observed  in  the  PVN  (Marvin 
et.  al.,  2010).  Currie  and  Coscina  (1996)  demon-
strated  that  intra-PVN  injections  of  metergoline,  a 
5-HT1/5-HT2  receptor  antagonist,  antagonize  the 
hypophagia  following  5-HT  injections  into  the  PVN. 
We  have  observed  that  ketanserin,  a  5-HT2A/2C 
antagonist,  although  it  abolished  the  hypophagia  by 
5-HTP  injections,  did  not  block  the  pERK1/2  in-
crease 
(unpublished  data).  A  5- 
HT2A/2C  agonist  DOI  attenuated  NPY-induced 
feeding  and  this  was  antagonized  by  ketanserin 
(Currie  et  al.,  2002).  Thus,  it  is  concluded  that 
increased  pERK1/2  level  in  the  PVN  of  5-HTP 
injected  rats  may  be  a  part  of  5-HTergic  signaling 
mediated  by  5-HT1  receptors,  but  not  by  5-HT2 
receptors,  possibly  blunting  the  orectic  NPYergic 
signal  in  the  PVN. 
    It  is  speculated  that  5-HT-induced  hypophagia  is 
predominantly  mediated  by  central  5-HT  pathways, 
although  the  mechanism  has  not  been  fully  defined. 
Heisler  and  colleagues  (2006)  have  suggested  that 
5-HT-induced  hypophagia  is  mediated  by  down-
stream  activation  of  melanocortin  4  receptor  (Mc4r). 
They  hypothesized  that  5-HT  action  at  the  arcuate 
nucleus  would  lead  to  a  decrease  in  the  release  of 
the  endogenous  melanocortin  receptor  (MCR)  an-
tagonist  AgRP  and  an  increase  in  the  release  of 
the  endogenous  MCR  agonist  α-MSH  at  down-
stream  MCR-expressing 
target  sites.  Mc4rs  are 
expressed  in  the  hypothalamic  PVN  (Kishi  et  al., 
2003),  where  the  axons  of  AgRP  and  α-MSH 
neurons  are  richly  innervated  from  the  arcuated 
nucleus  (Elmquist  et  al.,  1998;  1999).  Previous 

the  PVN 

138 Young  Wha  Moon,  et  al.

study  has  suggested  that  pERK1/2  is  a  downstream 
effecter  of  the  central  Mc4rs  mediating  hypophagia 
(Sutton  et  al.,  2005).  Thus,  one  can  prospect  that 
the  increased  pERK1/2  level  in  the  PVN  of  5-HTP 
injected  rats  may  be  a  consequence  of  Mc4rs 
activation  by  increased  release  of  its  agonist  α- 
MSH  in  the  PVN.  However,  5-HTP  injections  did 
not  increase  the  expression  of  proopiomelanocortin 
(POMC),  functional  precursor  of  α-MSH,  in  the 
arcuate  nucleus  (our  unpublished  observation).  We 
have  previously  reported  that  the  arcuate  POMC 
expression  is  decreased  by  chronic  treatment  with 
selective  5-HT  reuptake  inhibitor  fluoxetine  known  to 
increase  the  brain  5-HT  level  (Myung  et  al.,  2005). 
Thus,  it  is  concluded  that  the  increased  pERK1/2  in 
the  PVN  of  5-HTP  injected  rats  is  less  likely  due  to 
an  activation  of  melanocortin  pathways.
