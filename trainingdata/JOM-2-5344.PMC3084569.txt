Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Lactobacilli reuteri (Prodentis) alone and in
combination with scaling and root planing (SRP) in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
trial of volunteers with chronic periodontitis.
Methods: Thirty, otherwise systemically healthy, chronic periodontitis patients (19 males and 11 females, aged
between 34 and 50 years) were included. The study period was 42 days. ‘Split-mouth’ design was used for the
SRP, which was performed on day 0; two quadrants (either right or left) were treated with SRP whereas the
remaining two quadrants were left untreated. The participants received a toothbrush, toothpaste, and brushing
instructions. L. reuteri Prodentis lozenges (1108 CFU DSM179381108 CFU ATCC PTA 5289) or the
corresponding placebo lozenges were taken twice daily from day 21 to day 42. Statistical analysis was done for
comparisons of clinical parameters (Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI),
probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL)) and microbiological levels of the pathogens
Aggregibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Prevotella intermedia (Pi). All
p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Assessments were made on day 0 before SRP treatment, on
day 21 before administration of the lozenges, and on day 42.
Results: At day 42, the PI, GI, and GBI were significantly reduced by all treatment modalities. When ranked,
the amount of PI, GI and GBI reduction by the different treatments was SRPProdentisProdentisSRP
placeboplacebo; all differences were statistically significant. For PPD and CAL, the best result was obtained
with the SRPProdentis treatment. PPD was reduced from 5.0890.75 to 3.7890.61 mm (pB0.001) and CAL
from 3.9390.93 to 2.8590.74 mm (pB0.001). Prodentis, either alone or following SRP, reduced Aa, Pi, and
Pg by 1 log10 unit (pB0.01). The SRPplacebo combination did not significantly affect the levels of the
pathogens.
Conclusion: The present randomized controlled trial confirms the plaque inhibition, anti-inflammatory, and
antimicrobial effects of L. reuteri Prodentis. L. reuteri Prodentis probiotic can be recommended during non-
surgical therapy and the maintenance phase of periodontal treatment. Considering the beneficial effects of
probiotics, this therapy could serve as a useful adjunct or alternative to periodontal treatment when SRP might
be contraindicated. Further studies are required in this direction.

There is a long tradition, particularly in parts of

Europe and Asia, of ingesting microbes or food
products that affect the intestinal microbiota in
ways that are believed to provide beneficial health effects,
i.e. intake of probiotics and prebiotics. According to the

World Health Organization, probiotics are defined as
viable microorganisms that confer a health benefit when
administered in sufficient doses.

A few studies have revealed that probiotic Lactobacillus
strains were useful in reducing gingival inflammation and

the number of black-pigmented rods, including Porphyr-
omonas gingivalis (Pg),
in the saliva and subgingival
plaque (13). Concerning periodontal conditions, Teughels
and coworkers (4) have shown that application of bene-
ficial bacteria, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing
(SRP), can inhibit recolonization of pathogens in period-
ontal pockets and reduce bleeding on probing in dogs.
Another clinical trial demonstrated a reduced prevalence
of moderate to severe gingival inflammation as well as an
improved Plaque Index (PI) and probing depth in adults
after regular use of probiotic tablets (5). Also, probiotic
chewing gums consumed over the course of 2 weeks caused
a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines in gingivitis
patients (6).

On the other hand, mechanical debridement by SRP
is one of the basic periodontal treatment procedures
known to reduce periodontal inflammatory effects (79).
A Medline search using the key words ‘CGP’ (chronic
generalized periodontitis), ‘SRP,’ and ‘Probiotics’ revealed
a lack of data on Gingival Index (GI) and Gingival
Bleeding Index (GBI) reduction after SRP along with
probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease. To date,
the combination of SRP and probiotics has not been
addressed as a treatment protocol
for periodontal
patients. Hence, to determine the effects of probiotics in
periodontitis cases, we conducted a double blind, rando-
mized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with
chronic periodontitis.

Material and methods
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind,
split-mouth designed clinical study to evaluate the effect
of probiotic lozenges with and without SRP on the
clinical parameters and microbiological profile in sub-
gingival plaque samples of chronic periodontitis patients.
To calculate the proper sample size, the change in
probing depth at the end of 42 days was estimated to be
0.1 mm in the test group. The sample size was calculated
to be approximately 15 subjects each in the test and
placebo groups with a power of 0.80 and a at 0.05.

Patients of both sexes within the age limit of 3550 years
were eligible for inclusion. Patients diagnosed as suffering
from chronic periodontitis as clinically evidenced by
gingivitis together with mild to moderate periodontal
pockets (57 mm) clinically and radiographic evidence of
bone loss were included (10). Apart from having chronic
periodontitis, the patients were in general good health and
had not participated in any clinical trial during the
previous 4 weeks. No patient had ongoing antibiotic
treatment or any systemic disease. Patients who were
pregnant,
lactating, smokers, alcoholic, or who had
undergone any surgical or non-surgical therapy within
6 months prior to the start of the study were not included.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

All subjects were assigned to one of the two groups
(Prodentis group or placebo group) by using a randomi-
zation table. To maintain full blinding of the results, the
randomization code was held by one of the authors
remotely from all assessments and was not broken until
all data had been collected and all analyses had been
performed. The randomization was concealed by using
sequentially numbered, identical-appearing containers of
probiotic or placebo tablets.

Clinical and microbiological parameters were recorded
at baseline (day 0), on day 21, and day 42. The clinical
parameters recorded were PI (11), GI (12), GBI (13),
probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level
(CAL) (14). PPD and CAL were measured for the indexed
teeth of the Community Periodontal Index using the
WHO probe (14). All parameters were assessed by a single
clinical investigator experienced with the index systems.
Patients were given Lactobacillus
reuteri Prodentis
(containing a minimum of 1108 colony forming units
(CFU) for each of the strains DSM17938 and ATCC PTA
5289 (Prodentis)). Both study products, Prodentis and
placebo lozenges, were identical in shape, texture, and
taste. The patients were instructed to suck one lozenge by
sucking in the morning and one at night, after brushing
their teeth (2). The lozenges were administered to the
patients from day 21 after the clinical and microbiological
parameters had been assessed and continued until day 42.
Split-mouth SRP in all patients was achieved by
treating two quadrants with SRP on day 0 while two
quadrants were left untreated. SRP was performed using
ultrasonic (Cavitron†  BOBCAT PRO, DENTSPLY;
Power-240AC 50/60Hz 80VA) and hand instruments
(Universal Gracey Curettes, 2R/2L and 4R/4L Hufriedy).
After SRP,
the patients were instructed to perform
regular oral hygiene habits, i.e. twice daily brushing by
‘roll-on technique’ for a minimum of 2 min, using a
regular toothpaste (STOLIN-R† Dr. Reddy’s Lab) and
regular toothbrushes (Stim† toothbrush  DentAids Pvt.
Ltd.), which were provided to each subject.

After recording the clinical parameters, at least 1012
sites with 57 mm pocket depth were selected for sub-
gingival pooled plaque sample collection separately for
each half of the mouth. The pooled plaque samples were
collected at baseline and on day 21 and day 42 from the
same sites. The sample site was isolated with sterile cotton
rolls and the supragingival plaque was removed using
cotton rolls and air dried. A sterile curette was introduced
to the base of the pocket and plaque was removed. The
curette with the collected plaque was dispensed in
separate vials containing transport media viz. thioglyco-
late broth with hemin and Vit k (transport 8 medium) and
sealed tightly to avoid contamination. Samples were
processed within 2 days of collection. The sample was
mixed thoroughly and 5 ml aliquots were inoculated using
a sterile loop onto petri plates with the following

mediums: enriched trypticase soy agar for Aggregibacter
actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) cultivation (15); kanamycin
blood agar for Pg (16); and kanamycin and vancomycin
blood agar for Prevotella intermedia (Pi)
(16). The
samples were then vortexed at 3000g for 1 min to break
the plaque and to obtain uniform dispersal of organisms.
The plates were kept under anaerobic conditions. The
medium for Aa was incubated in a desiccator with 5%
carbon dioxide at 378C for 5 days. The plates were
incubated for a minimum of 72 h. After the specified
period, the colonies were characterized according to size,
shape, hemolysis, and pigmentation and the number of
each colony type was counted.

Aa was identified by its characteristic star-shaped
colonies on the agar plate, Gram negative coccobacillary
morphology, negative indole test, nitrate reduction, and
glucose fermentation. Porphyromonas and Prevotella
species were provisionally identified by pigment produc-
tion, colony characters, cell morphology, and the variation
in their susceptibility to kanamycin and vancomycin. The
identity of these organisms was further confirmed by
subjecting them to a series of biochemical reactions, which
included indole production, nitrate reduction, and
sugar fermentation tests. The sugars tested were dextrose,
mannitol,
lactose, sucrose, maltose, salicin, glycerol,
xylose, arabinose, trehalose, rhamnose, and xylan. A
uniform standardized suspension of
the organisms
was prepared in thioglycollate broth and inoculated into
peptone yeast extract broth containing 1% of the appro-
priate sugar and bromocresole purple as the indicator. The
tubes were incubated for 48 h in a modified gas-pak
anaerobic jar and the fermentation reactions were noted
by a change in the color of the indicator to yellow.
Indole and nitrate reduction tests were performed by
spot disc method using commercially available reagents
(Hi-Media).

All clinical and microbiologic data collected were
subjected to statistical analysis. Results are expressed as
mean9SD and proportions as percentages. For clinical
parameters,
intra-group comparisons were made by
paired t-test and inter-group comparison by unpaired
t-test. For microbiological parameters, non-parametric
methods were used for analysis since microbes were non-
normally distributed; the Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was
used for intra-group comparison and the MannWhitney
test for inter-group comparison. For all tests a p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The study protocol was in accordance with the local
ethical guidelines and in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration of Human Rights and approved by the local
ethics committee.

Results
Thirty, systemically healthy, chronic periodontitis patients
(19 males and 11 females, aged between 34 and 50 years)

Probiotics in periodontics

were included. Age, gender distribution, clinical and
microbiological parameters were similar in both groups
at day 0 (baseline) (Table 1). All subjects completed the
42-day study period. There were no significant differences
in the clinical and microbiological parameters between the
Prodentis and placebo groups at day 0.

The active study product of Prodentis lozenges was
re-analyzed by the producer (BioGaia AB, Sweden) at the
end of the study and the CFU count of both strains was
above the stipulated shelf-life limit of 1108 CFU. The
presence of lactobacilli in the saliva, plaque, or gingival
pockets was not assessed in this study.

Within both the Prodentis and the placebo groups, with
or without SRP, PI, GI, or GBI, the reduction was highly
significant (pB0.001) over the treatment periods (Fig. 1).
The maximum reduction of PI (0.7690.29) was obtained
for the combination of SRP and Prodentis, which was
statistically significant when compared to all other
treatment modalities (pB0.01) (Table 2). In the untreated
quadrants, Prodentis was significantly better than the
placebo with a reduction of 0.4190.16 and 0.1790.14,
respectively (pB0.001). Also for the GI and GBI, the best
reduction was obtained with the combination of SRP and
Prodentis as compared with the other treatment mod-
alities (pB0.001), the GI fell from 1.8590.22 to 1.019
0.10 and the GBI from 81.6918.4 to 11.194.6% over the
full period. In the untreated quadrants, Prodentis was
better than the placebo on both accounts, the GI was
reduced by 0.5390.12 and 0.1490.14 units (pB0.001)
and the GBI by 48.3914.4 and 12.098.7 percentage
units (pB0.001), respectively. An interesting observation
was that Prodentis alone demonstrated a highly signifi-
cant (pB0.001) GBI reduction as compared to SRP alone.
In the untreated quadrants, the PPD was only slightly

significantly reduced PPD from 5.2690.53 to 4.779
0.60 mm (pB0.001). The maximum PPD reduction was
observed in SRPProdentis treatment from 5.0890.75
to 3.7890.61 mm, which was significantly better than
SRP alone (pB0.001).

The CAL did not change significantly over time in the
untreated quadrants group receiving placebo whereas
there was a small decrease in the corresponding Prodentis
group from 3.8591.44 to 3.6791.31 mm (pB0.05),
which was also better than for the placebo group (pB
0.05). The SRPplacebo treatment yielded a decrease
from 4.4691.94 to 4.1791.82 mm (pB0.05). Again, the
best result was obtained for the combination of SRP
Prodentis where the CAL dropped from 3.9390.93 to
2.8590.74 mm (pB0.001). This was also better than any
other treatment modality (pB0.001).

The only treatment modalities that were able to
significantly reduce the CFU counts of the pathogens
Aa, Pg, and Pi were those including Prodentis, either
alone or in combination with SRP (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
All three pathogens were equally sensitive toward Pro-

dentis treatment and bacterial counts were reduced by
approximately 1 log10 unit from 106 CFU/ml to less than
105 CFU/ml.

Compliance to the study treatment was appreciable
and no subject rejected using the lozenges. Hypersensi-
tivity as a symptom of root caries was not reported by
any of the study subjects and no other adverse reactions
were reported by the subjects or observed by the clinician
during the study period.

Discussion
The effect of SRP as a non-surgical mode of periodontal
therapy is well discussed in the literature in terms of a
reduction of clinical and microbial parameters. Accord-
ing to a review in 2009 (17), the basic/initial treatment for
periodontal patients in terms of SRP has not been
compared with the probiotic effect in the reduction of
clinical and microbiological parameters. Hence, an initial
attempt has been made in this randomized, double blind
clinical trial to evaluate and compare the benefits of the

probiotic Prodentis alone and SRPProdentis in the
treatment of chronic periodontitis.

In both the Prodentis and the placebo groups, PI, GI,
and GBI were significantly reduced within each treatment
group over the 42 days and thus even the placebo, with or
without SRP, had a significant effect. However, such
placebo effects are known to occur as a simple conse-
quence of the contact between clinicians and patients (18,
19) and that they were instructed on proper brushing
technique when the study started.

The effect of SRP on plaque reduction is similar to that
reported by Mousque`s et al. (9) and Proye et al. (20).
Mousque`s reported the reduction of PI and GI during
the first 14 days after a single mouth SRP and Proye et al.
reported the response of 128 periodontal pockets
(37 mm) in 10 subjects after a single episode of SRP
to give a significant reduction in PI and gingival findings
after 1 week.

In the Prodentis group, the combination of SRP
Prodentis demonstrated a significant reduction of PI
when compared to SRP and probiotic effects individually,
thus the plaque reduction brought about by SRP was
enhanced by the use of probiotics. Probiotics and SRP
alone were similarly efficacious in plaque reduction. i.e.
no difference in mean plaque reduction was observed.
Krasse et al. (2) conducted a study to assess if the
probiotic L. reuteri could be effective in the treatment of
gingivitis and further to evaluate the influence of the
probiotic on plaque and the lactobacilli population in the
saliva. In their study, L. reuteri was efficacious in
reducing both gingivitis and plaque in patients with
moderate to severe gingivitis.

In the Prodentis group, both the GI score and GBI
percentage reduction were significant both with Prodentis
alone and in combination with SRP. An interesting
observation was that the Prodentis alone group demon-
strated a highly significant gingival bleeding reduction as
compared to SRP alone. Interestingly, the gingival bleed-
ing reduction by SRP was enhanced by the probiotic. Ma
et al. (21) studied the in-vitro effects of live L. reuteri on
human epithelial cells and found that L. reuteri
is
able to block the TNFa-induced secretion of the pro-
inflammatory IL-8, upregulate NGF, and inhibit NF-kB
translocation to the nucleus. Twetman et al. (6) investi-
gated the clinical effect of a chewing gum containing
probiotic bacteria on gingival inflammation and the levels
of selected inflammatory mediators in gingival crevicular
fluid (GCF) in patients with gingivitis. The chewing gums
contained two strains of L. reuteri: ATCC 55730 and
ATCC PTA 5289 (1108 CFU/gum, respectively). They
found that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, TNFa,
and IL-8 in GCF were reduced by active probiotic
treatment, which gives clinical support to the findings by
Ma et al. (21). This may be the proof of a principle for a
probiotic approach to combating inflammation in the oral
cavity and the findings by Twetman et al. (6) are confirmed
in the present study as evidenced by the reduced gingivitis
parameters (GI and GBI).

There was a significant improvement of PPD and CAL
in the Prodentis group, which could possibly be due to the
significant reduction in the GI and PI. The maximum
PPD reduction was observed in those receiving SRP
Prodentis treatment and this reduction (1.31 mm) was
more than twice the sum of the SRP alone reduction
added to the Prodentis alone reduction (0.490.10 mm),

suggesting a synergistic effect. An improvement was
observed for CAL; SRP alone yielded 0.29 mm, Prodentis
yielded 0.17 mm and the combination resulted in a CAL
improvement of 1.09 mm. It should be noted that to our
knowledge this is the first time that Prodentis or any other
probiotic treatment has been shown to improve CAL. In a
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study,
Shimauchi et al. (5) reported a significant improvement
of the PI and PPD in the probiotic group (L. salivarius
WB21), but CAL was not assessed in their study. More-
over,
in their clinical setting there was no significant
difference between the probiotic and placebo group in the
complete set of patients.

It has been observed that there is a substantial in vitro
variation in the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus

spp. when examined together with several oral micro-
organisms, including the periodontal pathogens Aa and
Pg (9). Aa strains were the most susceptible species to
lactobacilli under the conditions of this experiment. The
in-vitro effect of probiotics on Aa, Pg, and Pi has been
studied (22), and in the present study the antimicrobial
effect of L. reuteri Prodentis has been tried for the first
time in clinical periodontitis cases. The effect of L. reuteri
Prodentis on salivary mutans streptococci was not
addressed in the present study, but as reported by Caglar
et al. (31), L. reuteri significantly reduces mutans strepto-
cocci when administered over a 10-day period.

In the present study, the mean CFU reduction of the
three assessed pathogens was highest for the combination
of SRPProdentis followed by Prodentis alone and

the size of the reduction was approximately one log unit.
The mechanisms of inhibition of periodontal pathogens
have not been fully clarified. The inhibitory activity
displayed by homofermentative
lactobacilli against
periodontal pathogens was principally related to their
production of acid, not to H2O2 or bacteriocin production
(23). In the present study, at baseline the 30 chronic
generalized periodontitis patients demonstrated the pre-
sence of Aa, Pg, and Pi, in accordance with the findings of
Socransky et al. (23). The results obtained by Mousque´s
et al. (9) suggest that a single session of SRP is capable of
disturbing the proportions of certain bacterial forms in
the subgingival periodontal flora, and that it may require
approximately 42 days for the proportions to return to
baseline levels. Studies designed to determine the effect of
SRP on the subgingival microbial flora have consistently
reported significant reductions in the percentage of motile
microbes and spirochetes (9, 22, 23), Pg and other Gram
negative anaerobic bacteria and a concomitant increase
in the percentage of cocci and non-motile bacteria (9,
24, 25).

In contrast to the obtained effects of SRP alone on the
clinical parameters, we found no significant effects of SRP
alone on the microbiological parameters. However, this
phenomenon has also been reported by others. Sbordone
et al. (26) evaluated the recolonization patterns of the
subgingival microflora of
eight adult periodontitis
patients after a single session of SRP. Their results
indicate that a single session of SRP is clearly insufficient
to maintain a healthy subgingival microflora. Mombelli et
al. (27) conducted a study to determine the topographic
distribution of Aa in patients with adult periodontitis
before and after mechanical periodontal
treatment
(repeated oral hygiene instructions and systematic deep
SRP) and found that Aa was present in 40% of the samples
taken before and in 23% of the samples taken after
treatment. Persistence of the organism after thorough
debridement of root surfaces has also been reported (27).
strains used in the present
study produce the antimicrobial substance reuterin,
3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, within biofilms (28, 29) and
it was recently demonstrated that reuterin induces oxida-
tive stress in pathogenic organisms (29), which accounts for
its anti-pathogenic effect. Reuterin is effective against a
vast array of intestinal pathogens (30, 31) and the present
study suggests a similar effect against selected periodontal
pathogens. To our knowledge, the present study is the first
of its kind to demonstrate the in vivo antimicrobial effect of
L. reuteri Prodentis in a clinical setting.

Both the L.

reuteri

The present randomized controlled trial confirms the
plaque inhibition, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial
effects of L. reuteri Prodentis. Hence, the L. reuteri
Prodentis probiotic is suggested as an addition to
mechanical debridement and during the maintenance
phase of periodontal treatment. Further randomized

controlled clinical trials over longer periods are required
to build up stronger evidence for probiotic application of
L. reuteri Prodentis supporting a periodontal treatment
protocol.
