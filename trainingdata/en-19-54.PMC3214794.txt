ABSTRACT

We  provide  a  novel  method  to  infer  finger  flexing  motions  using  a  four‐channel 
surface  electromyogram  (EMG).  Surface  EMG  signals  can  be  recorded  from  the 
human  body  non‐invasively  and  easily.  Surface  EMG  signals  in  this  study  were 
obtained  from  four  channel  electrodes  placed  around  the  forearm.  The  motions  consist 
of  the  flexion  of  five  single  fingers  (thumb,  index  finger,  middle  finger,  ring  finger,  and 
little  finger)  and  three  multi‐finger  motions.  The  maximum  likelihood  estimation  was 
used  to  infer  the  finger  motions.  Experimental  results  have  shown  that  this  method  can 
successfully  infer  the  finger  flexing  motions.  The  average  accuracy  was  as  high  as 
97.75%.  In  addition,  we  examined  the  influence  of  inference  accuracies  with  the 
various  arm  postures.

INTRODUCTION

    Compared  to  the  invasive  type  electromyogram 
(EMG)  for  measuring  each  motor  unit  action  po-
tential  (MUAP)  on  muscle  fiber  in  a  small  area, 
surface  EMG  signals  can  be  recorded  from  the 

human  body  non‐invasively  and  easily  over  wide 

the  motion 

skin  areas.  To  extract 
information, 
surface  EMG  signal  processing  has  been  studied, 
especially  focusing  on  controlling  electronic  devices 
such  as  a  human  supporting  prosthetic  arms  and 
smart  interface  (Sornmo  and  Laguna,  2005).  Since 
motor  commands  are  transmitted  through  internal 
nerve  tissues  or  muscles,  inferring  such  commands 
only  from  the  surface  EMG  signals  is  not  an  easy

task. 
    Thus  many  attempts  to  extract  motor  information 
from  surface  EMG  have  been  made.  A  study  of 
Englehart  et  al.  (2001)  used  wavelet  analysis  and 
PCA  analysis  to  classify  two  arm  motions  and  two 
wrist  motions.  Also,  Englehart  and  Hudgins  (2003) 
used  the  absolute  mean  value,  the  zero  crossing 
rate,  and  the  wavelength  to  classify  four  arm  and 
wrist  motions.  Momen  et  al.  (2007)  used  RMS  and 
FCMs  to  classify  arm  and  wrist  motions.  Hudgins  et 
al.  (1993)  obtained  an  ensemble  average  of  EMG 
signals,  and  used  a  neural  networks  (NN) 
to 
classify  four  arm  motions. 

    While  the  surface  EMG‐based  motion  inference 

has  been  focused  on  upper  limb  or  hand  motions, 
studies  on  inferring  dexterous  finger  motions  have 
not  been  done  so  much.  Nishikawa  et  al.  (1999) 
used  the  Gabor  transform  and  absolute  mean  value

based  on  NN.  Nagata  et  al.  (2007)  used  absolute 
sum  analysis,  canonical  component  analysis,  and 
minimum  Euclidean  distance  to  classify  four  wrist 
motions  and 
finger  motions.  Uchida  et  al. 
(1992)  used  FFT  analysis  and  NN  to  classify  four 
finger  motions.  Chen  et  al.  (2007)  used  mean 
absolute  values  (MAV),  the  ratio  of  the  MAVs, 
autoregressive  (AR)  model,  and  linear  Bayesian 
classifier  to  classify  5∼16  finger  motions.  However, 
NN  classifiers  (Hudgins  et  al.,  1993;  Chen  et  al., 
2007;  Nagata  et  al.,  2007)  have  strong  dependency 
on  initial  parameter  conditions.  Also,  linear  classi-
fiers  (Uchida  et  al.,  1992;  Englehart  et  al.,  2001; 
Englehart  and  Hudgins,  2003;  Momen  et  al.,  2007; 
Nagata  et  al.,  2007)  are  simple  but  show  low 
accuracy  compared  with  nonlinear  classifiers. 
    In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  novel  method  to  infer 
the  finger  motions  using  surface  EMG  signals.  We 
recorded  the  EMG  signals  during  finger  flexing 
motions.  To  infer  the  finger  motions,  we  used  the 
maximum  likelihood  method.  The  likelihood  was 
obtained  by  building  probabilistic  models  of  EMG 
activities.  The  information  entropy  of  the  EMG  mag-
nitude  was  calculated  to  quantify  the  EMG  acti-
vities.  Experimentally  we  demonstrated 
the 
proposed  method  could  infer  the  finger  flexing  mo-

tions  including  multi‐fingers  as  high  as  97.75%.

Multi‐channel  EMG  recording
    A  signal  acquisition  device  (Poly‐G‐A,  Laxtha  Inc., 
Korea),  bi‐polar  Ag‐AgCl  electrodes  (Dual  electrode 
(SECS‐4,  Laxtha  Inc.,  Korea)  were  used.  The  EMG

512  Hz  and  was  filtered  to  reduce  power  line  noise.

this  study  and  was  trained  before  signal  recording. 
The  subjects  were  instructed  to  maintain  their  own 
flexing  speed  and  strength. 
    The  EMG  signal  was  acquired  with  four  channels 
on  the  left  forearm  (around  the  wrist)  for  3.0  se-
conds.  Fig.  1  shows  electrode  orientation  for  EMG 
recording.  During  the  first  1.5  seconds,  the  subject 

did  not  perform  any  motion  ‐  termed  ‘relaxation’  ‐ 

and  waited  for  an  acoustic  alarm.  After  1.5  se-
conds,  the  subject  heard  the  acoustic  alarm  and 
then  flexed  a  finger  immediately.  After  3.0  seconds, 
the  EMG  signal  recording  procedure  ended.  In  the 
experiment,  the  subject  performed  eight  finger  flex-

ing  motions  including  three  multi‐finger  motions.  Fig. 

2  shows  the  detail  of  the  finger  motions.  The 
subject  took  a  long  and  sufficient  rest  between 
recording  procedures  to  avoid  muscle  fatigue  or 
cramp.

Statistical  EMG  modeling 

    The  amplitude  of  the  EMG  signal  is  a  funda-
mental  quantity  which  increases  monotonically  with 
the  force  developed  in  the  muscle  (Sornmo  and 
Laguna,  2005).  Moreover,  the  EMG  signal  repre-
sents  a  stochastic  signal  (Sornmo  and  Laguna, 
2005).
    The  entropy  (information  entropy,  H)  was  used  to 
represent  the  characteristics  of  each  EMG  signal 
activity  during  finger  flexing  motions.  The  entropy  is 
a  measure  that  can  reveal  how  much  dynamical 
nature  and  the  information  (Shannon  and  Weaver, 
1963)  which  the  signal  contains.  Some  EEG  an-
alysis  methods  based  on  entropy  have  been  de-
veloped.  (Capurro  et  al.,  1999;  Martin  et  al.,  2000; 
Tong  et  al.,  2002;  Shin  et  al.  2006;  Sabeti  et  al., 
2009)  Although  the  amplitude  range  or  the  spectral 
bandwidth  of  EMG  and  EEG  signal  are  remarkably 
different,  but  they  have  a  non-  stationary  stochastic 
property  in  common.

    We  set  nine  arm  postures  to  find  out  how  much 
accuracies  hold  down  when  human  changes  arm

    Matrices  on  the  diagonal  site  in  Fig.  9  show 
inference  accuracies  for  five  single-finger  flexion 
motions  of  each  posture;  the  number  of  training 
data  was  25  and  that  of  test  data  was  equal.  Each

are  shown  in  Table  4.  The  shaded  cells  indicate  the 
maximum  average  accuracy  in  the  same  row  and 
these  match  the  diagonal  cells.
    Accordingly,  the  data  of  an  posture  is  not  ap-
propriate  to  the  reference  of  other  postures.  This 
fact  indicates  that  a  robust  finger  motion  decoding 
method  cannot  be  implemented  without  a  scheme 
detects  changes  of  arm's  posture.

DISCUSSION

    We  have  proposed  a  new  method  to  infer  finger 
flexing  motions  based  on  the  entropy  and  the 

maximum  likelihood  estimation.  The  average  recog-
nition  accuracy  for  six  finger  motions  was  100.00% 
and  the  accuracy  for  eight  finger  motions  was 
97.75%.  Also  we  have  shown 
the  quantitative 
interpretation  of  the  need  of  avoidance  of  use  of 
reference  dataset  cross  arm  posture  because  that 
influences  the  correlations  between  the  EMG  sig-
nals  and  the  performed  finger  flexing  motions.  This 

study  may  trigger  a  new  type  of  human‐computer 

interface  with  user’s  intuitive  hand  motions  which 
could  control  electronic  devices.
