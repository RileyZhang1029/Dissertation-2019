In order to understand the sequence-structure relationship of proteins, sev- eral sub-sequence search studies in non-redundant sequence-structure databases have been under- taken which have given some fruitful clues.
In our earlier work, we analyzed a set of 3124 non- redundant protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and retrieved 30 identical octapep- tides having different secondary structures.
These octapeptides were characterized by using different computational procedures.
This prompted us to explore the presence of octapeptides with reverse sequences and to analyze whether these octapeptides would adopt similar structures as that of their parent octapeptides.
Our identical reverse octapeptide search resulted in the ﬁnding of eight octapep- tide pairs (octapeptide and reverse octapeptide) with similar secondary structure and 23 octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures.
In the present work, the geometrical and biophysical char- acteristics of identical reverse octapeptides were explored and compared with unrelated octapeptide pairs by using various computational tools.
We thus conclude that proteins containing identical reverse octapeptides are not very abundant and residues in the octapeptide pairs do not contribute to the stability of the protein.
Furthermore, compared to unrelated octapeptides, identical reverse octapeptides do not show certain biophysical and geometrical properties.

However this is not the case and many unsolved problems re- main.
Various attempts have been made to study the stability and folding of proteins and peptides by using reduced repre- sentation of proteins as well as by reading the protein se- quences backward.
Several theoretical and experimental approaches toward studying retro proteins have been carried out and give contradictory results [1].
Skolnick and coworkers made a systematic study by gener- ating retro proteins and found a very low number of similar 3D structures between inversely similar proteins and they also reported that short helices keep their conformations even when the sequence is inverted [2].

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2012.11.005   Saravanan KM and Selvaraj S / Search for Identical Reverse Octapeptides in Unrelated Proteins  115  sequence databases revealed that a protein with identical com- position but with backward read primary structure should fold under native conditions in to a similar structure compared with the original sequence [3].
Since the retro protein has the same amino acid composition and hydrophobicity proﬁles as the native protein, all structure prediction methods based on amino acid composition may fail.
The assumption that the retro protein would adopt the mirror image of the native protein is very unlikely, because right- handed helices would have to be replaced by left-handed heli- ces.
Changes in the secondary structure of the retro protein are signiﬁcant because the packing of the native topology is similar to the packing of the original protein [4].
Nebel et al proposed that the abundance of retro proteins primarily can be explained by the fact that they display the same repeat struc- tures and amino acid propensity of existing proteins [5].
In contrast to proteins, studies of smaller peptide fragments with inverted sequences have provided fruitful clues toward understanding protein sequence-structure relationships.
Several studies on reversed proteins and peptides consisting of D-amino acids which form the mirror image structures of the respective L- amino acid protein have been carried out [6 8] and validated experimentally by synthesizing D-human immuno deﬁciency virus protease which showed reciprocal chirality [9].
There are several other interesting studies of retro peptides.
One such example is a hairpin peptide mimic of the FcRI chain that inhibits IgE-FcRI interactions both in its native and retro form, which has potential for the treatment of allergic disor- ders [10].
Rai has used the S peptide from ribonuclease S as a model system and explored the relationship between native and reverse conformations of the peptide by using circular dichroism (CD) [7].
Huang and coworkers synthesized a novel peptide by reversing the sequence of the human metallothionein-2a do- main to analyze its chemical and spectroscopic properties.
The results of their analysis indicate that the reversion of the amino acid sequence for a domain does not change its foldabil- ity and metal-binding capacity, suggesting that the order of its sequence is not essential for the formation of a critical metal- tetrathiolate nucleus [11].
In our previous work, we performed a systematic analysis of the role of long-range contacts in homologous families of proteins in determining the ﬁnal native structure [12].
Our analysis indicated the importance of co- operative long-range interactions in determining the ﬁnal con- formations of two proteins with 88% sequence identity but adopting different folds and functions [13].
The importance of cooperative long-range interactions for protein stability was further veriﬁed experimentally by studying the fragments of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 in barley [14].
In our previous pa- per, we have characterized 30 identical octapeptides adopting different conformations by computing difference in the num- ber of long-range contacts of residues [15].
In the present work, we performed a systematic search of identical reverse octapeptides in the sequences of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [16] to explore the structural and functional features of the protein fragments in reversed form.
The results from our analysis imply that protein fragments of eight residues of a given protein and their reversed form in another unrelated protein are not very abundant.
The geometric and biophysical properties, such as volume, surface area, dipole and quadrapole moments and continuous symmetry measure in such octapep- tides, were examined in detail.
Also the gene ontology (GO)  terms of the proteins containing reverse octapeptides are ex- tracted to understand the structure-function relationship.
Results  Reverse octapeptide search  While searching for the reverse form of the overlapping octapep- tide segments in each of the proteins of the 3124 PDB sequences, we found 8 octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and reverse octapep- tide) with similar secondary structure (Table S1) and 23 octa- peptide pairs with different secondary structures (Table 1).
The occurrence of proteins containing identical reverse octapep- tides with similar and different secondary structures is very low, which was 0.5% and 1.4%, respectively, while 98% of proteins do not contain identical reverse octapeptides.
These data dem- onstrated the low abundance of such inverse fragments in a large number of unrelated protein sequences.
However, it is not sur- prising that an octapeptide and its reverse sequence adopt simi- lar secondary structures, due to the similar amino acid composition and certain similar biophysical properties such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, etc.
Interestingly, we have found eight octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure, which are mainly made up of helices.
The occurrence of each of the 20 amino acid residues in re- verse octapeptides having similar and different conformations is shown in Figure 1.
Leucine (L) and glutamic acid (E), which are generally considered as helix favoring residues, appear with high percentage, whereas in peptides adopting different sec- ondary structures, their occurrence was relatively low ( 10% and 9%, respectively).
Since glutamic acid and its salts perform important functions such as neurotransmitting and ﬂavor enhancing, understanding the role of glutamic acid in octapep- tides may provide fruitful insights in peptide and biomaterials design [17].
The low occurrence of tryptophan (W) may be ex- plained by the fact that the L-stereoisomer of tryptophan is present in proteins, but the D-stereoisomer is only occasionally found in naturally-produced peptides [18].
The amino acid residues in the octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure are mainly occupied by hydrophilic resi- dues and they are generally surrounded by very minimum con- tacting residues [19 20].
Since hydrophobic residues tend to be buried in the core of proteins, the low occurrence of hydropho- bic residues in octapeptide pairs with similar secondary struc- ture suggests that octapeptide fragments would be found on the protein surface and contribute to various interactions with other molecules.
On the other hand, majority of the residues in octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures are nei- ther hydrophilic (D, E, R, K and H) nor hydrophobic residues (F, I, L, M, V, W, A and P).
Instead, these octapeptide pairs are mainly made up of residues such as G, S, T, C, N, Q and Y.
Volume and surface area of octapeptide pairs  The functional speciﬁcity of a peptide arises from its unique physico chemical properties such as volume and surface area, which are important geometrical quantities associated with macromolecular structures and motions.
Hence, we performed a systematic analysis of surface area and volume of octapeptide pairs with similar conformations (Table S1) and those with different conformations (Table 1).

Consequently, the correlation coefﬁcient between surface areas of the identical reverse octapeptide pairs with sim- ilar secondary structure and that of the octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures is 0.95 and 0.73, respectively.
However, the correlation coefﬁcient between volume and sur- face area of unrelated octapeptide pairs with similar and differ- ent secondary structures seems to be very poor ( 0.04 and  0.03) (Table S2).
The difference in surface areas of unrelated octapeptide pairs implies that the octapeptide and its reverse octapeptide show similar geometric properties such as volume and surface area.
Hence, from our results, we suggest that the octapeptides and their reverse have similar spatial arrange- ments like related octapeptide pairs whereas unrelated octapep- tide pairs do not adopt similar volume and surface area.
The Ca average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of identical re- verse octapeptides is 2.27, which is 3.01 for unrelated octapep- tide pairs.
This implies that the Ca atoms of the unrelated octapeptides and identical reverse octapeptides may not be accurately superimposed on their pair, probably due to the inﬂuence of several other factors such as conformation angle preferences, surrounding residues, position of the octapeptide in the sequence, etc.
Continuous symmetry of octapeptide pairs  Chirality and symmetry are treated as key descriptors of mol- ecules.
Continuous symmetry is a quantitative measure used to track the changes in molecules with similar composition during dynamic processes.
The values of continuous symmetry mea- sure (CSM) seem high for most of the octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures (Table 1) or with similar second- ary structure (Table S1), which implies that the symmetry of the molecule is distorted.
The difference between CSM of an octapeptide and its reverse varies between the different octa- peptide pairs.
Since molecular symmetry can explain many chemical properties, the higher values of CSM in both cases (octapeptide pairs with similar or different secondary struc- tures) imply that the interpretation of physical and chemical properties with respect to their conformations of octapeptide pairs is problematic.
Dipole and quadraploe moment of octapeptide pairs  The net charge and dipole moment of a protein may affect its binding properties and function [21] and hence we have com- puted net charge and dipole moment of the octapeptide and their reverse and correlated between them.
From our analysis,  Figure 2 Difference in dipole moment of identical reverse octapeptides with different conformations   118  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 114 121  no obvious correlation was observed between net charges and dipole moments.
The correlation coefﬁcients between the di- pole moment of octapeptides and their reverse were  0.75 and  0.52 for those with similar secondary structure and with different secondary structures, respectively.
The difference in dipole moments of the identical reverse octapeptides with dif- ferent conformations is shown in Figure 2.
The results reveal the importance of dipole moment in adopting different confor- mations of octapeptide pairs, even though they possess similar residue composition, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and vol- ume.
A similar trend is observed for the quadrapole moment of the octapeptides and their reverse.
These analyses suggested that the dipole and quadrapole moment may play a vital role in protein fragments involved in various binding processes.
Role of stabilizing residues in reverse octapeptides  It is important to know how proteins are stabilized by various residues and their interactions.
In order to understand the role of stabilizing residues in identical reverse octapeptides, we have predicted the stabilizing residues by using the SRide ser- ver [22].
The results reveal that residues present in octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure did not contribute to the stability of a protein.
For octapeptide pairs with different sec- ondary structures, four octapeptide pairs contained stabilizing residues and contributed to the stability of the protein (Ta- ble 1).
Our results suggest that the octapeptide pairs with sim- ilar secondary structure may not contribute to stability whereas the identical reverse octapeptides with different sec- ondary structures may have biological signiﬁcance to the sta- bility of the protein.
Understanding the mechanism by which protein stability is achieved is a challenging task and may help in protein design experiments [23].
GO terms of protein pairs  The description of proteins containing identical reverse octa- peptides with similar and different secondary structures and their corresponding GO terms are given in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.
Most of the proteins containing reverse octapep- tides are enzymes.
Interestingly, 12 hydrolase classes of enzymes contain identical reverse octapeptides.
Reverse  isomerases octapeptides are also observed in transferases, and toxins.
From the GO terms extracted, in the case of octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure, 37.5% of the proteins are involved in binding (DNA binding, metal ion binding, GTP and ATP binding).
18.75% of the proteins are hypothetical (Figure 3).
One synthetic designed protein called GCN4 leucine zipper protein is observed, whose bio- physical properties have been extensively studied [24].
In the case of octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures, the GO terms extracted contain 60.86% of proteins with the term binding, which include zinc ion binding, manga- nese binding, DNA/RNA binding, cation binding, metal ion binding, carbohydrate binding, cellulose binding, magnesium ion binding, protein binding, ATP binding and copper ion binding.
6.52% of the proteins have transferase phosphate containing groups.
Also, they have two hypothetical and one synthetic protein (Figure 3).
Among 46 proteins, 11 belong to the family of hydrolases and 6 belong to the family of trans- ferases.
These suggest that reverse octapeptides are mostly found in enzymes particularly in the hydrolase family.
Discussion  In recent years, several methods based on similarity and dis- similarity comparison have advanced rapidly to understand the structure, function and property of proteins [25 28] paving the way to the design of novel proteins.
For example, Alexan- der et al [29] designed two proteins with identical sequence apart from one residue mismatch and found that these two proteins adopt completely different folds and functions.
De- spite the progress, it still remains whether information gained from such studies is strong enough to predict the structure with 100% accuracy.
Therefore, we believe that the inverse se- quence similarity comparisons of protein or peptide sequences are also important to gain valuable insights into protein se- quence-structure relationship.
Since an identical match of up to eight amino acids may not imply structural similarity [30], we performed an identical re- verse octapeptide search to know whether inverse octapeptide sequences were present in unrelated proteins.
Although these kinds of data analyses on oligopeptides have been actively pur- sued previously [31,32], no previous reports were found in the  Figure 3 Distribution of GO terms of protein containing identical reverse octapeptides with similar and different secondary structures   Saravanan KM and Selvaraj S / Search for Identical Reverse Octapeptides in Unrelated Proteins  119  literature regarding reverse peptide sequence search.
This is the ﬁrst analysis on polypeptides.
Our analysis examined recently- increased datasets of experimentally-determined high resolu- tion PDB sequences and structures (3124 unrelated proteins) and reveals the following observations.
We ﬁnd very low occurrences of octapeptides and their reverse in many PDB se- quences.
Due to the directionality of a protein molecule along the sequence, a protein with the reversed sequence is not some- thing with opposite nature.
Thus, it is not surprising that the pairs of certain octapeptides and their reverse octapeptides sometimes have similar secondary structure.
The amino acid composition of octapeptides and their re- verse octapeptides reveals a relatively high proportion of L and E and null occurrence of W and Y.
Also, the high propor- tion of hydrophilic residues in octapeptide pairs implies that these residues may form few contacts and contribute to bind- ing processes rather than contributing to the stability of the protein.
Therefore, our analysis indicates that the low abun- dance of identical reverse octapeptides in unrelated proteins is due to amino acid composition.
From the volume and surface area computations, the identi- cal reverse octapeptide pairs have similar volume and surface area whereas unrelated octapeptide pairs do not.
Also, the high- er continuous symmetry measure of identical reverse octapep- tides indicates a high distortion of the symmetry of molecules.
From the analysis of GO terms, we found that the proteins con- taining octapeptide pairs are mostly enzymes and involved mainly in binding and transport processes.
The physical proper- ties such as dipole moment and charge are important factors, which can be related to the protein folding laws and its function.
Differences in surfaces of protein fragments and differences in dipole and quadrapole moments are the major reasons for the octapeptide pairs adopting different structures and functions.
Although, a systematic search for the reverse form of the overlapping octapeptide segments is an interesting topic, only 8 octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and reverse octapeptide) with similar secondary structures and 23 octapeptide pairs with dif- ferent secondary structures were identiﬁed in 3124 PDB se- quences.
Although the number of octapeptide pairs seems too low to provide insight into the sequence-structure relation- ship of proteins, the current study indicates that the proteins containing identical reverse octapeptides are not very abun- dant and they do not display speciﬁc biophysical and geomet- ric properties as compared to unrelated octapeptides.
different secondary structures.
The percentage of occurrences of amino acid residues in each of the groups was also computed.
Additionally, in order to know whether reverse octapeptides having different secondary structures display speciﬁc properties compared to unrelated octapeptides, we created a control group of unrelated octapeptides by randomly shufﬂing 23 pairs of identical reverse octapeptides with different conformations for a comparative study.
Computation of percentage of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues  The percentage of hydrophobic (F, I, L, M, V, W, A and P), hydrophilic (D, E, R, K and H) and other residues (G, S, T, C, N, Q and Y) was computed for the octapeptide pairs adopting similar and different secondary structures.
We have also com- puted net charge and attributes (acidic, basic and neutral) of octa- peptide pairs.
To perform the aforementioned computations, we used a peptide property calculator web server, which is freely available at https://www.genscript.com/ssl-bin/site2/peptide_cal- culation.cgi.
The structures of identical reverse octapeptide pairs and unrelated octapeptides were superimposed on each other to obtain the RMSD value using the superimpose server [33].
Computation of volume and surface area of identical reverse octapeptides  To ﬁnd the difference in physical properties of octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and its reverse), we computed volume and surface area using the structure analysis web servers of the He- lix Systems at Scientiﬁc Super Computing at the National Institute of Health accessible at http://helixweb.nih.gov/struct- bio/basic.html.
Computation of continuous symmetry measure  To understand how a change of symmetry affects the chemical and physical properties of a protein fragment, we computed the CSM by using a web server accessible at http://www.csm.

The measure is based on the distance between the investigated molecule and the nearest structure that has the desired symmetry.
The value of this mea- sure ranges from 0 to 100 and higher CSM values indicate the change in the physical shape of octapeptide fragments [34].
Materials and methods  Computation of dipole and quadrapole moment  Dataset  In our previous work [15], we compiled 3124 non-redundant protein sequences and their corresponding three state second- ary structure assignments from PDB [16] to perform various computational studies.
The protein sequences in the dataset were reversed by using a string reverse algorithm with an in house PERL program.
Overlapping octapeptide segments of each of the reversed protein sequences were searched against 3124 non-redundant PDB sequences.
The search process results in a reversed form of the octapeptide which occurs in unrelated proteins.
The octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and its reverse octapeptide) thus obtained were grouped as octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structures and octapeptide pairs with  Dipole and quadrapole moments of molecules might play a signiﬁcant role in affecting the properties and activities of pro- teins.
Hence, we have computed dipole and quadrapole mo- ments of octapeptide fragment pairs by a web server located at the Weizmann institute, Israel [21].
Prediction of stabilizing residues in identical reverse octapeptides  In order to identify whether the residues in an octapeptide and its reverse octapeptide play a vital role in stabilizing the protein molecule, we predicted the stabilizing residues using the SRide server [22].
This server predicts stabilizing residues using sev- eral structure-based parameters such as surrounding hydro- phobicity [35], long-range order [36], conservation score, etc.
120  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 114 121  Extraction of GO terms  In order to ﬁnd what type of proteins or enzymes possesses identical reverse octapeptide, GO terms of the proteins con- taining octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and its reverse) were ex- tracted from PDB annotations and stored in appropriate format.
The extraction process was performed in a com- pletely-automatic manner using in house java scripts on SUN ULTRA 40M2 workstation.
