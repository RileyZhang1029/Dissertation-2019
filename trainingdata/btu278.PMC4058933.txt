One of the reasons is that cancers are complex diseases, regulated by multiple signaling pathways and cross talks among the pathways.
It is expected that drug combinations can reduce drug resistance and improve patients  outcomes.
In clinical practice, the ideal and feasible drug combin- ations are combinations of existing Food and Drug Administration- approved drugs or bioactive compounds that are already used on patients or have entered clinical trials and passed safety tests.
These drug combinations could directly be used on patients with less concern of toxic effects.
However, there is so far no effective computational approach to search effective drug combinations from the enormous number of possibilities.
Results: In this study, we propose a novel systematic computational tool DrugComboRanker to prioritize synergistic drug combinations and uncover their mechanisms of action.
We first build a drug func- tional network based on their genomic profiles, and partition the net- work into numerous drug network communities by using a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization approach.
As drugs within overlap- ping community share common mechanisms of action, we next un- cover potential targets of drugs by applying a recommendation system on drug communities.
We meanwhile build disease-specific signaling networks based on patients  genomic profiles and interac- tome data.
We then identify drug combinations by searching drugs whose targets are enriched in the complementary signaling modules of the disease signaling network.
The novel method was evaluated on lung adenocarcinoma and endocrine receptor positive breast cancer, and compared with other drug combination approaches.
These case studies discovered a set of effective drug combinations top ranked in our prediction list, and mapped the drug targets on the disease sig- naling network to highlight the mechanisms of action of the drug combinations.

1 INTRODUCTION  Cancers are complex diseases regulated by interactions of mul- tiple signaling pathways interacting with each other.
Though there are some anticancer drugs, they are often not curative and associated with acquired drug resistance.
It is believed that a single drug can target only one disease signaling module, whereas alternative signaling pathways will be activated to main- tain tumor development.
For example, in melanoma, the select- ive BRAF inhibitor, PLX4032, can induce tumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma, but the duration of this response is limited owing to the devel- opment of acquired resistance, which may be due to alternative pathways parallel to the  BRAF-MEK-ERK  signaling pathway (Johannsen et al., 2013  Nazarian et al., 2010).
To reduce the drug resistance effect, and improve cancer treatment outcomes, drug combinations are considered as an optimal option.
it  from a large set of drugs, as  The ideal drug combinations expected by clinicians are com- binations of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or existing bioactive compounds that have entered clinical trials and passed safety tests.
These drug combinations could be used by patients without toxic side effects.
Drug combination prediction has been a challenging task in computational biology, despite a few studies in the area.
The genetic algorithm was, for example, proposed to find the optimal combinations of a small number of drugs based on the experimental results (Zinner et al., 2009).
The method, however, is not able to identify optimal drug combinations requires experimental validations in the prediction process.
The machine learning-based approach was proposed to classify drugs into combinations based on molecular and pharmacological features of drugs (Zhao et al., 2011).
However, the features of drugs are too general to be informative, and the method does not integrate the rich genomic profiles of drugs and disease into consideration.
Combinatorial Drug Assembler (CDA) was developed to iden- tify drug combinations based on enrichment analysis of genomic profile data.
However, the enrichment analysis imple- mented in the method is based on differentially expressed genes, disease driver genes are not clearly defined, so that drugs target- ing the causal dysfunctional signaling modules of disease maybe missed out (Lee et al., 2012).
To overcome the afore- mentioned problems, we propose a novel computational tool, DrugComboRanker, for predicting drug combinations targeting multiple signaling modules of cancer-specific networks through integrative analysis of genomic profiles of both drugs and cancers.

We have thus developed a novel tool, DrugComboRanker, to prioritize drug combinations and uncover the underlying mechanisms of action.
The approach is designed based on the following two observations.
First, dysfunctional signaling networks of diseases are complex and stable, and effective drug combinations can inhibit major modules of the networks simultaneously.
Second, drugs often have multiple active target genes or proteins.
Grouping targets of drugs with similar transcriptional responses profiles allows better recov- ery of their targeted signaling modules in disease than based on indi- vidual the proposed DrugComboRanker.
The drug functional network is firstly reconstructed based on genomic profiling data of drugs that are available in the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database.
The Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization with the  -divergence (BNMF D  Tan and Fevotte, 2013) approach is conducted to partition the drug functional network into connected functional communities, whose targets indicate the inhibited signaling modules of diseases.
On the other hand, the dys- functional signaling modules of diseases are reconstructed by integrating disease genomics data and protein interactome data.
Drug combinations are then ranked from different drug functional communities, which in- hibit disease signaling network modules.
targets alone.
Figure 1 is an overview of  2.2 Drug functional network reconstruction The aim of drug function network reconstruction is to identify drug communities that share common transcriptional responses to drug treat- ment.
We reconstruct, the drug functional network based on the data of the CMAP (CMap, build 02  Lamb et al., 2006), which consists of 6100 gene expression profiles of four cancer cell lines (MCF7, PC3, HL60 and SKMEL5) treated by 1309 drugs at different doses.
We first combine the similarity metric proposed in (Iorio et al., 2010) with the metric defined in the STITCH database (Kuhn et al., 2012) as a new drug similarity metric  Fig.

Overview of the DrugComboRanker for prioritizing disease- specific drug combinations  DrugComboRanker: a tool for drug combination prediction  as follows.
First, for each individual drug at each dose, genes are ranked based on their fold changes (drug treatment versus control).
Then, gene rank lists at different doses are merged into one gene rank list by using a hierarchical majority voting scheme (Iorio et al., 2010).
The merging procedure first compares gene rank lists using the Spearman s Footrule similarity metric (Diaconis and Graham, 1977), and then the two most similar lists are merged repeatedly by using the Borda Merging strategy (Lin, 2010).
Consequently, gene signatures for individual drugs are cre- ated by optimally selecting the top- and bottom-ranked 250 genes, re- spectively.
This size of these signatures is heuristically determined as described in (Iorio et al., 2010).
Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis Þ, is used as the dissimilarity (Subramanian et al., 2005) score, SG i  j metric between drug i and drug j.
A threshold T = 0.7848 (the third quantile of the empirical probability distribution of the drug dissimilarity metric) is given to remove the non-significant dissimilarities as follows:  ð  ( Þ=  ð 0 G i  j S  ð  SG i  j  Þ   ð  if SG i  j  Þ   T  0  C   else  ð 0 G i  :  ð 0 G i  :  Þ where S  ð 0 G i  j Þ=fS  ÞÞ=ðS G i  1ð  and NORMðS ð 0 G i  :  Þ as S ð 00 G i  j ð ÞÞÞ=ðmaxðS 0 G i  : G i  nð Þ  .
.
.
S 0      00 Then we convert the dissimilarity into the normalized similarity score, S Þ ð Þ=1   NORM S Þ ð ð G 0 0 G i  j G i  j i  j  minðS Þ  S ÞÞ   minðS 0 i  2ð Þg denotes all the connection scores linking to the i-th G node.
Here, we empirically set C=10.
In addition to the similarity of transcriptional responses, a different similarity metric, Ssði  jÞ, was defined in STITCH database (Kuhn et al., 2012) by integrating a combined score of structure similarity, experimental similarity and text mining similarity score.
The structure similarity is defined by the Tanimoto 2D chemical similarity scores (Martin et al., 2002).
The experimental similarity is cal- culated by the Pearson correlation of the activity patterns of the com- pounds based on NCI60 screens.
The text mining similarity is computed by mining the curated database, such as OMIM and MEDLINE, using a language processing approach co-occurrence scheme and a natural (Jensen et al., 2006   Saric  et al., 2006).
In this study, we combine the Þ=Ss i  j ð Þ+S Gði  jÞ.
The rational to use two similarity metrics as S i  j the combined similarity is to generate better drug community structure when applying the clustering algorithm on the drug functional network.
Finally, a drug functional network is reconstructed with 1308 nodes and 51 164 edges.
Figure 2 shows an example of the reconstructed drug func- tional network community.
ð  00  2.3 Drug community discovery by using Bayesian non-  negative matrix factorization with  -divergence  Next, we partition the reconstructed drug functional network into com- munities (modules) within which drugs share common mechanisms of action (targeting the same or related signaling modules), as illustrated in Figure 2.
We use the BNMF D (Tan and Fevotte, 2013) for the net- work partition.
The algorithm has shown good partition results on vari- ous classes of real-world signals such as audio and images (Tan and Fevotte, 2013), Specifically, the algorithm can (i) enable soft partitioning (one drug can be partitioned into multiple communities with different membership scores)  (ii) reduce noise influence (suppresses noise in the high dimensional space)  and (iii) allow multi-scale partition.
To the best of our knowledge, the algorithm is for the first time used in drug func- tional network partition.

To infer the appropriate model order K, we use a Bayesian paradigm for non-negative matrix factorization by placing automatic relevance determination priors with scale hyper- parameters k=f kgK k=1 on the variables wik and hkj.
In this model, the distribution of  k is parameterized by fixed parameters a and b, and the fixed parameter   decides the distance measure between the observed interactions V and the expected interactions ^V.

Using the BNMF D approach, we partition the drug functional network into a set of connected network modules (Fig.

2.4 Drug combination discovery based on target network  analysis  The novel drug combination approach consists of the following three major components.
(a) Disease specific signaling network reconstruction Several approaches (Barren as et al., 2012  Chuang et al., 2007  Ideker et al., 2002) have been proposed to reconstruct signaling networks of diseases based on transcritpome and interactome data.
In this study, the approach proposed in (Barren as et al., 2012) is used.
The integrated protein protein interactions from BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006) and the manually curated human cancer signaling from (Awan et al., 2007  Cui et al., 2007  Li et al., 2012  Newman et al., 2013) (available at http://www.
bri.nrc.ca/wang/) are clustered into functional protein protein modules, and each module is tested for enrichment (Fisher s exact test, P50:01) of the differentially expressed genes of the gene expression profile of a dis- ease.
The enriched modules are then considered as disease susceptibility modules, from which the highly interconnected genes are identified as the disease-specific signaling network.
Figure 3 shows the reconstructed sig- naling network of lung adenocarcinoma.
(b) Functional  drug  target  prediction  using  network-based  recommendation  f  Drugs often have multiple targets and affect distinct signaling modules, but only parts of them are known for given drugs.
The drug communities embed targeting signaling modules (functional targets instead of physical targets) of drugs.
To uncover the targeting signaling modules of drugs, we propose a network-based recommendation approach as follows.
Let g denote drugs in a given community, and T= D= d1  d2  .

This drug target network can be represented by an adjacent matrix A= aji n m, where aji is the weight that quantifies the association between di and tj.
Then the novel network- based algorithm is designed based on a bipartite network projection tech- nique (Zhou et al., 2010) as follows.

Targets with recommendation scores greater than given threshold, 0.1, are kept as the active functional targets of given drugs.
(c) Disease-specific drug combination discovery With the constructed disease signaling network and the predicted drug targets, drug combinations are then prioritized by combining the following synergistic scores.

Table 1 lists set a as one of the parameters  10,50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450 , and b to be equal to a.
When a and b are set to be 450, the BNMF D algorithm will converge more quickly.
Under this setting of a and b, we test the drug network community reconstruction results with dif- ferent K and  , as K =  100,110,120,130,140,150,160,170  and  =f1  2g.
When K is 150 and   is 1, we get better drug commu- nity structures in terms of the following defined community qual- ity measurements.
We assign the number from 1 to 150 to each drug community, and obtain the drug target networks by con- necting the drugs in the same community through their targets.
The connected drug target networks provide us a useful way to drug discovery.

To evaluate the quality of the predicted drug community, the fol- lowing three metrics are defined.
The average enrichment score,  SN, is defined as SN=   where si= Pi Ni  , Pi is the number of  drug pairs sharing targets in the i-th drug community, Ni is the number of drugs of that drug community and N is the number of drug community.
Higher SN value indicates more drugs in the same community sharing common targets.

To validate the prediction results, we searched the literature evidence of the top 50 ranked combinations.
Tables 2 4 show the literature evidence of the effective drug combinations in our top 50 lists for lung adenocarcinoma.
Surprisingly, 19 different drug combinations have been reported to be synergistic combining with Gefitinib, Paclitaxel and LY-294002 in non small-cell lung cancer.
Tables 5 and 6 show the literature evidence of ef- fective drug combinations in the top 50 lists for ER-positive breast cancer.
Also 14 different drug combinations have been  reported to be synergistic combining with Tamoxifen and Letrozole.
These results show the strong drug combination pre- diction capacity of DrugComboRanker.
To make the evaluation fair and sound, we further compared the predicted results with CDA, and a random combination method (RCM), which randomly picks up 50 drugs from the available drug lists to combine with the designated drugs.
As for CDA, we picked the top 50 drug combinations with the designated drugs.
Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison results on the lung adenocarcinoma and ER-positive breast cancer in terms of literature supports of those top-ranked 50 drug com- binations, respectively (The numbers on the bars of RCM are standard deviations).
For RCM, we repeated the random selec- tion 100 times  for each simulation, we checked the literature evidence (In total, we checked all the 5000 random combin- ations).
As can be seen, the proposed approach outperforms the CDA and random selection significantly.
The predicted drug targets in the disease-specific network could indicate the molecular mechanism of synergistic drug com- binations.
Here, we map the responsive genes of Gefitinib, Paclitaxel, Vorinostat, LY-294002 and Quercetin to the lung adenocarcinoma-specific signaling network to capture the dis- tinct synergistic responses induced by three agent combinations, Gefitinib and Paclitaxel, LY-294002 and Quercetin, Gefitinib and Vorinostat.
As shown in Figure 7, Gefitinib and Paclitaxel combinations can affect the EGFR signaling pathway (endothe- lial cell proliferation), TP53 signaling pathways, as well as  i233   L.Huang et al.

biological processes, such as cell cycle, apoptosis and the hub genes, i.e.
EGFR, TP53, SRC, FOS, JUN.
Distinctly the LY- 294002 and Quercetin combination affects the alternative EGFR, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT3 pathways, as can be seen in Figure 8.
In addition, the drug combination, Gefitinib and Celecoxib, targets the EGFR and COX-2 signaling pathways, respectively.
The Gefitinib and Celecoxib have distinct transcrip- tional responses that indicate EGFR and COX-2 signaling path- ways are complementary, and have cross talks.
Another example is Gefitinib and Vorinostat combination.
Vorinostat is a Histone deacetylases inhibitor, as shown in Figure 9, which interacts with CTNNB1, and CTNNB1 interacts with E-cadherin, ERBB2 and EGFR, whereas Gefitinib targets on EGFR.
Thus, this combin- ation forms a double inhibition on growth factors.
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  Drug combinations can provide an optimal cancer therapeutic treatment by overcoming acquired drug resistance.
Clinicians usually choose drug combinations manually based on their ex- perience and expertise.
However, this expert-picking-based method cannot be scaled up for discovering drug combinations from a large set of drugs.
The availability of genomic profiles of drugs and patients are informative for uncovering the regulatory signaling networks of cancers and the mechanisms of action of drugs.
However, the computational tools are the bottleneck to interpret and convert the big genomics data into discovery of drug combinations.
In this study, we propose a novel computa- tional tool, DrugComboRanker, to prioritize drug combin- ations for specific cancers by selecting combinations targeting the alternative and complementary signaling modules of disease.
We first predict the functional targets of drugs via the network community analysis of drug functional networks based on their genomic profiles.
We then define the synergistic score of drug combinations that block key disease genes and their potential cross talks.
The new method can also provide insights into mech- anism of actions of drug combinations by mapping the pre- dicted drug targets on the disease signaling network.
In our case studies on lung adenocarcinoma and ER-positive breast cancer cases, a set of top-ranked drug combinations, with similar and distinct mechanisms of action, top-ranked in our predic- tion list have been reported to be effective in anticancer treat- ment.
Moreover, a set of novel drug combinations are also identified with a better anticancer treatment outcome.
In conclu- sion, the DrugComboRanker has the potential to be a widely used software package for predicting new disease-specific drug combinations.
