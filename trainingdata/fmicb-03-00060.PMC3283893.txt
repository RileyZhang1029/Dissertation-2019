The replication and transcription activator (RTA) of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV), K-RTA, is a lytic switch protein that moderates the reactivation process of KSHV
latency. By mass spectrometric analysis of afﬁnity puriﬁed K-RTA, we showed that Thr-513
or Thr-514 was the primary in vivo phosphorylation site. Thr-513 and Thr-514 are proximal to
the nuclear localization signal (527KKRK530) and were previously hypothesized to be target
sites of Ser/Thr kinase hKFC. However, substitutions of Thr with Ala at 513 and 514 had no
effect on K-RTA subcellular localization or transactivation activity. By contrast, replacement
of Ser with Ala at Ser-634 and Ser-636 located in a Ser/Pro-rich region of K-RTA, designated
as S634A/S636A, produced a polypeptide with ∼10 kDa shorter in molecular weight and
reduced transactivation in a luciferase reporter assay relative to the wild type. In contrast
to prediction, the decrease in molecular weight was not due to lack of phosphorylation
because the overall Ser and Thr phosphorylation state in K-RTA and S634A/S636A were
similar, excluding that Ser-634 or Ser-636 motif served as docking sites for consecutive
phosphorylation. Interestingly, S634A/S636A lost ∼30% immuno-reactivity to MPM2, an
antibody speciﬁc to pSer/pThr-Pro motif, indicating that 634SPSP637 motif was in vivo phos-
phorylated. By in vitro kinase assay, we showed that K-RTA is a substrate of CDK9, a
Pro-directed Ser/Thr kinase central to transcriptional regulation. Importantly, the capabil-
ity of K-RTA in associating with endogenous CDK9 was reduced in S634A/S636A, which
suggested that Ser-634 and Ser-636 may be involved in CDK9 recruitment. In agreement,
S634A/S636A mutant exhibited ∼25% reduction in KSHV lytic cycle reactivation relative
to that by the wild type K-RTA. Taken together, our data propose that Ser-634 and Ser-
636 of K-RTA are phosphorylated by host transcriptional kinase CDK9 and such a process
contributes to a full transcriptional potency of K-RTA.

INTRODUCTION
In a cell latently infected with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated her-
pesvirus (KSHV), the switch to viral lytic replication can be
achieved via signals transmitted from interferon-γ, phorbol ester,
HDAC inhibitors, or with the ectopic expression of KSHV repli-
cation and transcription activator, referred to as K-RTA (also
known as ORF50 and Lyta, reviewed in Ganem, 2007). Consecu-
tive expression of KSHV lytic genes induced by either chemicals or
K-RTA has been previously demonstrated (Sarid et al., 1998; Lukac
et al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999; Gradoville et al., 2000; Fakhari and
Dittmer, 2002; Nakamura et al., 2003; Yoo et al., 2005). In addition,
the combination of sodium butyrate plus ectopic K-RTA yielded
synergistic effects in an HEK293 cell background (Vieira and
O’Hearn, 2004). K-RTA interacts with various cellular molecules
involved in the transcription process. These include transcription
factors (POU2F1/Oct-1, Sakakibara et al., 2001; STAT3, Gwack

et al., 2002; RBPJ/CSL, Liang and Ganem, 2003; C/EBPα, Wang
et al., 2003; ZNF426/K-RBP, Yang and Wood, 2007) and chro-
matin modiﬁers/remodelers (CBP, HDAC1, MED12/TRAP230,
SMARCA4; Gwack et al., 2001, 2003a). Depending on the cellular
context and promoters, association of these host factors results in
either activation or repression of K-RTA transactivation activity. It
bears noting that K-RTA-mediated gene regulation is not limited
to the KSHV genome; a number of cellular genes are also mod-
ulated by K-RTA, as evidenced by genome-wide transcriptome
analysis (Chang et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2010). Either on viral or
host genomes, K-RTA requires host RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol
II) for mRNAs synthesis since no RNA polymerase homolog was
found in the KSHV genome.

The process of RNA Pol II-directed transcription can be divided
into four distinct phases: (1) pre-initiation complex formation,
(2) promoter clearance (escape), (3) RNA Pol II stalling at a

CDK9 phosphorylates K-RTA Ser-634/Ser-636

promoter-proximal pausing site, and (4) productive elongation
(Peterlin and Price, 2006; Saunders et al., 2006). The advancement
of the transcription machinery from one stage to the next is tightly
regulated by protein phosphorylation. Speciﬁcally, promoter clear-
ance depends on CDK7-mediated Ser-5 phosphorylation of the
tandem heptapeptide repeats (YSPTSPS) located in the carboxyl
terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II. Next, Ser-5 phosphorylated
CTD undergoes a conformational change that unmasks the Ser-2
in the heptapeptide repeats (YSPTSPS), which serves to recruit
positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb; Lolli, 2009).
P-TEFb not only phosphorylates Ser-2 but also phosphorylates
negative elongation factor complex (NELF and DSIF) by which
RNA Pol II is released from the pausing site and enters the pro-
ductive elongation stage. Accumulating evidence demonstrate that
(cid:2)
RNA Pol II pausing is enriched in the 5
region of genes involved
in central regulatory processes, including developmental switches
that are required for embryogenesis and rapidly inducible mol-
ecules involved in cellular responses to stimuli (Zeitlinger et al.,
2007; Gilchrist et al., 2008). Recently, RNA Pol II pausing was
also documented in controlling the expressions of viral genes
in the KSHV and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) genomes (Kang and
Lieberman, 2011; Palermo et al., 2011).

Because expression of the viral transcriptome is usually RNA
Pol II dependent, hijacking P-TEFb activity by viral molecules
could be advantageous for viral transcription. The ﬁrst example
was in human immunodeﬁciency virus type I (HIV-I). P-TEFb
is composed of a catalytic subunit (CDK9) and a transcription
regulatory cyclin (cyclin T or K). By modifying the substrate speci-
ﬁcity of CDK9, HIV-1 Tat increased noticeably the efﬁciency of
the elongation step during HIV-1 transcription (Garber et al.,
2000; Zhou et al., 2000). By contrast, CDK9 dominant negative
mutants severely impaired HIV-1 replication in cultured human
cells (Foskett et al., 2001; Fujinaga et al., 2002). Furthermore,
CDK9 was recently shown to complex with ICP22 of herpesvirus
type 1 (Durand and Roizman, 2008). The CDK9-bound ICP22
was required for optimal expression of certain viral late genes tran-
scribed by RNA Pol II (Durand and Roizman, 2008). In the case of
human cytomegalovirus, recruitment of cyclin T1 and CDK9 by
IE2 86 kDa protein was critical to establishing an active immediate-
early transcriptome in the ﬁrst 8 h after viral infection (Kapasi and
Spector, 2008; Kapasi et al., 2009). Finally, viral latent promoters
activated by nuclear protein of EBV EBNA2 are enriched with the
CDK9-mediated, elongated form of RNA Pol II (Bark-Jones et al.,
2006).

In addition to moderating components of the RNA Pol II
apparatus, phosphorylation of viral factors also contributes to the
expression of the viral lytic transcriptome. Phosphorylation of Ser-
186 located in the DNA binding domain of EBV BZLF1/ZEBRA is
required for the disruption of EBV latency (Francis et al., 1997).
Such a phosphorylation event is essential to bind and then activate
with high preference methylated EBV immediate-early promoter
(Bhende et al., 2005). In addition, phosphorylation of Ser-167 and
Ser-173 leads BZLF1/ZEBRA to function as a repressor in expres-
sion of one late gene (El-Guindy and Miller, 2004). In human
cytomegalovirus, the phosphorylation status of a Ser-rich domain
encompassing amino acids 258–275 of immediate-early protein
IE2 orchestrates the temporal expression of distinctive viral genes

(Barrasa et al., 2005). Furthermore, the immediate-early protein
ICP0 of human herpesvirus type 1 contains eleven potential phos-
phorylation sites clustered into three regions adjacent to domains
required for transactivation. Mutation of the ﬁrst phosphorylation
region in ICP0 altered its E3 ligase activity that in turn led to virus
replication defect (Boutell et al., 2008).

As every regulator needs to be regulated, in the present study
we focus on the role of phosphorylation in the latent-lytic switch
activity of K-RTA. Previous studies by Lukac et al. (1999) estab-
lished that K-RTA is a highly phosphorylated protein evidenced
by the alleviation of ∼20 kDa molecular mass on SDS-PAGE by
calf intestinal phosphatase treatment. To extend this ﬁnding fur-
ther, we performed computational analysis of K-RTA amino acid
sequence using NetPhosK (Blom et al., 2004) and GPS 2.0 (Xue
et al., 2008) for potential phosphorylation sites, and, Blast search
in various protein databases for homologous protein motifs. We
found: (1) K-RTA is a Ser- and Thr-rich protein (122 of 691,
17.7%) with the most abundant region located at amino acids
500–550 (33%). (2) In addition to multiple PKC and casein kinase
II consensus sites, K-RTA harbors seven potential CDK phospho-
rylation motifs (T449, T540, T628, S634, S636, S644, S650). (3) In
the Human Proteinpedia database, the sequences between amino
acids 633–652 share high homology with an in vivo phosphory-
lated tryptic peptide derived from negative elongation factor B
(NELF-B; Beausoleil et al., 2004; Olsen et al., 2006). In addition,
PredictNLS (Cokol et al., 2000) identiﬁed one nuclear localiza-
tion signal (NLS) in K-RTA, which is equivalent to the NLS-2
designated by Lukac and colleagues (Lukac et al., 1998, 1999;
Bu et al., 2008). Among these predictions, we showed that Ser-
634 and Ser-636 located in the NELF-B homologous region are
involved in CDK9 recruitment and phosphorylation. Substitu-
tions of Ser with Ala at Ser-634 and Ser-636 impaired K-RTA
transactivation activity and altered its electrophoretic mobility on
SDS-PAGE. In addition, CDK9 inhibitors suppressed the expres-
sions of various K-RTA target genes and KSHV viral production
in a HEK293/rKSHV.219 cell model. Together, these results sup-
port an emerging notion that some regions of the latent KSHV
genome are consistently associated with paused RNA Pol II whose
activity can be acutely induced by positive elongation factors such
as CDK9 in response to various stimuli.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PLASMIDS
pLenti4-FLAG-CPO is a gift from Dr. Dan Robinson at MCTP,
University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). pLenti4-FLAG-
CPO is a modiﬁed vector derived from pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST
(Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, the original att R1 site to V5 epitope region
(nt 2405–4203) in pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST was replaced with an in-
frame DNA fragment encoding Kozak sequence, ATG, FLAG tag,
(cid:2)
and a rare cutter CPO I site (5
CGGTCCG). Accordingly, pLenti4-
FLAG-K-RTA was constructed by cloning the coding sequences
of K-RTA (GeneID: 4961526) into the CPO I site of pLenti4-
FLAG-CPO. The expression plasmid pLenti4-FLAG-NLSm was
generated by replacing 527KKRK530 motif of K-RTA with AAAA
in pLenti4-FLAG-K-RTA by QuikChange® site-directed mutage-
nesis kit (Stratagene). Similarly, expression plasmids for the other
NLS and phosphorylation mutants, including NLSm1, NLSm2,

S636T, S636D, S644A, S652A, and S634A/S636A were generated
by using pLenti4-FLAG-K-RTA as template in the QuikChange®
site-directed mutagenesis reactions. In luciferase reporter assays,
the upstream sequences of PAN (nt 28159–28660 of U75698) and
ORF57 (nt 81556–82005) were cloned into SacI–XhoI sites of
pGL3-Basic (Promega), yielding pGL3-Basic-PANp, and pGL3-
Basic-ORF57p, respectively. Expression plasmids for CDK9, dom-
inant negative CDK9 (D167N), and cyclin T have been described
previously (Chang and Li, 2008).

ESTABLISHMENT OF 293TetKR AND 293TetNLSm CONDITIONAL
EXPRESSION CELL LINES
The Tetracycline-Regulated Expression HEK293 (TREx™, Invit-
rogen) cell line were infected with lentivirions harboring pLenti4-
FLAG-K-RTA and pLenti4-FLAG-NLSm by usingViraPower™sys-
tem (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hour after infection, the cells were
selected with 400 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Zeocin-
resistance clones were subjected to doxycycline-inducibility test
for the expression of desired genes by Western blot analysis
using M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). For each condi-
tional expression line, multiple positive clones with similar growth
rate and expression level were pooled, collectively designated as
293TetKR and 293TetNLSm, respectively.

CELLS AND CELL CULTURE
Conditional expression cell
lines 293TetKR and 293TetNLSm
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% Tet System
Approved FBS (Clontech Laboratories), 5 μg/ml blasticidin-S-HCl
(Invitrogen), and 200 μg/ml zeocin. HEK293 was maintained in
DMEM containing 10% FBS. 293/rKSHV.219 was maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 660 ng/ml puromycin
(Becton Dickinson). All cells were grown in a humidiﬁed 37˚C
incubator with 5% CO2.

TRANSFECTION AND LUCIFERASE REPORTER ASSAY
Transfection was performed in 24-well plates. HEK293 cells
(2.4× 105) were seeded into each well to reach a 90% conﬂu-
ence the next day before transfection. Transfection was carried out
using Lipofectamine™2000 (Invitrogen) conveying appropriate
plasmids according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Twenty-
four hour after transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase
activity assay. Fireﬂy and renilla luciferase activities were measured
by using Dual-Glo Lucifearse Assay Kit (Promega). Transfection
efﬁciency was normalized with a cotransfected renilla luciferase
reporter (phRL-TK, Promega).

PROTEIN PURIFICATION AND MASS SPECTROMETRIC ANALYSIS
Immuno-puriﬁcation of FLAG-tagged proteins from 293Tet-
inducible cell lines was carried out according to two previously
described procedures (Barlev et al., 2003; Trester-Zedlitz et al.,
2005) with minor modiﬁcations. Speciﬁcally, 108 cells with 80%
conﬂuence were treated with 50 ng/ml doxycycline for 10 h before
cell harvest. Combined cell pellet (∼1 g) was solubilized in 10 ml of
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors, 0.2 mM sodium ortho-
vanadate) at 4˚C for 40 min with gentle shaking. Protein extracts

were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 12,000× g, 4˚C for 15 min. Col-
lected protein supernatant was further ﬁltrated through a 0.45
micron ﬁlter. The ﬁltrated protein supernatant was applied onto
400 μl anti-FLAG M2 afﬁnity resin (A2220, Sigma-Aldrich) equili-
brated with lysis buffer. The column eluate was re-loaded onto the
column for two more cycles. The column was alternatively washed
with one column volume of TBS (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4) fol-
lowed by one column volume of high salt (500 mM NaCl)–TBS
for three times. The column was washed with additional two col-
umn volumes of TBS buffer prior to elution. The FLAG-tagged
proteins were eluted from the column by TBS buffer supple-
mented with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (F3290, Sigma-Aldrich)
and 20% glycerol. For each puriﬁcation, four eluted fractions
were collected and samples were immediately frozen in −70˚C
for further studies. Approximately 500 ng afﬁnity puriﬁed K-RTA
were resolved in a SDS-PAGE gel, stained with SYPRO® Ruby
(Invitrogen) followed by in-gel digestion. Phosphopeptides were
enriched by C18-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles as described
in Hsiao et al. (2007) followed by LC/MS/MS analysis as described
previously (Lin et al., 2008).

WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS AND CO-IMMUNOPRECIPITATION
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 200 μM sodium orthovana-
date, 1× protease inhibitors, 1× phosphatase inhibitors). The
protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at
562 nm using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA). For each co-immunoprecipitation assay, the cells were lysed
in cold EBC lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40,
120 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride,
200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1× protease inhibitors, 1× phos-
phatase inhibitors). The protein extracts were incubated with
M2 anti-FLAG afﬁnity resin or anti-CDK9 bounded Dynabeads-
protein G (Invitrogen) with continuous rocking at 4˚C overnight.
After centrifugation or magnetic separation, the resin, or beads
were washed thoroughly with TBS (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl) three times followed by elution of immunocom-
plex in 1× sample buffer. Cell lysates or the eluted immuno-
complex were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and analyzed
by Western blotting as described elsewhere (Chen et al., 2011).
For IP-kinase assay (Figures 5A,B), the eluted immunocomplex
were washed three times with TBS and once with kinase buffer
(25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM DTT,
0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ATP). The
immunocomplex were resuspended in 29 μl kinase buffer con-
taining 1 μCi [γ-33P] ATP and incubated at 30˚C for 30 min. After
eluting proteins from resin, the proteins were resolved by SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried, exposed to
an X-ray ﬁlm and developed by autoradiography.

CALF INTESTINAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE TREATMENT
Cells were lysed in EBC lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors
or sodium orthovanadate. For each sample 50 μg of cell extract was
incubated with 60 U calf alkaline phosphatase in buffer 3 (New
England Biolabs) at 37˚C for 45 min. Extracts were separated by
SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis.

IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY
In Figure 1B, 1 day before transfection, cells at a density of
105/0.4 ml/well were seeded on eight-well chamber slide (Nunc)
coated with poly-d-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were trans-
fected with indicated plasmids by using LipofectamineTM 2000
(Invitrogen) and incubated for 24 h. In Figure 2A, cells were pre-
treated with doxycycline for 24 h before assay. Cells were ﬁxed
with acetone/methanol (v/v= 1:1) at −20˚C for 20 min and per-
meablized with 0.4% Triton X-100 at RT for 5 min. The slides
were blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1%
FBS) and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody at RT for 2 h. The
slides were washed with PBS three times for 5 min each. The
slides were incubated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG for 2 h and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-
Aldrich) for 5 min at RT. The slides were observed under a confocal
ﬂuorescence microscope.

SUBCELLULAR FRACTIONATION
Subcellular fractionation was conducted according to a previously
described procedure (Wang et al., 2005). Brieﬂy, cells were incu-
bated with hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M Sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-
100, 1 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitors) on ice for 10 min. Cells
were centrifuged at 1300× g for 4 min at 4˚C. The resulting pellet
was the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged
at 20,000× g for 15 min at 4˚C to remove debris. The resulting
supernatant was the cytosolic fraction.

FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS
After transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and
resuspended in 500 μl PBS. A total of 5,000 cells were acquired
by using a ﬂow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) and
analyzed using the WinMDI v2.8 software. GFP and RFP signals
were detected at 488 and 540 nm, respectively.

TITRATION OF KSHV VIRAL PARTICLES
Filtrated (0.45 μm) viral supernatant (160 μl) was incubated with
2 U DNase I (Invitrogen) at 37˚C for 30 min followed by extrac-
tion of encapsidated KSHV DNA using QIAamp MinElute virus
spin kit (QIAGEN). Each comparative quantitative PCR reaction
was composed of 2 μl diluted viral DNA, 5 μl Power SYBR Green
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 3 μl primer mix (0.66 μM).
The primers used for detecting KSHV genome are ORF9-forward
(cid:2)
(5

). Known copy numbers of seri-
ally diluted cosmid GB11 DNA encompassing KSHV genome nt
1–35,022 (U75698) were used as standards in titrating KSHV
viral particles. The reaction was conducted and detected by

RESULTS
THE KKRK MOTIF OF THE BIPARTITE NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION SIGNAL
CONTRIBUTES TO NUCLEAR TARGETING AND TRANSACTIVATION
ACTIVITY OF K-RTA
Computer-assisted identiﬁcation of the NLS sequence in K-RTA
was achieved using PredictNLS, a program serving to iden-
tify in silico potential NLS present in a given sequence (Cokol
et al., 2000). Accordingly, a prototypic bipartite NLS located at
amino acids 516–530 (KRKQRSKERSSKKRK) was identiﬁed with
97.92% probability (Figure 1A). This subclass of bipartite NLS
can be found in 193 nuclear proteins collected in the PredictNLS
database as of September 2011. In agreement, functional domains

encompassing amino acids 516–530 of K-RTA were recently shown
to be a bona ﬁde NLS (Bu et al., 2008) or to possess inhibitory
effects on DNA binding (Chang et al., 2008). Noteworthy, Chen
et al. (2000) showed that amino acids 6–12 of K-RTA, designated
as NLS-1 in Lukac’s et al. (1998) publication, was demonstrated to
be a functional NLS when fused to β-Gal protein, and, is required
for efﬁcient nucleus-targeting since product of genomic ORF50
devoid of NLS-1 tends to localize to both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm. This ﬁnding suggests that NLS-1 can serve as a cryp-
tic NLS and may participate in correct folding of K-RTA that is
required for the exposure of the C-terminal bipartite NLS.

Alignment of amino acids 516–530 with the NLS derived from
EBV Rta (Hsu et al., 2005), a functionally homologous protein
to K-RTA, revealed little similarity except for the last four basic
residues (Figure 1A). To characterize further which of the two
basic motifs is responsible for nuclear localization, the Lys and
Arg located at amino acids 516–518 and 527–530, respectively,
were mutated to Ala (Figure 1A). Subcellular localization of K-
RTA and NLS mutants was inspected by an immunoﬂuorescence
assay. As shown in Figure 1B, NLSm and NLSm2 were clearly
retained in the cytoplasm, indicating that the mutation of the sec-
ond basic motif composed of KKRK is the determinant of nuclear
targeting. By contrast, modiﬁcation of the ﬁrst basic motif from
KRK to AAA did not seem to interfere with the nuclear target-
ing of K-RTA, as represented by NLSm1. In addition, compared
with the wild type that was estimated to be 114 kDa in size, muta-
tion of the second basic motif consistently yielded more abundant
but shorter 98/100 kDa doublet bands in Western blot analysis
(Figure 1C). To assess whether mutations affect the transactiva-
tion capability of K-RTA, a luciferase reporter assay using ORF57
promoter sequences was performed. Again, mutation in the sec-
ond (NLSm and NLSm2), but not in the ﬁrst (NLSm1) basic motif
showed a dramatic decrease (50–60%) in transactivation activity
(Figure 1D). A similar result was obtained in a PAN promoter-
driven luciferase reporter assay (data not shown). Collectively,
these results revealed that the second basic motif KKRK of the
bipartite NLS is responsible for the targeting of K-RTA to the
nucleus and the full potency of transactivation, and is involved in
regulating protein abundance. Because NLSm requires the least
changes in altering subcellular localization, it was used as the
cytoplasmic version of K-RTA in the following studies.

K-RTA IS PHOSPHORYLATED IN BOTH CYTOPLASM AND NUCLEUS
The most probable explanation for the 14 kDa difference between
K-RTA and NLSm was that it is caused by different extents of phos-
phorylation taking place in different compartments of the cell. To
corroborate this hypothesis, cell lines conditionally expressing K-
RTA and NLSm were established by using the Virapower system
(Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, TREx-293TM cells were stably transduced
with a lentiviral-based plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged K-RTA
or NLSm under the control of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible
promoter, CMVTetO2™. The resulting cell lines were designated
as 293TetKR and 293TetNLSm, respectively. As expected, upon
Dox treatment, K-RTA was found predominantly in the nucleus
of 293TetKR cells using an immunoﬂuorescence assay, while
NLSm was largely conﬁned to the cytoplasm of 293TetNLSm cells
(Figure 2A, left). The protein extracts of Dox-treated 293TetKR

and 293TetNLSm cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation
followed by Western blot analysis. Clearly, the 114 kDa polypep-
tide and the 98/100 kDa protein bands existed in distinct fractions:
the 114 kDa was exclusively in the nucleus and the 98/100 kDa
doublet in the cytoplasm (Figure 2A, middle). Further, when
protein extract was pre-treated with calf intestinal alkaline phos-
phatase (CIP), which should remove most of the phosphate groups
attached to K-RTA and NLSm, both molecules were converted to
a single 98 kDa species (Figure 2A, right). These results indicated
that the non-phosphorylated forms of K-RTA and NLSm were
similar, yet compartmental phosphorylation processes contribute
to their individual molecular masses. Thereby, we hypothesized
that K-RTA is mildly phosphorylated in the cytoplasm as indi-
cated by the smaller, 98/100 kDa doublet polypeptides, and is
further phosphorylated once it enters the nucleus as indicated by
the mature 114 kDa protein.

IDENTIFICATION BY MASS SPECTROMETRY OF Thr-513 AND Thr-514 AS
THE PRIMARY IN VIVO PHOSPHORYLATION MOTIF IN K-RTA
In order to conclusively identify which residues are phospho-
rylated in vivo, afﬁnity puriﬁed 114 kDa K-RTA and 100 kDa
NLSm derived from Dox-treated 293TetKR and 293TetNLSm cells,
respectively, were subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis (Figure 2B). It
was expected that there would be more phosphorylated residues
identiﬁed in the 114 kDa nuclear K-RTA than in the 100 kDa cyto-
plasmic NLSm. Disappointedly, the same results were obtained
from both analyses: Thr-513 or Thr-514 located in the tryptic pep-
tides encompassing amino acids 502–516 (DSTAAATAAEATTPK)
of K-RTA and NLSm were the only amino acids with phosphate
potentially conjugated to them. Of these two residues, Thr-513 is
more likely to serve as an alternative position for phosphate mod-
iﬁcation (Figure 2B, detailed in the legend). From these results,
we can conclude that Thr-513 or Thr-514 is preferentially phos-
phorylated in the cytoplasm (NLSm), and this modiﬁed status is
retained in the nucleus (K-RTA).

Next, the role of phosphorylated Thr-513 or Thr-514 in K-
RTA activity was assessed by biological assays using three Ala
substitution mutants, which mimic the non-phosphorylated state
of 513 and 514. The three variants were primarily localized in
the nucleus and the protein expression levels and molecular
weights of the three variants were comparable to those of the
wild type K-RTA by Western blot analysis (data not shown).
A luciferase reporter assay using upstream sequences of KSHV
PAN RNA was performed to quantitate the transactivation activ-
ity of each Ala variant. No signiﬁcant difference was observed
between any Ala mutant and the wild type K-RTA (not shown).
These results suggested that that phosphorylation of Thr-513 and
Thr-514 might play only an ancillary role in K-RTA activity.
Interestingly, Gwack et al. (2003b) noted previously that Ser-
503, Thr-504, Thr-508, Thr-513, and Thr-514 are ﬁve potential
phosphorylation sites for a Ste20-like kinase hKFC, and that phos-
phorylation of K-RTA by hKFC resulted in a negative effect in
K-RTA-mediated transactivation. Thus, our results excluded the
possibility that Thr-513 or Thr-514 is an hKFC target site. Taken
together, although located proximal to NLS and a DNA bind-
ing inhibitory/protein abundance regulatory signal (Figure 2C),
defective in phosphorylation of Thr-513 or Thr-514 has little

inﬂuence in K-RTA nuclear localization, transcriptional activation,
or protein abundance.

IDENTIFICATION OF AN NELF-B HOMOLOGOUS MOTIF IN THE
C-TERMINUS OF K-RTA
In order to explore the existence of phosphorylated Ser or Thr
residues that had been missed by mass spectrometry (MS; dis-
cussed below), computer-assisted Blast search was employed
to look for known phosphorylated tryptic peptides that share
sequence similarity with K-RTA. Brieﬂy, amino acid sequences
of several large tryptic peptides derived from K-RTA were used as

queries to ﬁnd hits using a pre-calculated position-speciﬁc score
matrix in the NCBI Conserved Domain database as described by
Marchler-Bauer et al. (2005). Amino acids 633–652 were found
to share signiﬁcant homology with an in vivo phosphorylated
tryptic peptide encompassing amino acids 554–573 of NELF-B
(Figure 3A). NELF-B is one of the ﬁve negative elongation factors
that control the processivity of RNA Pol II on an active promoter.
The in vivo phosphorylation sites of NELF-B have been identiﬁed
previously to be located at Ser-557, Thr-564, and Ser-573 (Beau-
soleil et al., 2004; Olsen et al., 2006), which were aligned to K-RTA
Ser-636, Ser-644, and Ser-652, respectively (Figure 3A). Although

CDK9 phosphorylates K-RTA Ser-634/Ser-636

the role of phosphorylated Ser-557, Thr-564, and Ser-573 in NELF-
B is still unclear, it was tempting to presume that the conserved
residues in K-RTA are also phosphorylated. To test our hypoth-
esis, Ser to Ala point mutation was individually introduced into
K-RTA Ser-636, Ser-644, and Ser-652 (Figure 3A). In addition, we
initially included S634A as a control variant since no conserved
Ser was matched in the corresponding site of NELF-B. We ﬁrst
conﬁrmed that all four Ser to Ala mutants correctly resided in
the nucleus of HEK293 cells (data not shown). Next, the protein
expression level of each mutant was compared by Western blot
analysis in parallel with that of wild type K-RTA. Noteworthy, the
major bands in S634A and S636A, but not in S644A and S652A
were estimated to be 104 kDa, approximately 10 kDa shorter than
that of the wild type (Figure 3B, compare lanes 1, 2, 5, 8, 9).
To investigate further, Ser to Thr, Ser to Asp, and double Ser to
Ala substitutions were introduced into amino acids 634 and 636,
yielding S634T, S634D, S636T, S636D, and S634A/S636A. Simi-
larly, each mutant was shown by an immunoﬂuorescence assay
to localize in the nucleus (data not shown). Interestingly, the
discrepancy in molecular mass in S634A and S636A could be par-
tially or completely overcome by substitution of a functionally
conserved residue (e.g., S634T and S636T) or with a phosphory-
lation mimetic residue (e.g., S634D and S636D), suggesting that
phosphorylation of Ser-634 or Ser-636 is involved in migration
mobility of K-RTA (Figure 3B, lanes 3, 4, 6, 7). To corroborate the
molecular mass discrepancy with transactivation potential, a PAN
promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay was performed to com-
pare transactivation activity of K-RTA and the nine Ser-634 and
Ser-636 variants. As summarized in Figure 3B (lower panel), the
transactivation activities were 8–27% lower in S634A, S636A, and
S634A/S636A relative to that of the wild type and other variants.
Although the reductions were small, these results mirrored those
observed for migration mobility, namely substitution of Ser with
Ala at 634 or 636 produced a 104 kDa species of K-RTA that is less
potent. Because S634A/S636A yielded the most apparent changes
in migration pattern and transactivation activity, this mutant was
chosen for further investigation.

To extend these studies to cells infected with KSHV, K-RTA,
and S634A/S636A, respectively, were ectopically expressed in
293/rKSHV.219 cells (Vieira and O’Hearn, 2004), followed by
scoring of the percentage of GFP and RFP double positive cells,
an indicator of KSHV lytic reactivation (Vieira and O’Hearn,
2004). The results showed that lytic reactivation induced by K-
RTA was impaired when Ser-634 and Ser-636 were replaced with
Ala, either by scoring of PAN promoter activity or by detecting K-
bZIP expression (Figure 3C). This defect in lytic cycle reactivation
of S634A/S636A was further validated by quantitative RT-PCR
analysis of additional lytic genes (ORF2, ORF36, and ORF59)
and determination of viral particles released in the culture media
(Figure 3D). Thereby, we provide evidence indicating that phos-
phorylation of Ser-634 and Ser-636 contributes to the full potency
of K-RTA in lytic cycle reactivation and virus production.

Taken together, we found that amino acids 633–652 of K-
RTA shares 70% homology with a phosphorylated tryptic peptide
derived from NELF-B. Among the three conserved Ser residues
between K-RTA and NELF-B, Ser-636 seemed to play a role
in K-RTA migration mobility and transactivation activity. In

conjunction with Ser-634, Ser to Ala substitutions resulted in
∼25% decrement in K-RTA activity and was ∼10 kDa smaller in
molecular weight.

K-RTA 634SPSP637 IS A POTENTIAL CDK9 TARGET SITE
At ﬁrst, we hypothesized that the 10 kDa decrease in molecular
mass of S634A/S636A was caused by a deﬁciency in phosphory-
lation, namely Ser-634 or Ser-636 may serve as a priming site to
“dock” kinase(s), after which a successive, extensive phosphory-
lation is initiated. Thus, given a phosphate group is 80 Da, the
10 kDa difference could be attributed to as many as 125 phos-
phates conjugating onto K-RTA, but not to the S634A/S636A
mutant; that is, the overall phosphorylation state in K-RTA should
be higher than that in S634A/S636A. To validate this hypothesis,
protein extracts of HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-
tagged K-RTA or S634A/S636A were treated with CIP and analyzed
against their untreated counterparts by SDS-PAGE and Western
blot analysis. As expected, CIP converted the majority of K-RTA
and S634A/S636A to a 98 kDa species (Figure 4A). To determine
the overall phosphorylation state in K-RTA vs. S634A/S636A,
protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with M2 FLAG resin
followed by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho Ser or
anti-phospho Thr antibodies (Figure 4B). After normalized with
the total protein (α-FLAG), the overall phosphorylation status
of K-RTA and S634A/S636A was very similar. Taken together,
these results refuted our hypothesis that the 10 kDa difference
was caused by a deﬁciency in the degree of phosphorylation in
S634A/S636A.

FIGURE 4 | The 10-kDa difference between K-RTA and S634A/S636A is
not due to distinct global phosphorylation state. (A) Protein extract
from HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing K-RTA or
S634A/S636A for 24 h was incubated with (+) or without (−) calf intestinal
phosphatase (CIP) at 37˚C for 45 min. Each reaction mixture was analyzed in
parallel by Western blot analysis using speciﬁed antibodies. Phosphorylated
MAPK served as a control for completeness of CIP treatment. (B) The
overall Ser phosphorylation (α-pSer), Thr phosphorylation (α-pThr), and
MPM2 reactivity of K-RTA and S634A/S636A were revealed by
immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western blot analysis. Because the expression
abundance of each species were varied, the intensity of each band was ﬁrst
normalized with the intensity of its corresponding FLAG polypeptide
(α-FLAG), followed by comparing to the normalized K-RTA value that was
set to 1.

CDK9 phosphorylates K-RTA Ser-634/Ser-636

On the other hand, we noticed that 634SPSP637 of K-RTA rep-
resents a canonical motif of MPM2, an antibody that recognizes
the phosphorylated Ser-Pro or phosphorylated Thr-Pro motifs
present on a polypeptide, we tested whether mutation of this
motif (634APAP637 in S634A/S636A) would inﬂuence its immuno-
reactivity to MPM2 antibody. Indeed, as shown in Figure 4B,
S634A/S636A retained ∼70% immuno-reactivity of MPM2 anti-
body relative to K-RTA by IP-Western blot analysis. This result
suggested that 634SPSP637 could be an in vivo phosphorylation
site. Because 634SPSP637 also represents a typical motif for Pro-
directed kinases including various CDKs, an in vitro translation
(IVT) coupled IP-kinase assay was performed to identify potential
CDKs that phosphorylate Ser-634 or Ser-636. As a result, phos-
phorylation of K-RTA was detectable when CDK1, 2, or 9 were
used as kinase source (not shown). Among these, we were particu-
larly interested in CDK9 because it belongs to transcriptional CDK
families that tightly control the conformation and processivity of
RNA Pol II and negative elongation factor complex, NELF, and
DSIF (Lolli, 2009).

First, by in vitro IP-kinase assay, we conﬁrmed that CDK9,
but not its dominant negative variant (CDK9-D167N) specif-
ically phosphorylated K-RTA in vitro (Figure 5A). To inspect
whether Ser-634 or Ser-636 were the target sites of CDK9, IP-kinase
assays of K-RTA, and S634A/S636A were performed in parallel.
As depicted in Figure 5B, although CDK9 phosphorylated both
species, CDK9 phosphorylated higher fraction of K-RTA than that
of S634A/S636A (1:0.4), strongly indicating that the 634SPSP637
motif could be one of the multiple CDK9 sites present in K-
RTA. If this were true, we envisioned that in vivo, interaction
between CDK9 and K-RTA would be stronger than that between
CDK9 and S634A/S636A. As anticipated, results of IP-Western
blot analysis revealed that higher fraction of K-RTA associated
with CDK9 relative to that of S634A/S636A (1: 0.4, Figure 5C).
The involvement of CDK9 in Ser-634 and Ser-636 phospho-
rylation was further supported by using DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-
beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) and roscovitine in a PAN
promote-driven luciferase reporter assay. DRB and roscovitine are
well-characterized CDK9 inhibitors (Taylor et al., 2004; Kapasi
et al., 2009). When used as a dosage that did not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence general transcription (evidenced by negligible changes
in rellina activities of transfection controls, expressions of FLAG
protein and β-actin between the control and the drugged groups,
not shown), S634A/S636A was less sensitive to CDK9 inhibitors
compared to K-RTA (Figure 5D), reinforcing that 634SPSP637
is an in vivo target site of CDK9. To extend these studies to
cells infected with KSHV, K-RTA expressing 293/rKSHV.219 cells
were treated with vehicle control (DMSO), DRB, or roscovitine
for 42 h before harvest. RNAs of each group were subjected to
quantitative RT-PCR analysis for various K-RTA target genes. As
shown in Figure 5E, while the expressions of β-actin or RNA
Pol III-directed 18S ribosomal RNA were insensitive to CDK9
inhibitors, the expression of MYC was signiﬁcantly suppressed
by DRB or roscovitine treatment, which is consistent with previ-
ous ﬁnding that MYC is a prototypic RNA Pol II pausing gene
whose expression is regulated by CDK9-related pathway (Romano
and Giordano, 2008). Notably, DRB and roscovitine also down-
regulated the expressions of known K-RTA target genes (cellular

SERPINB1; Brown et al., 2010, PAN, K-bZIP, and ORF59) and
decreased the amount of viral particles released in the culture
media, reinforcing the positive regulatory role of CDK9 in K-RTA-
mediated transactivation and virus production. Taken together,
we showed that although both K-RTA and S634A/S636A were
phosphorylated in vitro by CDK9, S634A/S636A only retained
40% intensity of phosphorylation compared to that in K-RTA;
both K-RTA and S634A/S636A associated with CDK9 in vivo,
yet S634A/S636A only preserved 40% recruitment capacity rel-
ative to that of K-RTA; CDK9 inhibitors, DRB, and roscovi-
tine, displayed higher inhibition potency on K-RTA than that of
S634A/S636A. We conclude that there are multiple CDK9 target
sites on K-RTA and 634SPSP637 motif is highly likely to be one
of them.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of
K-RTA can be subsidiary to (at Thr-513 and Thr-514) or inﬂuen-
tial in (at Ser-634 and Ser-636) the biological activity of K-RTA.
We showed that mutation of 634SPSP637 to 634APAP637 in K-RTA
reduced its capacity in CDK9 recruitment and potency in viral
lytic cycle reactivation. Because CDK9 is central to regulating the
RNA Pol II processivity on active promoters, we propose that sim-
ilar to HIV Tat, by recruiting CDK9 to the viral genome K-RTA has
evolved to potentiate the host transcription machinery for a robust
viral transcriptome expression during lytic cycle replication.

Among the multiple mechanisms that control RNA Pol II activ-
ity in a transcription cycle, promoter-proximal pausing/stalling of
RNA Pol II is considered as a rate-limiting step in the activation
of hundreds of genes responding to dynamic environmental and
developmental cues (Muse et al., 2007; Zeitlinger et al., 2007). In
addition, genome-wide epigenetic analysis of human cells revealed
that although only ∼30–45% of known genes have detectable
transcripts, the majority of protein-coding genes are with active
chromatin marks (K3K4me3) and bound with low level of RNA
Pol II in the regions surrounding their promoters (Guenther et al.,
2007). Interestingly, recent epigenetic studies revealed similar phe-
nomena in the KSHV genome that it is also dynamically marked
with both active and suppressive chromatin marks during latent
infection, indicating that the KSHV genome is transcriptionally
poised during latency, but can be rapidly activated in response to
lytic cycle inducers (Gunther and Grundhoff, 2010; Toth et al.,
2010).

The negative elongation factor (NELF) is a transcription regu-
latory complex comprises four subunits, NELF-A, B, C/D, and E.
NELF exerts to interact stably with RNA Pol II and other elon-
gation regulatory factors within the promoter-proximal region,
which prevents further transcription elongation. Recently, a novel
role of NELF was revealed: by residing at the pausing site, NELF
prevents nucleosome formation and maintains a permissive chro-
matin architecture that allows a rapid transcription process upon
induction. Thus, NELF-mediated RNA Pol II pausing can provide
both negative and positive effects on gene expression (Gilchrist
et al., 2008). Regardless of which effect, phosphorylation of NELF
by CDK9 enables the disengagement of NELF from the promoter-
proximal region that is followed by a productive elongation
process.

S634A/S636A relative to that in K-RTA, suggesting that wild type K-RTA is a
better substrate for CDK9. (C) Phosphorylation of Ser-634 and Ser-636 may
play a role in CDK9 recruitment. Association of K-RTA and S634A/S636A
with cellular CDK9 was determined by IP-Western blot analysis using
α-CDK9 bounded Dynabeads-protein G. After normalized with the input
proteins (lanes 1 and 2), S634A/S636A only retained 40% in CDK9
association ability, suggesting that Ser-634 ad Ser-636 are involved in CDK9
recruitment. (D) The effects of DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-
ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) and roscovitine on K-RTA-mediated

transactivation of PAN promoter were determined by a luciferase reporter
assay. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing K-RTA or
S634A/S636A together with PANp-driven luciferase reporter plasmid for 6 h,
followed by inhibitor treatments for 18 h. Each ﬁreﬂy luciferase value was
normalized to an internal control plasmid phRL-TK. The normalized value of
the untreated group in K-RTA was set to 1. Data are presented as the
means± SD for quadruplicate transfections. Similar pattern was observed in
two independent experiments. One set of data is shown. Statistical
evaluations were performed with Student’s t-test. (E) (Left) quantitative
RT-PCR analysis for gene expressions of β-actin (ACTB), 18S ribosomal RNA
(18S RNA), known RNA Pol II pausing gene (MYC), and K-RTA target genes

293/rKSHV.219 cells treated with indicated inhibitors for 42 h.
GADPH-normalized RNA value was quantiﬁed as fold change over the
DMSO group. Statistical evaluations were performed by using Student’s
t-test. (Right) KSHV viral particles released in the culture media from each
treated groups were determined by comparative quantitative PCR of KSHV
ORF9, as described in Figure 3D. Data are presented as means± SD for
three PCR assays in an experiment. Similar results were obtained from two
independent experiments; one set of data is shown.

Here, we found that amino acids 633–652 of K-RTA share
sequence homology with amino acids 554–573 of NELF-B, which
is located in an in vivo phosphorylated tryptic peptide (554–
580). Although the kinase that phosphorylates this tryptic pep-
tide in NELF-B has not been characterized, we found that
Ser-634 and Ser-636 in K-RTA are involved in CDK9 recruit-
ment/phosphorylation and the expressions of multiple K-RTA
target genes were impaired when CDK9 inhibitors were present.
In addition, de-phosphorylated Ser-634 and Ser-636 mimetic,
namely S634A/S636A, is 10 kDa shorter than the wild type,

however, this decrement in molecular mass was not due to deﬁ-
ciency in global Ser- or Thr-phosphorylation, which raises a
possibility that phosphorylation-mediated conformational change
might be involved. Along the same vein, S634A/S636A was less
immunoreactive to MPM2 antibody, suggesting that phosphory-
lation of 634SPSP637 could be targeted by PIN1, a peptidyl-prolyl
cis/trans isomerase that regulates the conformation and func-
tion of numerous MPM2-recognized proteins (Stukenberg and
Kirschner, 2001; Lu and Zhou, 2007; Shaw, 2007). More exper-
iments are required to prove this hypothesis. Taken together, it

CDK9 phosphorylates K-RTA Ser-634/Ser-636

is envisioned that K-RTA possesses functional domain similar
to those in NELF, which serves to recruit CDK9 and assures a
productive gene expression program on the viral genome.

Although K-RTA has been known as a nuclear protein, the
full maturation process of K-RTA may involve multiple cellu-
lar compartments. To distinguish various compartment-speciﬁc
phosphorylation processes, we constructed a nuclear localization
mutant of K-RTA, referred to as NLSm. While primarily located
in the cytoplasm by immunoﬂuorescence assays, NLSm retained
50% wild type transactivation activity (Figure 1D). There are two
possibilities to account for this result. First, a proportion of NLSm
may“sneak into”the nucleus in the overwhelming liposomal trans-
fection used in the luciferase reporter assay. This possibility is
supported by the presence of the 114 kDa nuclear polypeptide
in protein extracts of long term (24 h) Dox-treated NLSm cells
(Figure 2A, middle). Alternatively, NLSm could exert some yet-
to-be-identiﬁed actions in the cytosol. For example, EBV Rta was
documented to be functional in the cytoplasm (Hsu et al., 2005).
Originally, we anticipated to see more phosphorylated residues
in the 114 kDa nuclear form of K-RTA because of its apparently
larger molecular mass. To our surprise, the same Thr-513 and
Thr-514 were shown to be the only phosphorylated amino acids
identiﬁed in both K-RTA and NLSm by LC/MS/MS. Two possibil-
ities could contribute to this result. One is that our MS analysis
may exclude some larger tryptic peptides because of their size
(e.g., amino acids 531–633, approximately 10.6 kDa, contain 25
Ser/Thr). The other possibility is that we did not obtain adequate
quantity of phosphorylated K-RTA in the ﬁrst place. We believe
that further improvement of the puriﬁcation procedure, or the
use of alternative proteases such as chymotrypsin to supplement

the trypsin digestion, will help to identify more phosphorylated
sites in the mature 114 kDa K-RTA by MS. Nonetheless, in the
present study we show that Thr-513 or Thr-514 is the preferred
phosphorylation site in K-RTA that is modiﬁed in the cytoplasmic
compartment and retained in the nucleus.

In summary, hijacking of host transcription machinery, includ-
ing CDK9, by the virus to express its own transcriptome is increas-
ingly documented (Garber et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2000; Bark-
Jones et al., 2006; Durand and Roizman, 2008; Kapasi and Spector,
2008; Kapasi et al., 2009). Our ﬁnding that K-RTA-mediated tran-
scriptional activation is impaired by two CDK9 inhibitors provides
a new example of this paradigm. Interestingly, the CDK inhibitor
R-roscovitine (also known as seliciclib and CYC202) was used
recently to reduce tumor size and plasma EBV DNA in patients
with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Hsieh et al., 2009). Thus, the
application of CDK9 inhibitors to disturb virus replication may
provide a promising direction for treatment of viral malignancies
including Kaposi’s sarcoma.
