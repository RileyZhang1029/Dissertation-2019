Hantaviruses, of the family Bunyaviridae, are present throughout the world and cause a
variety of infections ranging from the asymptomatic to mild and severe hemorrhagic fevers.
Hantaviruses are enveloped anti-sense RNA viruses that contain three genomic segments
that encode for a nucleocapsid protein, two membrane glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and
an RNA polymerase. Recently, the pathogenicity of hantaviruses has been mapped to the
carboxyl end of the 150 residue Gn cytoplasmic tail. The Gn tail has also been shown to
play a role in binding the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), a step critical for virus assembly. In this
study, we use NMR spectroscopy to compare the structure of a Gn tail zinc ﬁnger domain
of both a pathogenic (Andes) and a non-pathogenic (Prospect Hill) hantavirus. We demon-
strate that despite a stark difference in the virulence of both of these viruses, the structure
of the Gn core zinc ﬁnger domain is largely conserved in both strains. We also use NMR
backbone relaxation studies to demonstrate that the regions of the Andes virus Gn tail
immediately outside the zinc ﬁnger domain, sites known to bind the RNP, are disordered
and ﬂexible, thus intimating that the zinc ﬁnger domain is the only structured region of
the Gn tail. These structural observations provide further insight into the role of the Gn tail
during viral assembly as well as its role in pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Infection by a hantavirus can occur by inhalation of aerosolized
urine or excrement from an infected rodent, thus leading a wide
range of hemorrhagic fevers. European and Asian strains, for
example, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS),
which is fatal in 1–15% of patients (Khaiboullina et al., 2005). The
American strains, by contrast, cause the more severe hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which is more aggressive and
carries up to 40% mortality rate (Khaiboullina et al., 2005). Per-
haps even more interesting are the two well known hantaviruses
non-pathogenic to humans: Tula virus (present in European com-
mon voles) and the Prospect Hill virus (PHV; present in the
American meadow vole; Mackow and Gavrilovskaya, 2009). In
general, pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses appear to
have a similar organization. They are enveloped and contain an
anti-sense segmented RNA genome composed of a small (S) seg-
ment, medium (M) segment, and large (L) segment (Elliott et al.,
2000). These in turn encode for the viral nucleocapsid protein, a
glycoprotein polyprotein (subsequently processed into Gn and Gc
proteins), and the RNA polymerase, respectively. RNA segments
are bound to repeating trimers of the nucleocapsid protein into an
assembled ribonucleocapsid (RNP) particle (Elliott et al., 2000).
As do most of the hantavirus structural proteins, the Gn gly-
coprotein has multiple functions in the viral replication cycle. As
part of the virus envelope, it forms the structural core of a spike
complex that consists of a multimeric arrangement of Gn and Gc

glycoproteins, with a Gn tetramer at the center of the complex
(Hepojoki et al., 2010a). On the cytoplasmic side of this com-
plex, the inward facing 150 residue Gn cytoplasmic tail associates
with the RNP during viral assembly (Hepojoki et al., 2010b,c;
Wang et al., 2010; Battisti et al., 2011). Previously, we reported
that a conserved array of cysteine and histidine residues (the dual
CCHC motifs) within the Andes virus Gn tail folds into a compact
dual ββα-type zinc ﬁngers (Estrada et al., 2009a; Estrada and De
Guzman, 2011). While ββα-type zinc ﬁngers are primarily known
for binding nucleic acids, the core zinc ﬁnger domain formed by
57-residues of the Andes virus Gn tail (residues 543–599) did
not bind RNA in vitro (Estrada et al., 2009a), thus suggesting a
role in protein–protein binding during the Gn–RNP interaction.
Recently, Hepojoki et al. (2010c) showed that the Gn tail does
bind the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the principal component of
the RNP. Speciﬁcally, they showed that residues ﬂanking the core
zinc ﬁnger domain contain three binding sites (Binding sites 1, 2,
and 3, Figure 1) for the N-protein (Hepojoki et al., 2010c). Oth-
ers showed that the proper folding of the zinc ﬁnger domain was
required for the ability of the Gn cytoplasmic tail to interact with
the N-protein (Wang et al., 2010). These data strongly suggest a
role for Gn tail in mediating an interaction with the N-protein.

Additionally, the Gn tails of hantaviruses also participate in
determination of virulence, speciﬁcally by helping to modulate
the host cell immune response to infection (Geimonen et al.,
2003b; Alff et al., 2006, 2008). The non-pathogenic PHV tail fails

to co-precipitate tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
3 (TRAF3), as is the case for the New York hantavirus (Alff et al.,
2008). TRAF3 is a key component of the host cell’s interferon
response to viral infection. In addition, the Gn tail of PHV was
found not to be degraded, as is the case for typical pathogenic han-
taviruses (Sen et al., 2007). However, the mutations of four residues
at the carboxyl terminus of the Gn tail effectively targeted the PHV
tail for proteasomal degradation (Sen et al., 2007). The observa-
tion of a virulence contribution by the Gn tail raises the possibility
of potentially important differences between the predicted dual
CCHC-type zinc ﬁnger domain of PHV and the structure deter-
mined for the pathogenic Andes virus (Estrada et al., 2009a). The
two Gn tails overall are highly conserved between both viruses
(75% identity, 84% similarity for the entire tail; 70% identity, 77%
similarity for the zinc ﬁnger domain alone; Figure 1).

In this study, we used 2D and 3D NMR spectroscopy to com-
pare the structures of two constructs representing segments of the
cytoplasmic Gn tail for both a pathogenic (Andes virus) and a
non-pathogenic hantavirus (PHV). Our NMR data suggests that,
similar to the Andes virus, the dual CCHC motif of PHV forms
an independently folded zinc binding domain. The Cα secondary
chemical shifts of the PHV zinc ﬁnger domain are remarkably
similar to those of the Andes structure, suggesting there is no
appreciable difference in the two structures. These ﬁndings fur-
ther support reports that the virulence determinants are located
further toward the C-terminal end of the Gn tails. Furthermore,
we also report the backbone assignment of an extended form of
the Andes virus Gn tail (76 residues, from residues 534–610) that
includes all of RNP Binding site 2 and part of RNP Binding site
1 (Figure 1). We demonstrate that Binding site 2 includes a short
helix, while Binding site 1 appears to be largely disordered. Our
results of NMR backbone dynamics indicate that both binding
sites are ﬂexible and undergo motion on a faster timescale than that
of the core zinc ﬁnger domain. This enhanced motion may confer
some degree of modularity in binding a crowded RNP complex.
Taken together, these results provide novel structural insight into
both the structural and immunogenic functions of the hantavirus
Gn cytoplasmic tail.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION
For NMR data collection, the soluble Gn construct spanning
residues 534–610 of the Andes virus Gn cytoplasmic tail (GenBank

#AF291703) and residues 548–602 of the PHV Gn tails (GenBank
#X55129) were expressed as fusion proteins with the Streptococ-
cal GB1 domain linked with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) pro-
tease cleavage site (Estrada et al., 2009b). The fusion proteins
were expressed and puriﬁed under native conditions following
closely the method reported previously for the Andes virus zinc
ﬁnger domain (Estrada et al., 2009b). Brieﬂy, 15N- and 15N/13C-
labeled proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) grown in
1 L M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.1 mM ZnSO4 before
and after induction. Cells were grown at 37˚C, induced with
1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 ∼ 0.8, and cell
growth was continued in a 15˚C shaker overnight (to a ﬁnal
A600 ∼ 2.0). Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in nickel col-
umn binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl,
5 mM imidazole, 0.1 mM ZnSO4), and lysed by sonication. Cellu-
lar debris was removed by centrifugation, and to the supernatant
was added 1/10 volume of 1% polyethyleneimine (pH 8) to precip-
itate the nucleic acids. Following centrifugation, the supernatant
was bound to a charged 10 mL nickel-afﬁnity column and eluted
with buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM
imidazole, 0.1 mM ZnSO4). For TEV protease digestion, frac-
tions containing the fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed at
25˚C overnight in buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM ZnSO4) with 0.16 mg recombinant TEV pro-
tease (Geisbrecht et al., 2006) per 10 mL of fusion protein. The
TEV digestion mixture was dialyzed back into the nickel column
binding buffer and passed again through a charged 10 mL nickel
resin. The His-tagged GB1 protein was retained on the column
while hantavirus Gn tail constructs were present in the ﬂow-
through. The ﬂow-through fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and key fractions pooled and concentrated using Ultra-15 cen-
trifugal ﬁlters (Amicon) and dialyzed into NMR buffer (20 mM
NaPO4 pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ZnSO4). Both
proteins retained two residues (Gly–His) cloning artifacts at the
N-terminus.

Notably, approximately half of the expressed Andes virus Gn
534–610 remained in the insoluble portion upon lysis. This frac-
tion was solubilized in 6 M urea and 10 mM DTT, then refolded
by step-wise dialysis to remove the denaturant and digested with
TEV protease as described above. While the 1H–15N HSQC
spectrum of the refolded protein showed a similar peak pat-
tern for the core zinc ﬁnger domain (residues 543–599), several
of the additional peaks corresponding to the binding sites had

point, and a 5-s recycle delay. Error bars were estimated using the
SD of the background signal of each spectrum.

CD SPECTROSCOPY
CD spectra were collected in triplicate at 25˚ on a JASCO J-815
Spectropolarimeter using a scanning speed of 50 nm/min. Protein
concentrations were kept at 5 μM in buffer (10 μM NaPO4, 10 μM
NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnSO4). EDTA and ZnSO4 titrations were applied
to the same sample.

PHV ZF STRUCTURAL MODELING
Modeling of the structure of PHV Gn 548–602 was achieved by
using the Andes dual zinc ﬁnger domain (PDB ID: 2K9H) as a
template for the I-TASSER structure prediction software (Zhang,
2008). The model backbone was aligned with the backbone of the
Andes virus Gn zinc ﬁnger structure using TM-Align (Zhang and
Skolnick, 2005). Surface electrostatics were calculated using APBS
(Baker et al., 2001) and visualized using Pymol (DeLano, 2002).

RESULTS
PROTEIN EXPRESSION
The PHV Gn tail construct was designed similarly to the previously
published structure of the Andes virus core zinc ﬁnger domain
(Estrada et al., 2009a), yielding a construct of residues 548–602.
The Andes virus Gn tail construct used in this study include as
much of the reported binding sites as possible, yielding a pro-
tein containing residues 534–610. Both proteins expressed well in
E. coli as N-terminal GB1 fusion recombinant proteins and were
puriﬁed under native conditions via ion exchange chromatogra-
phy. Our attempts to express longer full-length Gn tail in Andes
virus and other hantaviruses have been unsuccessful. However, the
Andes virus Gn tail construct used for this study (76 residues) does
represent the longest piece of the hantavirus Gn tail that is struc-
turally characterized at atomic resolution. Incidentally, expression
of the Andes virus Gn 548–602 construct yielded approximately
half of the protein in inclusion bodies. Upon removal of the GB1
tag via cleavage by treatment with TEV protease, the Andes virus
Gn 548–602 protein that was puriﬁed from the inclusion body and
the natively puriﬁed fraction gave well resolved and well-dispersed
1H–15N HSQC spectra (Figure 3).
PHV GN TAIL RELIES ON ZN2+ FOR PROPER REFOLDING
As expected, treatment of the 15N labeled PHV Gn 548–602 NMR
sample with excess EDTA resulted in a near complete collapse of
the 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum (Figure 4A), suggesting a loss of
tertiary structure. Similarly, the CD trace of the PHV Gn 548–602
was also affected by the presence of EDTA (Figure 4B). The addi-
tion of Zn2+
back into the sample was only partially able to recover
the original helical trace. This behavior of the PHV domain resem-
bled that of the Andes protein (Estrada et al., 2009a), suggesting
the conﬁrmed cysteines and histidines in Gn tails were required
for metal coordination.

different chemical shifts compared to the natively expressed pro-
tein (Figure 2). Therefore, the 3D NMR data used for analysis
was collected exclusively on the natively expressed Andes virus Gn
534–610.

NMR SPECTROSCOPY
NMR data were acquired at 25˚C using a Bruker Avance 800 MHz
spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, processed with NMR-
Pipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), and analyzed with NMRView (John-
son, 2004). Backbone assignments for PHV Gn 548–602 were
obtained from 2D 1H–15N HSQC (Grzesiek and Bax, 1993), 3D
HNCA (Grzesiek et al., 1992), and HNCACB (Wittekind and
Mueller, 1993) while assignments for Andes virus Gn 534–610
were obtained from the 2D 1H–15N HSQC and 3D HNCA alone.
Secondary structures were identiﬁed from the Cα chemical shifts
(Wishart and Nip, 1998). The heteronuclear {1H}–15N NOE for
Andes virus Gn 534–610 was acquired as described (Stone et al.,
1992) with 2048 (1H)× 128 (15N) complex points, 32 scans per

(534–610) that has been refolded from insoluble inclusion bodies (red)
and that was natively expressed in the soluble fraction (black). Notably,
the chemical shift values for the ﬂanking sequences are different for each
spectra, indication two conformations for these sequences.

Andes virus Gn 534–610 spectrum is that it differed from the
spectrum of protein refolded from inclusion bodies. An over-
lay of the 1H–15N HSQC spectra of the refolded and natively
expressed Andes virus Gn 534–610 conﬁrmed that the majority
of peaks are in identical positions and that the core zinc ﬁnger
domain (residues 543–599; Estrada et al., 2009a) was properly
folded (Figure 3). However, all subsequent data and assignments
were conducted on the natively Andes virus Gn 534–610 expressed
protein. Nearly complete backbone assignments were obtained
from 2D and 3D NMR datasets for PHV Gn 548–620 and Andes
virus Gn 534–610. Analysis of the Cα secondary chemical shifts for
the PHV protein indicated the presence of two short α-helices and
two random coil regions ﬂanking the central domain (Figure 5A;
Wishart and Nip, 1998). This pattern closely resembles that of the
Andes virus Gn zinc ﬁnger domain (Figure 5A). Given the high
degree of secondary structural similarity between the zinc binding
domains in both structures (77% similarity) and the remarkable
similarity of the Cα secondary chemical shift proﬁle, full side chain
assignments and structure determination of PHV Gn 548–620 was
not continued.

SECONDARY CHEMICAL SHIFT PROFILE OF THE RNP BINDING SITES
Based on the HNCA-derived assignments of the Andes virus Gn
534–610 backbone, we constructed the secondary Cα chemical
shift proﬁle of both the core zinc ﬁnger domain (residues 543–599)
along with the ﬂanking sequences (Figure 5B). Notably, analysis
of the proﬁle suggested the N-terminal sequence (Lys534–Met543)
was disordered. However, the C-terminus contained an intact helix
between residues Arg599 and Lys606. Another interesting feature
was that the intervening sequence corresponding to the core zinc
ﬁnger domain appeared largely unchanged from that of the pro-
tein without the ﬂanking sequences, indicating that the presence
of the binding sites reported by Hepojoki et al. (2010c) did not

affect the local environment and had minimal contact with the
core zinc ﬁnger domain.

BACKBONE DYNAMICS OF THE RNP BINDING SITES
Heteronuclear {1H}–15N NOE analysis of Andes virus Gn 534–
610, which provides a probe on protein backbone dynamics,
suggests that the core zinc ﬁnger domain is largely a rigid struc-
ture (Figure 6A). However, the ﬂanking sequences are consider-
ably more ﬂexible. The disordered N-terminus is almost entirely
ﬂexible relative to the core structure as evident by the heteronu-
clear {1H}–15N NOE values below 0.2 in this region (Figure 6A).
Notably, gradually increasing ﬂexibility at the C-terminus corre-
sponds to the tapering of helix α3, with greatest ﬂexibility at the
disordered ﬁve terminal residues. Backbone R1 and R2 relaxation
results also indicate that the ﬂanking sequences undergo motion
on a faster time scale than the core zinc ﬁnger, with ZF1 and ZF2
both reﬂecting R1 values of approximately 2.0, while the ﬂanking
sequences having R1 values of approximately 4.0 (Figure 6B).

MODELING THE PHV GN ZINC FINGER STRUCTURE
The similarity between the secondary chemical shift proﬁles of the
PHV and the Andes virus zinc binding domains suggest the two

proteins have similar folds. Therefore, the structure of the Andes
virus core zinc ﬁnger domain (residues 543–599, PDB ID 2K9H;
Estrada et al., 2009a) was used as a template for the structural
modeling of the PHV structure. The program I-TASSER (Zhang,
2008) was used to thread the PHV sequence onto the structure.
The resulting structure is shown in Figure 7A. It closely resem-
bles that of the Andes structure, with a backbone rmsd of 0.68
between the two (Figure 7B). Notably, the surface electrostatics of
the PHV model closely resemble those of the Andes virus struc-
ture (Figures 7C,D) in that neither exhibit extensive clustering of
charges.

DISCUSSION
Studies into the virulence of hantaviruses reveal several notable
differences in cells infected by pathogenic and non-pathogenic
hantaviruses. For example, while the non-pathogenic PHV still
manages to infect endothelial cells, the virus apparently does
not successfully replicate in humans (Mackow and Gavrilovskaya,
2009). This suggests PHV does not manage to evade the host
immunogenic response. This notion is supported by evidence that
early infection by PHV causes the induction of up to 24 early inter-
feron genes, as opposed to only three by the pathogenic New York

binding site undergoes motions at least twice as fast as the rigid core zinc

and Hantaan viruses (Geimonen et al., 2002; Spiropoulou et al.,
2007).

Recent studies have begun to map virulence in hantaviruses
to the Gn cytoplasmic tail (Geimonen et al., 2003a,b; Alff et al.,
2006, 2008). In light of these ﬁndings, our structural studies were
conducted on the predicted Gn tail zinc ﬁnger domain of the non-
pathogenic PHV for the purpose of comparing the structure to
that of the pathogenic Andes virus (Figure 1). Additionally, due
to the recent report of the presence of Gn tail–RNP binding sites
located proximal and on either side of the zinc ﬁnger domain of
the Andes virus, the Andes protein used in this study represents a
larger construct design to contain as much of the reported binding
sites as possible. Due to the toxicity of the full-length Gn tail in
bacteria, this latter construct (76 residues) represents the largest
soluble segment of the Gn tail that we have been able to produce.

Gn 534–610 also showed well-dispersed and resolvable peaks
(Figure 2). The high quality of the NMR data facilitated assign-
ment of the backbone resonances, yielding the Cα chemical shift
proﬁle for both proteins. The proﬁle of the PHV zinc ﬁnger
domain is compared to that of the Andes virus in Figure 5. Given
the high degree of sequence conservation, as well as conservation in
the spacing of the dual CCHC motif (Figure 1), it is not surprising
to ﬁnd that the proﬁles of the core domain are remarkably similar.
The only notable differences occur in the ﬁrst and ﬁnal coordinat-
ing cysteines (Cys551 and Cys597, respectively). These differences
may be due to the presence of two non-conserved residues, Glu552
and Lys598, immediately following each cysteine.

One interesting feature of the PHV Gn amino acid sequence
is the presence of a proline (Pro572) in the linker. The proline is
somewhat conserved; it is present in Tula and Hantaan viruses but
absent in the Andes virus, which has an isoleucine in the same
position. Interestingly, a residue with a rigid peptide bond in this
position has little effect on the Cα secondary chemical shift of
Cys571. The secondary chemical shift proﬁle for this part of the
ZF1 array is virtually identical to that of the ZF1 array in the Andes
virus structure (Figure 5), suggesting the tight turn between the
β hairpin and helix of ZF1 is maintained despite the difference
in residues in this region. This observation was an early indicator
that the dual zinc ﬁnger fold is preserved despite large differences
in chemical composition (Figure 1).

Due to the apparent similarity of the structures, we did not
solve the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the PHV zinc ﬁnger
domain. However, a model using I-TASSER (Zhang, 2008) and the
Andes structure as a template was constructed to check the surface
electrostatics of the protein which could then inﬂuence the mol-
ecular interactions of this protein. The modeled PHV zinc ﬁnger
domain contains two similar short α-helices in a relative orien-
tation as seen in the Andes structure (Figure 7). Previously, we
have reported that the core zinc ﬁnger domain of a related Bun-
yavirus, the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, contains a
vastly different arrangement of basic charged residues on its sur-
face when compared to the Andes virus structure (Estrada and De
Guzman, 2011). With respect to the PHV model, we ﬁnd that the
surface electrostatics resemblance those of the Andes virus struc-
ture, with dispersed charges covering the zinc ﬁngers. Only two
non-conserved basic charges, K566 and K592, are present which are
not on the Andes virus structure. Despite these, the PHV structure
is also acidic, with a theoretical isoelectric point of approximately
6.0, thus suggesting that differences in electrostatics of the core
zinc ﬁnger domain are not likely to play a role in pathogenicity.

Overall, the PHV Gn zinc ﬁnger domain appears to adopt the
same dual zinc ﬁnger fold to that of the pathogenic Andes virus.
There were no obvious differences in either the secondary chemi-
cal shift proﬁle or the predicted surface electrostatics. Based on this
data we conclude that, given the widespread nature of the dual zinc
ﬁnger fold in hantaviruses, its role is likely general in nature and
apparently does not play a role in the determination of virulence.
These conclusions are consistent with studies mapping virulence
to the C-terminus of the Gn tails (Sen et al., 2007; Spiropoulou
et al., 2007).

With respect to the role of the Gn tail in virus assembly, the
amino acid sequences ﬂanking the hantavirus zinc ﬁnger domain

Andes virus zinc ﬁnger structure. The PHV model (cyan) matched the
Andes structure (green) with a backbone rmsd of 0.68 for all Cα’s. The PHV
model was constructed using I-TASSER (Zhang, 2008) using the Andes
structure as a template. Structural alignment was carried out using
I-TASSER TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). Surface electrostatic
comparison between the (C) PHV model (residues 548–602) and (D) the
Andes virus zinc ﬁnger domain (residues 534–599). Despite the presence of
two charges (K566 and K592), the net distribution of charges in the PHV
model is not appreciably different from that of the pathogenic.

With respect to the PHV zinc ﬁnger domain, the CD data and
the spectrum of the protein in the presence of chelator (Figure 4A)
conﬁrmed the presence of a metal binding domain. Speciﬁcally,
the fact that titration of zinc sulfate back into the CD sample
(Figure 4B) partially recovers the original spectrum indicates
the domain binds zinc. These results compare favorably with the
behavior of the core zinc ﬁnger domain in the Andes virus (Estrada
et al., 2009a).

The 2D 1H–15N HSQC of the PHV Gn tail consisting of
residues 548–602 showed a well-dispersed spectrum (Figure 4A),
suggesting a monomeric and independently folded protein. Like-
wise, the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the extended Andes virus

have been shown to be important for Gn–N protein interaction
(Hepojoki et al., 2010b). Speciﬁcally, short peptides representing
these regions of the Gn tail disrupted the Gn–N protein interaction
as detected using a SPOT peptide array (Hepojoki et al., 2010b).
Generation of the extended zinc ﬁnger domain (534–610) in the
Andes virus allowed us to characterize one full RNP binding site
(Lys595–Lys610) and a portion of a second (Lys534 and Lys536).

The reported Binding site 2 (Hepojoki et al., 2010c) contains
the short helix α3 located near the carboxyl terminus. Helix α3
contains three conserved basic residues. Arg599 is located at the
beginning turn of the helix, while the lysine pair located at posi-
tions 605 and 606 approximate the end of the helix. A helical
wheel projection suggests that Arg599 and Lys606 are likely ori-
ented in the same direction and may form a conserved basic
patch. Notably, the surface opposite these charges contains the
two conserved hydrophobic residues Phe600 and Leu604, suggest-
ing the helix is amphipathic. Despite this, the helix does not
appear to form part of the independently folded core zinc ﬁnger
domain.

Signiﬁcantly, half of the protein expressed for this larger
segment was insoluble. The solubilized and refolded fraction
appeared to have a normal core zinc ﬁnger fold, as measured by
an overlay of the previously published spectrum and that of the
refolded Andes virus Gn (534–610). However, comparison of the
spectrum of the refolded protein with that of the native protein
revealed two distinct set of chemical shift values for the ﬂanking
sequences, thus indicating two separate conformations (Figure 3).
While this was likely an artifact of refolding, it suggested the arms
can be arranged independent of the core zinc ﬁnger structure.
This notion is supported by the heteronuclear {1H}–15N NOE plot
(Figure 6A), which suggests that much of the ﬂanking sequence is
either somewhat or fully ﬂexible.

The presence of a Gn tetramer in the hantavirus spike com-
plex suggests that four Gn cytoplasmic tails may participate in

binding the RNP (Hepojoki et al., 2010a). Meanwhile, the RNP
itself consists primarily of an N-protein trimer complexed with
RNA (Alfadhli et al., 2001; Kaukinen et al., 2004; Mir and Pangani-
ban, 2004) thus making the Gn–N protein binding site a crowded
space where the important intra-molecular contacts may be com-
plex and multivalent. Our NMR results indicate that the Gn tail
consists of a structured core zinc ﬁnger domain that is ﬂanked
by ﬂexible regions where the reported N-protein binding sites are
located (Hepojoki et al., 2010c). The ﬂexibility in Binding site 2
and part of Binding site 1 as described here may contribute to
modularity of the Gn tail in binding at multiple sites. Thus, our
NMR results, together with the results of others (Hepojoki et al.,
2010c; Wang et al., 2010) suggest that backbone ﬂexibility may be
important in the molecular recognition of the Gn tail.

In summary, the work presented here strongly indicates that the
conserved dual CCHC motif of hantavirus Gn cytoplasmic tails
correlates to a structurally conserved dual zinc ﬁnger domain that
likely represents the only structured region of the tail. The wide-
spread nature of this domain within Bunyaviridae and the high
degree of structural conservation both suggest an important role
in viral assembly, possibly by helping to mediate inter-molecular
contacts with the RNP. The RNP binding sites characterized here
were shown to be ﬂexible and move independently of the core
Andes domain, thus suggesting some degree of modularity in the
function of the Gn tail.
