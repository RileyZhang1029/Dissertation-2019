Bacteriophages can cause great economic losses due to fermentation failure in dairy plants.
Hence, physical and chemical treatments of raw material and/or equipment are mandatory
to maintain phage levels as low as possible. Regarding thermal treatments used to kill path-
ogenic bacteria or achieve longer shelf-life of dairy products, neither low temperature long
time nor high temperature short time pasteurization were able to inactivate most lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) phages. Even though most phages did not survive 90˚C for 2 min, there were
some that resisted 90˚C for more than 15 min (conditions suggested by the International
Dairy Federation, for complete phage destruction). Among biocides tested, ethanol showed
variable effectiveness in phage inactivation, since only phages infecting dairy cocci and Lac-
tobacillus helveticus were reasonably inactivated by this alcohol, whereas isopropanol was
in all cases highly ineffective. In turn, peracetic acid has consistently proved to be very fast
and efﬁcient to inactivate dairy phages, whereas efﬁciency of sodium hypochlorite was
variable, even among different phages infecting the same LAB species. Both alkaline chlo-
ride foam and ethoxylated non-ylphenol with phosphoric acid were remarkably efﬁcient,
trait probably related to their highly alkaline or acidic pH values in solution, respectively.
Photocatalysis using UV light and TiO2 has been recently reported as a feasible option to
industrially inactivate phages infecting diverse LAB species. Processes involving high pres-
sure were barely used for phage inactivation, but until now most studied phages revealed
high resistance to these treatments. To conclude, and given the great phage diversity
found on dairies, it is always advisable to combine different anti-phage treatments (bio-
cides, heat, high pressure, photocatalysis), rather than using them separately at extreme
conditions.

THE THREAT OF PHAGE INFECTIONS IN DAIRY INDUSTRY
Phage infection is the most prevalent cause of decreased starter
activity in cheese and fermented milks manufacturing, resulting
in fermentations in which acid production is markedly reduced
or, in extreme cases, blocked (Neve, 1996). Raw milk is consid-
ered to be the principal source of phages, either as free virions or
as prophages present in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB)
and constitutes the primary phage entranceway to the industrial
environment (Everson, 1991; Josephsen and Neve, 1998). Phages
are difﬁcult to eliminate because they rapidly disseminate in dairy
plants (Neve et al., 1989). As phage infections lead to economic
losses in dairy factories, the development of control measures
becomes essential.

This review is aimed to revise the information regarding the
diverse treatments applied in dairy industry for sanitization and
microbial inactivation, and their efﬁciency on the inactivation of
bacteriophages present in the dairy environment.

TRADITIONAL TREATMENTS I: HEAT TREATMENTS
In dairy manufactures, raw milk is often subjected to a thermal
treatment to eliminate the majority of microorganisms present,
including spoilage and pathogens, thus assuring a good quality

and longer shelf-life of the ﬁnal product. Many works have studied
thermal resistance of lactic acid bacteriophages, especially focusing
on temperatures traditionally used to sanitize the milk in the dairy
industry (63, 72, and 90˚C), and on conditions recommended by
the International Dairy Federation (IDF; 90˚C for 15 min) to guar-
antee complete phage inactivation (Svensson and Christiansson,
1991). For cheese production, low temperature long time (LTLT,
63˚C for 30 min) or high temperature short time (HTST, 72˚C
for 15 s) pasteurization were traditionally applied. Ultra-high-
temperature (UHT) processing, also called ultra-pasteurization
(more than 135˚C for 1–2 s), is a sterilization treatment as it pro-
duces spores destruction. However, this high heating can cause
Maillard browning and negatively affect the taste and smell of
dairy products. Milk used for yogurt production is generally
treated at 80˚C for 30 min or at 95˚C for 10 min (Soukoulis et al.,
2007). Regardless of the high efﬁciency of this heat treatment to
inactivate microorganisms, it is not always effective against dairy
bacteriophages.

Thermal treatments produce morphological changes on phage
particles. The effects of such treatments were monitored by trans-
mission electron microscopy on a heat-sensitive and on a heat-
resistant Lactococcus lactis phage by Atamer et al. (2010). Release

Inactivation treatments for dairy bacteriophages

of phage DNA from viral capsids, decomposition of phage into
head and tail structures, and aggregation of phage tails were the
most frequently seen phenomena, principally for the heat-sensitive
phage studied. For the heat-resistant one, changes in phage mor-
phology were less evident. These authors concluded that heat
resistance is associated with both increased stability of viral DNA
packaged in the capsids and enhanced stability of phage particles
as a whole.

Certain parameters are calculated in order to evaluate phage
susceptibility against heat treatments. One of the most used is
T 99, deﬁned as the time to achieve 99% inactivation of phage par-
ticles, which allows having a very good approximation of phage
resistance against inactivation treatments. However, this parame-
ter does not consider total phage destruction, but inactivation of
the most sensitive 99% of phage population. Whether a heat treat-
ment is applied to samples containing elevated initial phage loads,
remaining viral particles can multiply and reach problematic levels
again. With this regard, the minimum time necessary for complete
phage inactivation (considering it when phage counts become
undetectable in the treated samples) becomes another useful para-
meter. This time may be much longer than the corresponding T 99
and, ideally, both parameters should be determined.

Table 1 overviewed the susceptibility to 63, 72, and 90˚C treat-
ments (expressed as T 99 values) of some bacteriophages from
lactic acid/probiotic bacteria of great importance in fermenta-
tive dairy industry. Regardless the thermal treatment applied, a
great diversity in heat susceptibility has been observed. Conse-
quently, thermal resistance would depend more on the particular
phage studied than on the species speciﬁcity. For instance, some
bacteriophages speciﬁc of L. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus

were rapidly inactivated at 63˚C (T 99 values from 2.7 to 12 min),
whereas some other phages infecting these species revealed high
resistance to the same or even harsher treatments (Binetti and
Reinheimer, 2000; Suárez and Reinheimer, 2002). Low thermal
resistance is not conﬁned to phages infecting dairy cocci (L. lac-
tis and S. thermophilus); a variety of Lactobacillus phages with an
extremely heat sensitivity was also discovered. Among the latter,
it is worth noticing phages hv (Lactobacillus helveticus), Cb1/204
(Lactobacillus delbrueckii), PL-1 and J-1 (Lactobacillus casei and
Lactobacillus paracasei), which showed very low T 99 values (from
2.1 to 3.1 min) in all suspension media tested (Quiberoni et al.,
1999; Capra et al., 2004; Ebrecht et al., 2010). In spite of the high
heat sensitivity to 63˚C shown by some Lactobacillus phages, there
were others capable to easily resist this treatment, as demonstrated
by Lactobacillus plantarum phages investigated by Briggiler Marcó
et al. (2009) (T 99 values > 45 min).

As it can be deduced, increasing the temperature from 63 to
72˚C improved the efﬁciency of phage inactivation. Still, numer-
ous phages tested were able to resist this higher temperature.
Good examples are phages 001 (L. lactis), 0BJ and CYM (S.
thermophilus), CNRZ 832-B1 (Lb. helveticus), Ib3 (Lb. delbrueckii
subsp. lactis), ATCC 8014-B2 and FAGK1 (Lb. plantarum), show-
ing high T 99 values after incubation at 72˚C. Sometimes, even
if T 99 values were not so elevated (e.g., 2.5 min for phage Ib3),
the time to destroy the total viral population was much longer
(>45 min). In these cases, inactivation curves might be ﬁtted
into two or even three independent linear components (Daoust
et al., 1965). Attempts to explain this behavior suggested that a
mixture of phage particles with different heat sensitivity might
exist: a rapidly inactivated population, responsible for the low T 99

values obtained, and a heat-resistant one, explaining the long time
required for total phage inactivation. Both populations would fol-
low a ﬁrst-order reaction, but with a decreased slope for the latter
(Hiatt, 1964). It has been suggested that heat-resistant phages nat-
urally occur in all types of dairy environments as a low proportion
of the whole phage population (Atamer et al., 2009). This fact
remarks the importance of consider both parameters when deﬁn-
ing the heat sensitivity of a given phage. Similarly to phage Ib3,
destruction of total viral populations for the above mentioned
heat-resistant phages was generally not achieved at this temper-
ature, since detectable viable phage particles were found even
after 45 min of treatment, which is a much longer period than
that normally applied in the dairy industry for milk sanitization
(Quiberoni et al., 1999, 2003; Binetti and Reinheimer, 2000; Suárez
and Reinheimer, 2002; Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009). Dissimilar
susceptibility to short-time pasteurization conditions (72˚C for
30 s) was found for two Lactococcus phages; whereas one of them
was complete and rapidly inactivated (loss of 7 log orders), the
other one was highly heat-resistant (reduction of 2 log orders) and
remained viable even after 60 min of treatment (Müller-Merbach
et al., 2005). Figure 1 shows thermal inactivation kinetics at 72˚C of
some dairy bacteriophages, when reconstituted skim milk (RSM)
was used as suspension media.

In most cases, temperatures higher than 72–75˚C allowed efﬁ-
cient phage inactivation in a short time. Since milk destined to
yogurt manufacture is usually treated at 82˚C for 5 min, some
authors have subjected Lb. delbrueckii phage particles to this tem-
perature (Ebrecht et al., 2010), ﬁnding total phage destruction
within 2 min of treatment. Similarly, Müller-Merbach et al. (2005)
treated lactococcal phages P001 and P008 to 80˚C, demonstrating

undetectable counts after only 1 min at this temperature. On
the contrary, 40% of L. lactis phages tested were able to resist
80˚C for 5 min (Atamer et al., 2009), whereas 70% of Leuconos-
toc phages particles were still detectable after 1 min at this tem-
perature (Atamer et al., 2011). Until recently, heat treatment
at 90˚C for 5 min was sufﬁcient for inactivation of phage par-
ticles (Binetti and Reinheimer, 2000; Suárez and Reinheimer,
2002; Capra et al., 2004; Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009). Despite
this, in the last years some extraordinarily heat-resistant phages
are being found in many research laboratories, such as phage
Ib3 (Lb. delbrueckii), whose complete inactivation required at
least 15 min at 90˚C (Quiberoni et al., 2003). In the same way,
30 min were necessary to destroy ﬁve Lb. paracasei phages at
that temperature (Capra et al., 2009a). Moreover, some lacto-
coccal phages were able to survive 5 min at 90˚C (Buzrul et al.,
2007), whereas Atamer et al. (2009) revealed that phage P1532
was still detectable even after heating at either 90˚C for 20 min
or 97˚C for 5 min. The protocol used for microbiological detec-
tion of phages in dairy samples includes a heat treatment at
90˚C for 15 min of control samples to be tested for non-phage
inhibiting agents (Svensson and Christiansson, 1991). However,
this standard protocol might not be appropriate for inactivat-
ing high heat-resistant phages (Atamer et al., 2009). Further-
more, the number of phages with exceptional thermo-resistance
seems to be increasing every day, which led to the need of revis-
ing the methodology applied to industrial samples suspected of
containing phages.

Thermal susceptibility of phages can differ according to the
suspension media used. However, dissimilar results impeded an
agreement about the most protective one. In some cases, milk

seemed to be protective to viral particles, as observed for those
of Lb. delbrueckii tested by Quiberoni et al. (2003), in compar-
ison to MRS broth and TMG buffer. Similar conclusions were
obtained by other authors when testing either Lactococcus or Leu-
conostoc phages (Atamer et al., 2009, 2010, 2011). The reason
for the protective effect of milk is still being investigated; how-
ever, it was postulated that certain components, especially casein,
could be responsible for the increased thermal resistance of dairy
phages. Unlike protein, fat was found to have no inﬂuence on
phage inactivation (Atamer et al., 2010). Protective effect of milk,
however, was not always veriﬁed. For example, Suárez and Rein-
heimer (2002) determined that phosphate buffer was the most
protective medium in comparison with M17-broth and skim milk.
Sometimes, it was not possible to establish a clear inﬂuence of
the suspension media. Some Lb. helveticus phages, for example,
resisted better in MRS broth, but others did it in TMG buffer
(Quiberoni et al., 1999). Likewise, not conclusive inﬂuence was
found by Capra et al. (2004) when analyzing Lb. casei and Lb.
paracasei phages.

TRADITIONAL TREATMENTS II: BIOCIDES
A biocide should fulﬁll several criteria to be usable in the food
industry, for example possessing a fast antimicrobial activity, ease
of application, low cost, lack of negative impact on the ﬁnal prod-
uct, and degradation into harmless ﬁnal products (Nicholds and
Wolf, 1945; Schröder, 1984). However, inactivation of bacterio-
phages was taken into consideration only recently as a criterion
of biocides selection, which is reﬂected by an increasing number
of studies directed to quantify their effectiveness in this sense.
Many of these works were carried out in our laboratory and bio-
cides tested were, until recently, almost exclusively ethyl alcohol
(ethanol), isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol), sodium hypochlorite,
and peracetic acid, all of which will be further discussed. Table 2
summarizes sensitivity (expressed as T 99) of phages of diverse bac-
terial species to ethanol and sodium hypochlorite used at different
concentration.

Ethanol and, at much lesser extent, isopropanol, were tested
on a broad spectrum of LAB phages, at concentrations oscillat-
ing between 10 and 100% (v/v), but the lower concentration did

Inactivation treatments for dairy bacteriophages

not produce in general any visible effect. Thus, only 50% (v/v)
or higher concentrations will be considered for discussion from
now on. With respect to isopropanol, it was tested on phages of
L. lactis (Suárez and Reinheimer, 2002), S. thermophilus (Binetti
and Reinheimer, 2000), Lb. delbrueckii (Quiberoni et al., 2003;
Ebrecht et al., 2010), Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei (Capra et al.,
2004, 2006), and Lb. plantarum (Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009).
In all cases, inactivation was almost undetectable and required
very long incubation periods (generally >45 min), with only a few
exceptions (lactococcal phage 001, Lb. delbrueckii phage LL-H, and
S. thermophilus phage 031-D) where a milder effect was observed.
Consequently, the biocide efﬁciency of isopropanol will not be
subsequently debated.

Streptococcus thermophilus phages CYM, 021-4, 021-5, 0BJ, and
031-D showed a moderate sensitivity to ethanol, as viral counts
were 99% reduced (T 99) after less than 5 min of incubation in 75%
(v/v) ethanol (optimal concentration), and became undetectable
after 15 min of contact with either 75 or 100% (v/v) concentra-
tions. An exception was phage 021-4, which greatly resisted 100%
(v/v; >45 min; Table 2), although being highly sensitive to 75%
(v/v) ethanol (Binetti and Reinheimer, 2000). Lactococcal phages
were, instead, more affected by pure ethanol than by 50 or 75%
(v/v) dilutions, with the exception of phage QP4, which possesses a
very low resistance to 75% (v/v) ethanol. As a group, Lb. helveticus
phages were the most sensitive to ethanol treatments of all studied
LAB phages. Collection phages CNRZ 832-B1 and CNRZ 0241
were inactivated by 50% (v/v) ethanol after 5 min of incubation.
Curiously, the former was moderately affected by a concentration
of as low as 10% (v/v) ethanol, being the only phage with a reported
T 99 lower than 45 min for such concentration (Table 2). Phages
hv and ATCC 15807-B1, instead, were more sensitive to a higher
concentration (75% v/v) (Quiberoni et al., 1999). Lb. delbrueckii
phages, either of virulent (Quiberoni et al., 2003) or temperate
(Ebrecht et al., 2010) nature, were most sensitive to 100% (v/v)
ethanol, and showed dissimilar T 99 values at this concentration,
ranging from 22.2 min for phage Ib3 (the most resistant) to 2 min
or less for phages YAB and temperate phage Cb1/204 (Table 2). In
turn, LL-H was the only Lb. delbrueckii phage completely inacti-
vated after 30 min in 75% (v/v) ethanol (Quiberoni et al., 2003).
Interestingly, temperate phages Cb1/204 and Cb1/342 presented
lower T 99 values than 3 out of the 4 virulent phages studied
(Table 2). Concerning either virulent phages PL-1, J-1 (Capra et al.,
2004), and MLC-A (Capra et al., 2006), or temperate phages iLp84
and iLp1308 (Mercanti et al., 2012), all infective for Lb. casei and
Lb. paracasei, a similar pattern of inactivation was obtained after
incubation with ethanol: a fast initial reduction of about two-log
orders was followed by a plateau, yielding almost the same phage
titers after 15 or 45 min of treatment. For all Lb. casei and Lb. para-
casei phages, best inactivation was achieved at 75% (v/v). Finally,
Lb. plantarum phages were only slightly inactivated with 100%
(v/v; the best concentration) or 50% (v/v) ethanol, and almost
not affected by 75% (v/v), which is optimal for many other LAB
phages (Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009). Apart from this peculiarity,
inactivation rates were similar between Lb. casei or Lb. paracasei
and Lb. plantarum phages.

With respect to the mechanism of action of ethanol, a study
conducted by Maillard et al. (1996a) showed capsid alterations on

F116, a phage infective for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; as expected,
no DNA damage was evidenced. The antibacterial attribute of
alcohols is mainly due to alterations on the lipid fraction of the
plasmatic membrane. For this reason, naked phages are likely to
be naturally more resistant than bacteria to ethanol challenging.

To sum up, it can be concluded that there are three levels
of phage sensitivity to ethanol. In general, the most suscepti-
ble (though moderately) phages were those infecting dairy cocci:
L. lactis and S. thermophilus. Among lactobacilli, Lb. helveticus
were readily inactivated as well. In the middle are placed phages
infecting Lb. delbrueckii, with dissimilar resistance showed by dif-
ferent phages. Finally, phages infecting Lb. plantarum, Lb. casei and
Lb. paracasei were highly resistant to ethanol treatments. In gen-
eral, the efﬁciency of phage inactivation accomplished by ethanol,
though superior than that of isopropanol, is still not sufﬁcient for
industrial applications. Besides, the absence of an optimal ethanol
concentration able to kill a broad range of dairy phages makes
this compound unsuitable as an anti-phage strategy in the dairy
industry.

Resistance to sodium hypochlorite of phages infective for
diverse LAB genera resembles that exhibited against ethanol.
Firstly, Lb. helveticus, L. lactis, and S. thermophilus phage parti-
cles were completely eliminated by a concentration of residual
free chlorine as low as 100 ppm (Quiberoni et al., 1999; Binetti
and Reinheimer, 2000; Suárez and Reinheimer, 2002); only L.
lactis phages 046 and QP4 required a stronger inactivation treat-
ment (300 ppm for 45 min and 200 ppm for 30 min, respectively;
Suárez and Reinheimer, 2002). On the other hand, two tem-
perate Lb. delbrueckii phages (Ebrecht et al., 2010) were readily
killed as well. However, likewise for ethanol inactivation, there
were other Lb. delbrueckii phages with a noticeably greater resis-
tance (BYM, YAB, and LL-H), requiring between 5 and 45 min
in the presence of 400 ppm of residual free chlorine (Quiberoni
et al., 2003) for complete inactivation. Special attention deserves
Lb. delbrueckii phage Ib3. Unexpectedly, it exhibited the highest
phage resistance to sodium hypochlorite ever measured, requir-
ing a minimal concentration of 1200 ppm of residual free chlorine
for at least 45 min for complete inactivation; this fact has been
attributed to a long persistence of the phage in industrial envi-
ronments (Quiberoni et al., 2003). As regards of Lb. plantarum
and Lb. casei, Lb. paracasei phages, all exhibited similar resistance
to sodium hypochlorite. For four Lb. plantarum phages, exposures
of 15 min (phage ATCC 8014-B2) and 30 min (phages ATCC 8014-
B1, FAGK1, and FAGK2) to 800 ppm of residual free chlorine were
necessary to completely inactivate phage suspensions (Briggiler
Marcó et al., 2009). Similarly, Capra et al. (2004) reported a mini-
mum incubation of 5 min at 800 ppm of residual free chlorine as
necessary to completely inactivate Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei phage
suspensions, whereas Mercanti et al. (2012) reported dissimilar
results from one temperate Lb. paracasei to another: a concentra-
tion of 400 ppm was able to quickly eliminate iLp1308, but 30 min
at 800 ppm were necessary for complete inactivation of iLp84, even
though a T 99 < 2 min was calculated for the latter (Table 2). As
800 ppm of free chlorine is a concentration perceptively higher
than that permitted in the dairy industry (Briggiler Marcó et al.,
2009), chlorine could be usable only at laboratory scale for the
inactivation of Lb. plantarum, Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei phages.

Inactivation treatments for dairy bacteriophages

According to some studies, sodium hypochlorite would cause
phage inactivation through aggregation of tail proteins (Maillard
et al., 1998), in addition to several structural alterations to the
bacteriophage capsid; which is likely to be related to the release of
phage DNA into the external medium. Overall, sodium hypochlo-
rite could be regarded as a good (but not excellent) choice for
industrial phage inactivation. It was quite effective for most chal-
lenged phages, but there are some of them which resisted biocide
concentrations much greater than those permitted in an industrial
sanitization process.

Peracetic acid (also known as ethaneperoxoic acid or perox-
yacetic acid) is commercially available in the form of a mixture
containing acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and
water in a quaternary equilibrium (Gehr et al., 2003). With regard
to its use in the dairy industry, it has been widely documented as
the best practical agent for phage inactivation. Its major advantages
include its ability to efﬁciently inactivate most microorganisms,
its resistance to catalase and peroxidase (enzymes which break
down hydrogen peroxide) and its degradation into environmen-
tally friendly products (acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide). Per-
acetic acid maintains its activity over a wide temperature (0–40˚C)
and pH (3.0–7.5) ranges and in hard water, and is not affected
by protein residues. These characteristics allow to safely use it in
the food industry and even for cleaning-in-place (CIP) practices.
Concerning the virucidal activity of peracetic acid, there are many
works reporting a fast and effective inactivation of a broad spec-
trum of LAB phages, including phages infecting S. thermophilus
(Binetti and Reinheimer, 2000), L. lactis (Suárez and Reinheimer,
2002), and several species of dairy lactobacilli, including Lb. del-
brueckii (Quiberoni et al., 2003; Ebrecht et al., 2010), Lb. helveticus
(Quiberoni et al., 1999), Lb. plantarum (Briggiler Marcó et al.,
2009), Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei (Capra et al., 2004, 2006; Mer-
canti et al., 2012). In addition, this chemical proved to be effective
for the inactivation of non-LAB phages, such as P. aeruginosa
phage F116 (Maillard et al., 1993). In all cases, a treatment of 5 min
(or 2 min in some cases) at 40˚C was enough to drop phage counts
to undetectable levels, even of phages highly resistant to other
chemical or thermal treatments, such as Lb. delbrueckii phage Ib3
(Ebrecht et al., 2010). Peracetic acid is normally used at a concen-
tration of 0.15% (v/v) in water; the low pH of this aqueous solution
(around 2) has been suggested to be responsible for phage inactiva-
tion (Mercanti et al., 2012). Schröder (1984) proposed 40˚C as the
most effective temperature to inactivate bacteria, yeasts, and fungi
using peracetic acid. However, effectiveness for the inactivation
of Lb. plantarum (Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009), Lb. casei and Lb.
paracasei (Mercanti et al., 2012) phages was found to be similar at
either 25 or 40˚C, thus recommending the use of this temperature
for industrial convenience. Peracetic acid exerts its action through
·
the hydroxyl radical (
OH), which reacts with any oxidizable com-
pound present in its neighborhood, damaging practically any kind
of macromolecule associated with a microorganism and eventu-
ally leading to its death. Complete rupture of the nucleic acid
is accomplished during bacteriophage inactivation, but whether it
occurs inside the capsid or after the DNA is released due to a capsid
structural damage remains unclear. Such alteration of the capsid
structure was observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(Maillard et al., 1996a,b).

There are several new biocides that are being progressively used
by the dairy industry. Among these, it is worth mentioning: (i)
quaternary ammonium chloride, (ii) peracetic and peroctanoic
acids with hydrogen peroxide (Vortexx; Ecolab, 2011), (iii) an alka-
line chloride foam (Active CL), (iv) p-toluenesulfonchloroamide,
sodium salt (Clorina F; Cibsa, 2011), and (v) ethoxylated non-
ylphenol with phosphoric acid. However, very scarce data about
their efﬁciency on LAB phages inactivation are available so far,
with reports only on Lb. delbrueckii (Ebrecht et al., 2010), Lb. casei
and Lb. paracasei (Mercanti et al., 2012) phages. Phage-killing
activity was rather variable among these chemicals. Both alkaline
chloride foam or ethoxylated nonylphenol with phosphoric acid
were exceptionally efﬁcient, which could be attributable to their
extreme pH values (>12 and <2, respectively); phages of species
were not detected after 2 min of treatment (Ebrecht et al., 2010;
Mercanti et al., 2012). Quaternary ammonium chloride proved to
be a usable biocide as well, but its efﬁciency quickly diminished
at concentrations slightly under the optimal recommended, espe-
cially for Lb. delbrueckii phages (Ebrecht et al., 2010). Lb. casei and
Lb. paracasei phages were more sensitive to low concentrations of
quaternary ammonium chloride, but also in this case its effective-
ness differed among the two phages studied (Mercanti et al., 2012).
On the contrary, p-toluensulfonchloroamide showed no reduction
on phage numbers, even when this compound was utilized with-
out dilution and for longer incubation times, up to 2 h on Lb. casei
and Lb. paracasei phages (Mercanti et al., 2012).

In turn, very different inactivation rates were observed between
Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei phages when using
Vortexx. Whereas all the Lb. delbrueckii phages studied were thor-
oughly inactivated by 0.13% (v/v) Vortexx [with the exception
of phage Ib3, which was only inactivated by a concentration of
0.26% (v/v); Ebrecht et al., 2010], this biocide failed to produce
any evident reduction on Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei phage counts
at a concentration of 0.26% (v/v) (Mercanti et al., 2012). Vortexx
is publicized as a novel product with excellent sanitizing results
at room temperature and delivering wide antimicrobial activity,
including yeasts, mold, and bacteria, at much lower concentration
than peracetic acid used alone (Ecolab, 2011). This lower peracetic
acid concentration raises the pH of Vortexx (at the recommended
concentration of use) to values between 3.1 and 3.4. Unfortunately,
this higher pH appears to be critical for the inactivation of some
phages, as both iLp84 and iLp1308 were quick and completely inac-
tivated by 0.15% (v/v) peracetic acid, whilst 0.26% (v/v) Vortexx
yielded no signiﬁcant titer reductions after 20 min of incubation
(Mercanti et al., 2012).

INSIGHTS TO NEW INACTIVATION TREATMENTS
PHOTOCATALYSIS
Raw milk is regarded as one of the main sources of phages, thus
representing their most important way of entry to the industrial
environment (Everson, 1991; Josephsen and Neve, 1998). More-
over, the capability of bacteriophages to remain in the air for long
periods makes bioaerosols one of the most important dispersion
routes of virions. Unfortunately, none of the currently available
technologies is appropriate to inactivate bacteriophages suspended
in the air of dairies, either in laboratory or in processing plants
(Quiberoni et al., 1999, 2004, 2006).

Inactivation treatments for dairy bacteriophages

The photocatalytic properties of TiO2 have been the subject of
much research, mainly for the photochemical pollutant oxidation.
Several advantages of photocatalysis make this methodology an
excellent alternative to the traditional chemical disinfection: (i)
absence of residues, (ii) simultaneous treatment of diverse pol-
lutant mixtures, (iii) broad range, and (iv) ease of operation.
Besides, the low cost, high abundance and safety of TiO2 make
this compound the most frequently selected catalyst (Hoffmann
et al., 1995; Fujishima et al., 2000; de Lasa et al., 2005). Semi-
−
conductor TiO2 generates highly oxidizing species (O
OH)
2 and
when photoexcited by UV radiation, thus catalyzing various chem-
ical reactions, including the decomposition of organic compounds
and destruction of microorganisms (Horie et al., 1996).

·

Photocatalysis application has been mostly intended to destroy
fungi, bacteria, and spores in the air (Kakita et al., 2000; Kashige
et al., 2001; Koziumi and Taya, 2002; Kühn et al., 2003; Cho et al.,
2005; Pal et al., 2007; Ditta et al., 2008; Zacarías et al., 2010)
though its efﬁciency for the inactivation of viruses contained in
bioaerosols has been scarcely explored. Furthermore, only a very
few studies have been focused on the combined application of UV
and TiO2 in order to avoid phage dissemination in the environ-
ment. Sjogren and Sierka (1994) were able to reduce the titer of
a ms2 phage (speciﬁc for Escherichia coli) suspension by a factor
of 10 after 10 min of irradiation at 2 mW/m2 in the presence of
TiO2 in a continuously stirred batch reactor. Regarding phages
infecting LAB, Kakita et al. (2000) have reported the inactivation
of phage PL-1 (L. casei) by using a ceramic preparation coated
with a mixture of oxides including TiO2 and AgO. The experi-
ment was conducted in liquid medium and the suspended phages
were subjected to irradiation with black-light (BL; 300–400 nm)
in the presence of TiO2 thin ﬁlm. These authors demonstrated the
conversion of the virions into inactivated ghost particles, having an
empty head without DNA. Later, Kashige et al. (2001) investigated
the PL-1 phage inactivation mechanism; the authors found that
the genome DNA inside the phage capsids was fragmented, sug-
gesting a previous damage to the capsid protein by active oxygen
species generated in the TiO2 ﬁlm-settled aqueous medium under
BL. The generation of both superoxide anions (O
) and hydroxyl
radicals (
OH) in the aqueous medium was veriﬁed by chemical
analysis, whereas electrophoresis conﬁrmed a considerable phage
genome DNA fragmentation.

More recently, TiO2 photocatalysis was reported as a feasi-
ble methodology for the inactivation of phages infecting several
LAB species, since this technology seemed to be very efﬁcient
to this purpose (Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009, 2011). To our
knowledge, these studies are the ﬁrst ones referring photocatal-
ysis (UV radiation and TiO2) applied to phages in bioaerosols.
The laboratory reactor used by Briggiler Marcó et al. (2009,
2011) consists of an UV-A radiation emitting system (wavelength
range of 300–420 nm, maximum emission at about 350 nm),
an irradiation chamber, and a support to hold the TiO2-coated
borosilicate glass plates (Zacarías et al., 2010). The photocat-
alytic inactivation was applied on phage suspensions (107 plaque
forming units (PFU)/ml) prepared in distilled water. Phage sus-
pensions were taken in the TiO2-coated plates, further covered
with a borosilicate glass to create a thickness similar to bioaerosol

drops, and ﬁnally irradiated in a chamber with UV light for a
maximum period of 3 h. Very dissimilar behaviors were demon-
strated by each bacteriophage under the same photocatalytic
treatment. For instance, undetectable counts (<10 PFU/ml) were
achieved for phage BYM after 45 min of exposure, but 60 min
were necessary to attain similar results (<50 PFU/ml) for phages
ATCC 8014-B1 and ATCC 8014-B2. Likewise, undetectable counts
(<10 PFU/ml) of phages J-1 and QF9 particles were reached
after 120 min of exposure. Contrarily, phages ATCC 15807-B1
and Ib3 were able to resist up to 180 min of treatment, exhibit-
ing viability losses of only 1.2 log orders. A similar performance
was demonstrated by phage MLC-A, with a loss of viable parti-
cles of only 2.4 log orders after 120 min of exposure, (Briggiler
Marcó et al., 2009, 2011). Regarding the photocatalytic inactiva-
tion efﬁciency (ηabs), values calculated by the authors differed in
more than two-log orders among all the phages tested (Table 3).
The highest inactivation efﬁciency was experimented by the bac-
−11 PFU/photon),
the phage
−12 PFU/photon). Besides, the authors
observed that related phages,
lytic for the same strain and
morphologically similar, evidenced different behavior under the
same conditions of photocatalytic inactivation. Attempting to
explain these results, a dissimilar stability of viral proteins
against the absorbed radiation energy was postulated. Con-
sidering the capsomers as a protective shield for viral DNA
against the damage caused by the photocatalysis, thus differ-
ent primary and conformational structure of capsid proteins
would be relevant factors affecting the resulting inactivation
kinetics (Briggiler Marcó et al., 2011). Articles focusing on the
photocatalytic inactivation of microorganisms and or viruses
hardly report their efﬁciency in terms of photons absorbed.
In this sense, the only known study concerning TiO2 photo-
catalytic inactivation expressed in terms of photons absorbed
was applied on bacterial cells, speciﬁcally on E. coli suspensions
(Marugán et al., 2008) and the kinetic analysis was reported. An
−11 CFU/photon
apparent photonic efﬁciency in the order of 10
was calculated by the authors for the maximum E. coli dis-
infection rate achieved during the experiments. Comparable
−11 PFU/photon) were
inactivation orders (of approximately 10
obtained by Briggiler Marcó et al. (2009) when analyzing inac-
tivation efﬁciency of dairy bacteriophages, showing Lb. plan-
tarum phage ATCC 8014-B2 the highest inactivation efﬁciency
(Table 3).

Briggiler Marcó et al. (2009, 2011) demonstrated the efﬁciency
of the photocatalysis as a new methodology to be applied in dairies,
where LAB represent the target of bacteriophage attacks. In com-
parison to the UV-C and UV-C/TiO2 units currently available
in the market for the environmental air puriﬁcation (Kover Syn-
ergy, 2010; Novapure, 2010), the UV-A radiation assayed by the
authors has the advantage of safe use, thus allowing their applica-
tion for long periods even in the presence of personnel. Additional
research, particularly focused on the photocatalysis inactivation
mechanism and the method efﬁciency, are indispensable for the
design of equipment to be used in industrial environments, either
in plants or in laboratories.

HIGH-PRESSURE TREATMENTS
Thermal treatments such as pasteurization and sterilization were
traditionally used in food industry for assuring safety and longer
shelf-life of food products. Although they are efﬁcient and eco-
nomical processes to inactivate microorganisms, they can cause
undesirable protein denaturation, non-enzymatic browning, and
loss of vitamins and volatile ﬂavor compounds. Bearing in mind
the idea of avoiding undesirable consequences of heating, in the
last years considerable efforts were focused on the development of
novel non-thermal preservation processes. Among them, high-
pressure processing is one of the most promising, because it
combines maximal retention of the chemical and physicochem-
ical product properties with efﬁcient germ reduction (Lado and
Yousef, 2002; Diels and Michiels, 2006). The most studied and
applied pressure-based processes are high hydrostatic pressure
(HHP) and high-pressure homogenization (HPH). Although the
apparent similarities between both technologies, they have some
relevant differences that should be pointed out. First of all, they
have very dissimilar exposure time; this parameter abruptly dimin-
ishes from a few minutes in HHP to a second or less in HPH
(Wuytack et al., 2002). HPH is a high hydrodynamic process
during which the ﬂuid is forced to pass through a small ori-
ﬁce and then subjected to an ultra-rapid decompression. The
sudden fall in the local pressure of the ﬂuid at constant tem-
perature lead to the nucleation and growth of vapor bubbles (or
cavities) within the body of liquid, the collapse of which could
transmit several localized forces to surfaces or particles, includ-
ing the microbial cell (Middelberg, 1995). On the other hand,
HHP systems consist of a pressure vessel, the pressure transmis-
sion ﬂuid (usually water) and one or more pressurizing pumps.
The packaged food is loaded into the vessel, the top is closed
and the ﬂuid is pumped into the vessel from the bottom. When
the desired pressure is reached, pumping is stopped, valves are
closed and the pressure is maintained without further need for
energy input. The pressure is rapidly and uniformly transmitted

throughout the pressure ﬂuid and the food. The high pressure is
applied isostatically so that all parts of the food are subjected to
the same pressure at exactly the same time. In the case of liquids,
such as fruit juices, the whole vessel can be ﬁlled with the juice,
which becomes itself the pressure transmission ﬂuid (Patterson,
2005).

Homogenization was developed many years ago with the main
purpose of enhancing the texture, taste, ﬂavor, and shelf-life of
food emulsions, particularly dairy products like milk and cream
butter. As the consumers began to claim for more “natural” and
fresh foods with improved stability, safety and extended shelf-life, a
new generation homogenizers was consequently developed, giving
as a result the origin of HPH (Diels and Michiels, 2006). Besides the
food industry, HPH is frequently applied in the pharmaceutical,
cosmetic, and chemical industries for the preparation or stabiliza-
tion of emulsions and suspensions, or to yield viscosity changes
in products (Floury et al., 2004). HPH-treated milk seemed to be
very convenient to improve cheese quality and physicochemical
properties of fermented milks as well (Burns et al., 2008). HPH
could be also applied to cell disruption of yeasts and bacteria,
thus causing a partial inactivation of the microbial population
and allowing the release of intracellular components (Guerzoni
et al., 1999). As a consequence, HPH has been regarded as an
alternative to other processes commonly applied for the inacti-
vation of pathogenic and spoiling microorganisms (heat, steril-
ization, and irradiation) (Diels et al., 2005; Diels and Michiels,
2006).

Viral inactivation by HPH treatments was not profoundly
studied, especially when distinctively speaking of bacteriophages
(Moroni et al., 2002; Diels and Michiels, 2006; Capra et al.,
2009b; D’Souza et al., 2009). As it was previously mentioned,
raw milk is regarded as the main source of phages entering
to the dairies, some of them possessing a remarkable thermal
resistance (Capra et al., 2004; Briggiler Marcó et al., 2009).
HPH could be therefore used as an unconventional treatment

alternative to heat. Nevertheless, only a few reports are avail-
able in the bibliography. By using electron microscopy, Moroni
et al. (2002) observed that HPH-treated lactococcal phages were
possibly inactivated by the loss of genetic material from frag-
mented phage heads. Either total or partial loss of phage tails
was also observed, rendering them incapable of adsorption to
the bacterial cell wall. Results obtained by the authors demon-
strated a statistically signiﬁcant difference in sensitivity to HPH
between the two morphology-types of phages: prolate-headed
(phage c2) and isometric-headed (phages sk1 and ul36), being
the prolate head less stable than the isometric one. More recently,
phages infecting several species of lactic and probiotic bacteria
were also studied. Amongst them, two temperate Lb. paracasei
phages (iLp84 and iLp1308) showed a logarithmic reduction of
viability along with the successive passes at 100 MPa when sus-
pended in RSM (Mercanti et al., 2012). For these phages, falls of
4 and 4.5 log orders were observed, respectively, after ﬁve passes
at 100 MPa (Figure 2). These results were similar to those pre-
viously obtained for phages MLC-A (speciﬁc for Lb. paracasei),
ATCC 8014-B1 (Lb. plantarum), and CNRZ 832-B1 (Lb. helveti-
cus) subjected to the same experimental conditions (Capra et al.,
2009b), observing viability losses of 3.8, 3.75, and 2.0 log orders,
respectively. In turn, phages MLC-A8 (Lb. casei), BYM (Lb. del-
brueckii), ALQ13.2 (S. thermophilus), QP4 and QF12 (L. lactis)
were not detected after only ﬁve passes at 100 MPa through the
high-pressure homogenizer. It is interesting to emphasize that
related phages MLC-A and MLC-A8, lytic for the same probi-
otic Lb. paracasei strain, showed remarkably different behavior
after HPH treatment, being the former more resistant than the

latter. In addition, HPH treatments applied to different initial
concentrations of the same phage rendered dissimilar inactiva-
tion efﬁciency. Contrarily to earlier reported results (Moroni et al.,
2002; Capra et al., 2009b), working speciﬁcally with phage MLC-A,
found that the higher the initial phage load, the greater the reduc-
tion achieved. On the other hand, bacteriophage inactivation rate
showed to be proportional to both applied pressure and number of
passes. Concerning the inﬂuence of suspension media (milk, whey
permeate, buffer), results were very dependent on each phage.
Although some authors (Moroni et al., 2002) reported diminished
HPH effectiveness in milk and whey permeate, no clear protective
effect for any of the assayed media was detected by Capra et al.
(2009b).

Similarly to HPH, HHP has been proposed as an alternative to
the thermal treatments applied in food preservation (Patterson,
2005). Advantages of HHP (preservation of the fresh taste and
nutrient content, among others) in comparison to heat processes
are comparable to those previously presented for HPH. Besides
these advantages, effectiveness of HHP in inactivating different
microbial species has been reported (Ananta and Knorr, 2009).
Regarding bacteriophage inactivation, scarce data are available,
although some authors have documented HHP inactivation of
dairy phages. Speciﬁcally, L. lactis phages P001 and P008, sus-
pended in enriched M17-broth, were treated at up to 600 MPa
(Müller-Merbach et al., 2005). Both phages are commonly found
in German dairy plants, being representative of c2 (prolate head)
and 936 (isometric head) species, respectively. The isometric phage
P008 was considerably more resistant, with a 5 log order reduc-
tion after 2 h at 600 MPa, whereas the same titer reduction was

Guglielmotti et al.

Inactivation treatments for dairy bacteriophages

obtained for prolate phage P001 during the pressure-build-up
time. The greater inactivation observed for the prolate head-phage
led the authors think about a correlation between phage mor-
phology and stability, in agreement with the previous hypothesis
of Moroni et al. (2002). According to the latter authors, the long
form of the prolate head make it less stable than the isometric
structure, thus turning prolate head-phage particle more sensitive
to high-pressure treatments.

CONCLUSION
Phage control measures should be focused on avoiding dissemi-
nation of phages, so as to maintain their titers under critical levels.
Diverse chemical and physical treatments industrially employed
for sanitization showed different rates of efﬁciency on phage inac-
tivation. Considering thermal treatments, either LTLT or HTST
pasteurization conditions would not assure a complete inactiva-
tion of phage particles, especially of those very thermo-resistant,
and even 90˚C were not enough to inactivate some dairy phages.

Among biocides, only peracetic acid remains the only fully reli-
able option for phage destruction, though two new products seem
promising for this purpose. Pioneering technologies on phage
inactivation involve photocatalysis and high-pressure treatments.
The former attained optimistic results until now and appears to
be suitable for diminishing viable phages suspended in the air
but, however, further research is needed. High-pressure treat-
ments were barely tested for phage inactivation as well; they
would fairly preserve cheese-making aptitude of milk, in con-
trast to strong thermal treatments, but tested phages exhibited
in general a high resistance to high pressure. Anyhow, two or
more inactivating strategies (maybe combining non-thermal with
thermal processes) should be applied either in parallel or consec-
utively to obtain better results. Future efforts should be directed to
determine the best combinations which permit generating a syn-
ergistic effect and thus softening the strength of each individual
treatment while accomplishing the highest phage-killing activity
possible.
