Abstract
B cells are capable of mounting responses to a bewildering range of potentially pathogenic antigens
through the production of high-affinity antibodies and the establishment of immunological memory. Thus,
regulated B-cell activation is critical for protection against a variety of bacterial and viral infections, as well
as cancers. Here, we discuss a number of recent imaging studies that have provided new insights into the
variety of mechanisms by which B-cell activation is initiated in the lymph node in vivo.

Introduction and context
The initiation of B-cell responses involves two distinct
events that are separated both spatially and temporally.
Initially, specific recognition of antigens by the B-cell
receptor (BCR) triggers intracellular signalling and
antigen internalization [1,2]. Secondly, processing
and presentation of internalized antigens to helper
T cells facilitates maximal B-cell activation and ulti-
mately the generation of plasma cells capable of anti-
body secretion [3,4].

Typically, the events of B-cell activation in vivo take place in
specialized secondary lymphoid tissues such as the lymph
nodes to increase the likelihood of a B cell ‘finding’ its cog-
nate antigen [5]. Lymph nodes are supplied with lymph-
atic fluid through the afferent vessel. The lymphatic fluid
contains a representative sample of the soluble and cell-
bound antigens found in the interstitial fluid. Upon entry
to the node, the lymphatic fluid is not allowed to diffuse
freely around the cortex but rather is moved around the
subcapsular sinus (SCS) towards the central medullary
region through trabecular sinuses. This restricted move-
ment raises questions as to how follicular B cells in the
lymph node interior gain access to lymph-borne antigens.
In fact, until relatively recently, the mechanisms by which
B cells initially encounter antigen and become activated
in vivo remained enigmatic.

Major recent advances
The mechanism by which lymph-borne antigens gain
access to the lymph node interior to activate follicular
B cells in vivo is dependent on characteristics of the antigen
itself and, in particular, its molecular mass. As such, Marc
Jenkins and colleagues observed that
fluorescently
labelled antigen below 70 kDa was able to diffuse into
the interior of the draining lymph node within minutes of
administration [6]. They demonstrated that according to
their vicinity to the SCS, follicular B cells were able to
acquire antigens and subsequently migrate to the border
of the T-cell zone to receive help from CD4+ T cells. It
was suggested that antigens gained access to follicular
B cells through small pores in the SCS, which had been
previously observed by electron microscopy [7-9]. How-
ever, as the existence of such pores has remained contro-
versial, the authors have suggested in hindsight that it
is more likely that the diffusion of small soluble antigens
occurs through a novel follicular conduit network, which
has been elegantly identified by the lab group led by
Michael Carroll [10]. The source of smaller antigens in vivo
remains questionable, though some recent evidence sug-
gests that serum proteases may be involved in liberating
antigens from the surface of pathogenic invaders [11].
Interestingly, the conduit network may offer the opportu-
nity to transport chemokines such as CXCL13 to regulate
the migration of follicular B cells towards the sites where

they are likely to encounter antigens [10]. In addition, it
seems that this conduit network occupies a strategic posi-
tion to allow follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) deep in the
follicle to gain access to small antigens in the lymphatic
fluid [12].

While the follicular conduit network provides a mechan-
ism for small antigens to access B cells in the follicle, like its
counterpart in the paracortex [13,14], the network pre-
cludes the free diffusion of larger antigens into the lymph
node interior [10]. Three independent studies have
demonstrated a role for a layer of CD169+ macrophages
positioned at the SCS in the acquisition of larger antigens
in the form of viruses, particulates, or immune complexes
[15-17]. In each of these cases, follicular B cells were obser-
ved arresting in proximity to SCS macrophages within an
hour of antigen administration and accumulating antigens
prior to migration to the follicular T-cell zone border. It
seems that these macrophages also play a general role in
retaining antigens at the SCS, as their removal through
clodronate liposomes not only impairs local B-cell activa-
tion but also leads to systemic dissemination of viruses
[16,18]. Furthermore,
it has been demonstrated
very recently that SCS macrophages also participate in
the prevention of central nervous system infection by
neurotropic viruses through the production of type 1
interferon [19]. Interestingly, these macrophages also
display intact antigens to non-cognate B cells so that
they can transport larger antigens from the SCS to FDCs in
a complement-dependent manner [17]. While it is known
that this transport is important for affinity maturation
[20], there is some evidence that antigens arrayed on the
surface of FDCs might also mediate activation of naive B
cells [21]. Indeed, this type of presentation would provide
an elegant means to improve the chances of extremely rare
B cells encountering cognate antigens.

The discovery that macrophages present intact antigens
to B cells was somewhat surprising given their usual role
as specialised phagocytes. However, as SCS macrophages
express low levels of lysosomal enzymes, it has been sug-
gested that they exhibit reduced phagocytic capacity com-
pared with medullary macrophages [20]. Furthermore, it
has been noted that SCS macrophages lack expression of
the mannose receptor – though it is not clear how this
impacts on the propensity for phagocytosis [22]. Intrigu-
ingly, however, it has been observed that CD8+ T cells
relocalize around infected cells in the SCS [23] and that
memory CD8+ T cells engage in prolonged interactions
with infected SCS macrophages [24]. This implies that SCS
macrophages may also be capable of presenting processed
antigens. Indeed this was formally established through the
demonstration that CD169+ SCS macrophages present
processed lipid antigens to initiate the activation of lymph

node invariant natural killer T cells [25]. In view of these
apparently contradictory lines of evidence, it seems that
SCS macrophages are capable of presenting both intact
and processed antigens to different immune cells. How-
ever, it is unclear at this stage which factors govern the
decision to recycle intact antigens to the cell surface or to
target these antigens for processing and presentation in
complex with major histocompatibilty complex mole-
cules. It seems likely that the cell surface receptor that
binds the antigen might play a role in this decision; for
example, in the case of SCS macrophages this might
involve FcgRIIB, Mac1 or SIGN-R1 as receptors for binding
of immune-complexed antigen, complement-coated anti-
gen, or carbohydrate-coated antigen, respectively [26].

Macrophages are not the only cell capable of presenting
native antigens to follicular B cells in lymph nodes. Early
observations suggested that dendritic cells (DCs) were
capable of interacting directly with B cells in vitro to
initiate activation [27]. In line with this, Ron Germain
and colleagues have demonstrated that DCs endocytose
and present antigen both in vitro and in vivo [28]. Further-
more, they showed that antigen-specific interactions with
DCs can occur outside of the follicle when B cells enter
the lymph node through high endothelial venules. This
atypical location for activation of follicular B cells leaves
them perfectly positioned to receive help from cognate
CD4+ T cells and, in line with this, ‘trios’ of B cells, T cells,
and DCs have been observed in this site [29]. Another
very recent study has highlighted a role for medullary
DCs in capturing influenza virus and the induction of
specific humoral immune responses [18]. Unlike uptake
by the SCS macrophages that requires opsonization with
mannose-binding lectin, capture by DCs was dependent
on binding to SIGN-R1.

Regardless of the mechanism that enables B cells to initially
encounter antigens, the second phase of B-cell activation
involves the migration of B cells to the B-cell–T-cell border
to receive help from cognate CD4+ T cells [30,31]. Activated
B cells then either form extrafollicular plasma cells capable
of low-affinity antibody production [32] or enter specia-
lized germinal centres (GCs) to undergo affinity matura-
tion to generate extremely high affinity antibodies [33]. In
GCs, after the initial ‘wave’ of antigens in lymphatic fluid
has passed, antigen presentation to follicular B cells con-
tinues and B cells are selected for on the basis of their
affinity for antigen accumulated on the surface of FDCs.
Three dynamic, recent investigations have visualized B-cell
dynamics in the GC during affinity maturation [34-36].
These independent studies demonstrated that B cells in
the GC exhibit an unusual morphology and are highly
motile, rarely making prolonged contact with FDCs.
Thus, it appears that FDC-mediated presentation of antigen

Lymphatic fluid containing antigens (red) enters the lymph node (centre) through afferent vessels and moves around the subcapsular sinus (SCS; brown),
gaining access to B cells through a variety of recently elucidated mechanisms. (A) Smaller antigens are moved through the follicular conduit network and
can gain access to cognate follicular B cells. (B-D) Larger antigens, such as immune complexes, are excluded from the conduit network and can be
presented on the surface of (B) SCS macrophages (light brown) or (C) follicular dendritic cells (dark blue) to cognate B cells in the follicles (grey).
Alternatively, (D) extrafollicular dendritic cells (orange) may present antigens to cognate B cells as they arrive in the node through the high endothelial
vessels (HEV; red). The SCS macrophages, shown in (B), have been the particular focus of a number of recent studies. These macrophages accumulate
larger antigens potentially through a variety of cell surface receptors according to the nature of the antigen itself. Accumulated antigen might either move
along the cell surface or enter intracellular vesicles and be recycled intact to the cell surface for presentation to cognate B cells through the B-cell
receptor (BCR), or to non-cognate B cells through complement receptors. In addition, antigen may enter into processing compartments such as
lysosomes for processing and presentation to CD8+ T cells or, in the case of lipid antigens, to invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells. MHC I, multi

to B cells potentially occurs through a different mechanism
than through SCS macrophages or medullary DCs.
Furthermore, examination of the rates of B-cell movement
between the two GC zones suggests that non-absolute
functional segregation between zones occurs, calling into
question the classical model of selection in the GC [33].

Future directions
Taken together these recent studies reveal a plethora of
alternative mechanisms by which follicular B cells can
encounter cognate antigen, such that we are beginning to
understand the initial events of B-cell activation in vivo.
Future investigations involving characterization of the
precise molecular requirements for antigen presentation

to B cells by SCS macrophages, DCs, and FDCs, and the
direct visualization of antigen throughout the process
of affinity maturation, will provide new insights into
the processes underlying B-cell activation in vivo. Along-
side these investigations, in vitro characterizations at the
single cell level using high-resolution imaging meth-
odologies will be exquisitely useful in dissecting the
different intrinsic molecular and cellular requirements
for recognition of soluble and membrane-bound anti-
gens. Indeed, through these types of studies, a critical role
for the B-cell cytoskeleton in the recognition of antigens
on a constrained surface is beginning to emerge, despite
being previously overlooked due to characterizations
carried out with soluble antigen stimulation [37].
