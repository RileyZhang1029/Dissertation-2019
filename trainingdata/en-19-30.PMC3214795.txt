ABSTRACT

from 

isolated 

the  Opuntia 

Opuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten.  is  widely  cultivated  in  Jeju  Island  (South  Korea)  for 
use  in  manufacture  of  health  foods.  This  study  described  antidepressant  effect  of  two 
flavonoids  (kaempferol  and  quercitrin) 
ficus-indica  var. 
saboten.  The  expression  of  the  hypothalamic  POMC  mRNA  or  plasma  β-endorphin 
levels  were  increased  by  extract  of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  or  its  flavoniods 
administered  orally.  In  addition,  antidepressant  activity  was  studied  using  tail  suspens-
ion  test  (TST),  forced  swimming  test  (FST)  and  rota-rod  test  in  chronically  restraint 
immobilization  stress  group  in  mice.  After  restraint  stress  (2  hrs/day  for  14  days), 
animals  were  kept  in  cage  for  14  days  without  any  further  stress,  bet  with  drugs.  Mice 
were  fed  with  a  diet  supplemented  for  14  days  and  during  the  behavioral  test  period 
with  kaempferol  or  quercitrin  (30  mg/kg/day).  POMC  mRNA  or  plasma  β-endorphin 
level  was  increased  by  extract  of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  and  its  flavoniods. 
In  addition,  immobility  time  in  TST  and  FST  was  significantly  reduced  by  kaempferol  or 
quercitrin.  In  rota-rod  test,  the  time  of  permanence  was  maintained  to  the  semblance 
of  control  group  in  turning  at  15  rpm.  Our  results  suggest  that  two  flavonoids 
(kaempferol  and  quercitrin)  isolated  from  the  Opuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten.  show  a 
potent  antidepressant  effect.

and  depression  disorders  (Ader  and  Cohen,  1993; 
McEwen  and  Stellar,  1993).  Stress  alters  the  home-
ostasis  of  many  regions  of  the  body,  including 
neural,  endocrine,  immune,  and  digestive  systems. 
Depression  is  a  disorder  characterized  by  a  broad 
range  of  symptoms,  including  altered  mood  and 
cognitive  functions,  and  recurrent  thoughts  of  death 
or  suicide.  In  contrast  with  the  normal  experiences 
of  sadness,  clinical  depression  is  a  chronic  disease 

to 

that  can  interfere  significantly  in  the  individual's  life 
quality.  Depression  constitutes  the  second  most 
common  chronic  condition 
in  clinical  practice 
(Whooley  and  Simon,  2000)  and  would  become  the 
second  leading  cause  of  premature  death  or  dis-
ability  worldwide  by  the  year  2020  (WHO,  1999). 
Approximately  two-thirds  of  the  anxious  or  depress-
ed  patients  respond 
the  currently  available 
treatments  but  the  magnitude  of  improvement  is  still 
disappointing  (Mora  et  al.,  2006).  Although  there 
are  many  effective  antidepressants  available  today, 
the  current  armentarium  of  therapy  is  often  inade-
quate  with  unsatisfactory  results  in  about  one  third 
of  all  subjects  treated.  This  necessitates  the  de-
velopment  of  new  and  more  effective  antide-
pressants  from  traditional  medicinal  plants  whose 
psychotherapeutic  potential  has  been  assessed  in  a 
variety  of  animal  models  (Zhang,  2004).
    Opuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  is  widely  cul-
tivated  in  Jeju  Island  (South  Korea)  for  use  in 
manufacture  of  health  foods  such  as  tea,  jam  and 
juice.  Its  fruits  and  stems  have  been  traditionally 
used  in  oriental  folk  medicines  to  treat  diabetes, 
hypertension,  asthma,  burns,  edema  and  indigestion 
(Lopez,  1995;  Ahn,  1998).  It  has  also  been  report-
ed 
fruits  or  stems  exhibit 
hypoglycemic  (Ibanez-Camacho  and  Roman-Ramos, 
1979;  Trejo-Gonzalez  et  al.,  1996),  anti-ulcer  (Galati 
et  al.,  2001),  and  anti-allergic  activities  (Lee  et  al., 
2000).  In  addition,  Park  et  al.  (1998)  reported 
analgesic  and  anti-inflammatory  activity  of  the  fruits 
and  the  stem  extracts  and  isolated  β-sitosterol  as 
an  active  anti-inflammatory  principle  from  the  stem 
extract 
(Park  et  al.,  2001).  However,  antide-
pressant-related  effect  of  Opuntia  ficus-indica  var. 
saboten.  has  not  been  well  characterized.  Thus,  the 
medicinal  importance  of  this  plant  motivated  us  to 
investigate  its  possible  antidepressant  effect.
    In  the  present  study,  the  possible  antidepressant 
effect  of  two  flavonoids  (kaempferol  and  quercitrin) 
isolated  from  the  Opuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten 
were  examined.  Here  we  demonstrate  that  both 
kaempferol  and  quercitrin  shows  anti-depressant 
effect  in  chronic  stress  mice  model,  consisting  of 
restraint  for  2  hr  daily  for  14  days.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

    These  experiments  were  approved  by  the  Uni-
versity  of  Hallym  Animal  Care  and  Use  Committee 
(registration  number:  Hallym  2009-05).  All  proce-
dures  were  conducted 
the 
‘Guide  for  Care  and  Use  of  Laboratory  Animals' 
published  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.

in  accordance  with 

Experimental  animals

for  all 

    Male  ICR  mice  (MJ  Co.,  Seoul,  Korea)  weighing 
20∼25  g  were  used 
the  experiments. 
Animals  were  housed  5  per  cage 
in  a  room 
maintained  at  22±0.5oC  with  an  alternating  12  hr 
light-dark  cycle.  Food  and  water  were  available  ad 
libitum.  The  animals  were  allowed  to  adapt  to  the 
laboratory  for  at  least  2  hr  before  testing  and  were 
only  used  once.  Experiments  were  performed 
during  the  light  phase  of  the  cycle  (10:00∼17:00).

Oral  administration

    Oral  administration  was  performed  with  gage  in  a 
volume  of  500μl/  25  g  bodyweight.

The  making  of  crude  extract  from  Opintia 
ficus-indica  var.  saboten

    Opuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  (300  g)  was 
dissolved  in  80%  ethanol  (1,500  ml)  and  extracted 
as  refluxing  for  3  hours,  and  then  the  extract  was 
filtered  for  obtaining  A.  This  process  was  repeated 
again  once  to  obtain  B  from  residue.  A  and  B  were 
mixed.  This  mixture  was  decompressed  and  dried 
for  using  as  extract  of  Opuntia  ficus-indica  var. 
saboten.

Isolation  of  total  RNA

three 

times 

    Three  animals  of  each  group  were  dissected  for 
Northern  blot  analysis.  Every  result  was  confirmed 
by 
independent  experiments.  Total 
cellular  RNA  was  extracted  from  dissected  pituitary 
gland  and  hypothalamus 
tissues  using  a  rapid 
guanidine  thiocyanate-watersaturated  phenol/chloro-
form  extraction  procedure  and  subsequent  precipi-
tation  with  acidic  sodium  acetate  (Chomczynski  and 
Sacchi,  1987).  Total  cellular  RNA  in  the  aqueous 
phase  was  precipitated  with 
isopropyl 
alcohol.  Isolated  RNA  samples  were  subjected  to 
spectrophotometric  analysis  at  260  nm  and  280  nm.

Preparation  of  digoxigenin  (DIG)-labeled  cRNA 
probes

    The  cRNA  probe  for  POMC  (Civelli  et  al.,  1982) 
was  synthesized  in  vitro  from  linearized  expression 
vectors  which  contained  SP6  or  T7  viral  promoter. 
One  microgram  of  linearized  plasmid  was  mixed 
that  contained  ATP, 
with  RNA  labeling  mixture 
CTP,  GTP  and  DIG-labeled-UTP, 
transcription 
buffer,  and  SP6  or  T7  RNA  polymerase.  After 
incubation  at  37oC 
the  mixture  was 
co-incubated  with  DNase  I  (RNase  free)  at  37oC  for 
15  min,  precipitated  in  ethanol  containing  lithium 
chloride  at  70oC  for  30  min,  and  washed  with  70% 
chilled  ethanol.

Non-isotopic  northern  blot  analysis

    Isolated  RNA  samples  were  dissolved  in  40∼50 
ml  water  and  a  400X  diluted  RNA  solution  was 
subjected  to  spectrophotometric  analysis  at  260  and 
280  nm.  Ten  micrograms  of  total  RNA  and  an 
equal  volume  of  RNA  loading  buffer  (50%  glycerol, 
1  mM  EDTA)  were  denatured  in  65oC  for  10  min 
and  subsequently  cooled  on  ice.  The  denatured 
RNA  samples  were  electrophoresed  on  1%  aga-
rose-formaldehyde  gels  under  6070  V  and  trans-
ferred  to  nylon  hybond-N  hybridization  membrane 
sheets  (Amersham,  Buckinghamshire,  UK).  After  UV 
cross-linking,  the  membranes  were  pre-hybridized  at 
68oC  for  at  least  1  h  in  a  prehybridization  buffer 
(5X  SSC,  50%  formamide,  0.02%  SDS,  0.1%  sodi-
um  N-lauroyl  sarcosine,  and  2%  blocking  reagent). 
The  DIG-labeled  POMC  probe  was  added  to  the 
prehybridization  buffer  containing  50%  formamide. 
The  membranes  were  incubated  overnight  at  68oC 
in  a  shaking  waterbath,  and  washed  twice  for  10 
min  per  wash  in  2X  SSC  and  0.1%  SDS  at  room 
temperature.  Then  the  membranes  were  washed 
twice  for  15  min  per  wash  0.1X  SSC  and  0.1% 
SDS.  After  equilibrating  the  membranes  in  Buffer  I 
(100  mM  maleic  acid  [pH  7.5]  and  150  mM  NaCl) 
for  1  min,  the  membranes  were  gently  agitated  in 
Buffer  II  (1%  blocking  reagent  in  Buffer  I)  for  30∼
60  min.  The  membranes  were  hybridized  with  the 
diluted  anti-DIG-alkaline  phosphatase  (1：10,000 
[75  mU/ml])  in  Buffer  II  for  30  min.  After  washing 
the  membranes  twice  for  15  min  per  wash  in  0.3% 
Tween  20  (in  Buffer 
the  membranes  were 
equilibrated  in  Buffer  III  (100  mM  Tris-HCl  [pH  9.5], 

I), 

100  mM  NaCl,  and  50  mM  MgCl2)  for  2  min. 
Diluted  disodium  3-[4-methoxyspiro  (1,2-dioxietane- 
3,2’-[5’-chloro]  tricycle  [3.3.1.1.3,7decan]-4-yl)  phenyl 
phosphate  (CSPD)  (Boehringer  Mannheim)  (1：100 
dilution  in  Buffer  III)  was  spread  over  the  surface  of 
the  membranes.  After  incubation  of  the  membranes 
at  37oC  for  15∼20  min,  the  membranes  were 
exposed  to  Hyperfilm-ECL  (Amersham)  for  detection 
of  the  chemiluminescent  signal.  For  rehybridization, 
blots  were  washed  for  20  min  at  room  temperature 
in  sterilized  (Millipore)  water.  The  membranes  were 
washed  overnight  at  65oC  in  50  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH 
8.0),  50%  dimethylformamide  and  1%  SDS 
to 
remove  the  hybridized  probe  and  rehybridized  to 
the  DIG-labeled  rat  cyclophilin  cRNA  probe,  a  gene 
encoding  peptidyl-prolyl  cis-trans  isomerase  which  is 
constitutively  constitutively  expressed  in  most  mam-
malian  tissues  with  the  exception  of  skeletal  mus-
cles  (Danielson  et  al.,  1988;  Takahashi  et  al., 
1989).

Plasma  β-endorphin  ELISA  analysis

in 

then 

this  kit 

    The  blood  sample  was  collected  three  times  (30, 
90  and  180  min)  or  90  min  after  oral  administration 
of  the  diluted-extract  (1,000  and  2,000  mg/kg)  or 
kaempferol  (10,  25  and  50  mg/kg)  or  quercitrin  (10, 
25  and  50  mg/kg),  and 
the  serum  was 
obtained  by  centrifuge  (4oC,  1,600×g,  15  min).  We 
observed  the  serum  β-endorphin  level  with  ELISA 
kit  (Phoenix  pharmaceutical,  INC).  The  immuno-
plaste 
is  pre-coated  with  secondary 
antibody  and  nonspecific  binding  sites  are  blocked. 
The  secondary  antibody  can  bind 
the  Fc 
fragment  of  the  primary  antibody  (peptide  antibody) 
whose  Fab  fragment  will  be  competitively  bound  by 
both  biotinylated  peptide  and  peptide  standard  or 
targeted  peptide  in  sample.  The  biotinylated  peptide 
is  able 
interact  with  streptavidin-horseradish 
peroxidase  (SA-HRP)  which  catalyzes  the  substrate 
solution  composed  of  3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine 
(TMB)  and  hydrogen  peroxide  to  produce  a  blue 
colored  solution.  The  enzyme-substrate  reaction  is 
stopped  by  hydrogen  chloride  (HCL)  and  the  solut-
ion  turns  to  yellow.

Restraint  stress  and  drug  treatment

    Stress  treatment  procedure  has  been  described 
previously  (Kim  and  Han,  2006).  To  deliver  rest-

in 

their  original  cages  and  were 

raint,  8-week-old  mice  weighing  22∼23  g  were 
individually  placed  head-first  into  a  well-ventilated 
50-ml  conical  tube  and  plugged  with  a  3  cm  long 
middle  tube  and  finally  the  cap  of  the  50  ml  tube. 
Mice  were  not  able  to  move  forward  or  backward  in 
this  device.  This  restraint  stress  was  delivered  to 
animals  at  set  times  daily  from  10  AM.  Control  mice 
remained 
left 
undisturbed  in  this  home  environment.  After  rest-
raint  stress  administration,  restrained  animals  were 
returned  to  their  normal  home  environments  by 
housing  them  in  pairs.  This  procedure  was  repeated 
for  14  days  unless  otherwise 
indicated.  After 
restraint,  animals  were  kept  in  their  normal  home 
cages 
fourteen  days  without  any 
further  stress,  but  with  drugs.  Mice  were  fed  with  a 
diet  supplemented  for  14  days  and  during  the 
behavioral  test  period  with  kaempferol  or  quercitrin 
(Sigma)  (30  mg/kg/day).  Behavioral 
tests  were 
the  sequence  of  TST,  FST,  and 
in 
performed 
rota-rod  tests.

Tail  suspension  test  (TST)

    Mice  were  suspended  individually  by  their  tail 
from  a  metal  rod.  The  rod  was  fixed  50  cm  above 
the  surface  of  a  table  covered  with  soft  cloth  in  a 
sound-isolated  room.  The  tip  of  the  tail  was  fixed 
using  adhesive  Scotch  tape;  the  duration  of  the  test 
was  6  min.  The  immobility  time  was  determined  by 
an  observer,  using  a  stopwatch,  who  was  unaware 
of  the  strain  (Steru  et  al.,  1985;  Bilkei-Gorzo  et  al., 
2002).

Forced  swim  test  (FST)

    Mice  were  placed  in  a  Plexiglas  cylinder  (height: 
27  cm,  diameter:  15  cm)  containing  water  at  24oC 
and  a  depth  of  14  cm  so  that  they  could  neither 
escape  nor  touch  the  bottom.  Mice  were  subjected 
to  a  15-min  pre  swim.  After  a  15-min  test,  the 
animals  were  dried  quickly  with  a 
towel  and 
returned  to  home  cages.  One  day  later,  mice  were 
forced 
for  6  min.  The  animals  were 
habituated  for  the  first  1  min  and  behavior  was 
noted  over  the  next  5  min.  Immobility  time  was 
defined  as  the  summed  time  during  which  animals 
remained  floating  with  all  limbs  motionless.  This 
scoring  method  has  been  described  previously 
(Porsolt  et  al.,  1977;  Armario  et  al.,  1988;  1991;

Rota-rod  test

    Mice  were  evaluated  on  their  motor  activity  using 
Rota-rod  tested  at  10  or  15  rpm.  The  time  mice 
remained  on  the  Rota  Rod  was  recorded.  Maximum 
time  was  adjusted  to  5  min.

Drugs

    Kaempferol  and  quercitrin  were  purchased  from 
Sigma  Chemical  Co.  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  Extract 
of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  and  quercitirin 
were  dissolved  in  saline.  Kaempferol  was  prepared 
following  steps:  (A)  1  g  of  kaempferol  was  dis-
solved  in  0.5  ml  of  ethanol  plus  0.5  ml  of  poly-
ethylene  glycol  400.  (B)  Separately,  100  mg  of 
sodium  carboxymethylcellulose  was  dissolved  in  9 
ml  of  distilled  water.  (C)  Finally,  Solution  (A)  and 
Solution  (B)  were  vigorously  mixed.  This  solution 
excluding  kaempferol  was  used  as  vehicle  control. 
All  drugs  were  prepared  just  before  use.

Statistical  analysis

    ELISA  data  was  presented  as  the  mean±SEM. 
The  statistical  significance  of  differences  between 
groups  was  assessed  with  one-way  ANOVA  with 
Bonferroni’s  post-hoc  test  using  GraphPad  Prism 
version  4.0  for  Windows  XP  (GraphPad  Software, 
San  Diego,  CA,  USA);  p＜0.05  was  considered 
significant.  Behavior 
two-sample  com-
parisons  were  carried  out  using  the  Student's  t-test, 
and  multiple  comparisons  were  made  using  one- 
way  ANOVA, 
the  Newman-Keuls 
multiple  range  test.  All  data  are  presented  as  mean

RESULTS

The  expression  of  the  hypothalamic  POMC 
mRNA  and  plasma  β-endorphin  level  elicited 
by  extract  of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten 
administered  orally

    Extract  of  Ofuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  (1  or 
2  g/kg)  was  administered  orally 
in  mice,  and 
hypothalamus  was  dissected  or  blood  sample  was 
collected  at  30,  90  and  180  min  after  administration 
of  extract  of  Ofuntia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten.  The 
control  group  was  administered  0.9%  normal  saline 
orally  instead  of  the  extract.  In  the  northern-blot 
assay,  we  found  that  POMC  mRNA  was  increased 
in  extract-treated  group  compared  to  control  group 
at  all  times  (Fig.  2A).  In  ELISA  method,  we  found 
that  plasma  β-endorphin  level  was  increased  by 
extract  of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten  (Fig.  2B). 
In  30  min  after  oral  administration,  plasma  β- 
endorphin  level  was  increased  in  extreat-treated 
group  of  2,000  mg/kg  compared  to  control  group.  In 
90  min  after  oral  administration,  plasma  β-endor-
phin  level  was  increased  slightly  in  both  extract- 
treated  group,  but  not  significantly.  In  180  min  after 
oral  administration,  plasma  β-endorphin  level  was 
increased  significantly  in  dose  dependent  manner  in 
extract-treated  group  (1  and  2  g/kg)  compared  to 
control  group.

saboten  (1,000  and  2,000  mg/kg)  administered  orally.  Total 
constitutively  expressed  ribosomal  RNA  (18S  and  28S)  was  used 
as  an  internal  loading  control.  The  number  of  animal  used  for 
each  group  was  3.  (B)  For  ELISA,  the  whole  mouse  blood 
sample  was  collected.  ELISA  was  performed  at  time  points  (30, 
90  and  180  min)  after  saline  or  extract  of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var. 
saboten  (1,000  and  2,000  mg/kg)  administered  orally.  The 
vertical  bars  indicate  the  standard  error  of  the  mean.  The  number

was  collected  after  90  min.  In  ELISA  method,  we 
found  that  plasma  β-endorphin  level  was  increased 
by  kaempferol  and  quercitrin  (Fig.  3).  Plasma  β- 
endorphin  level  was  increased  significantly  in  dose 
dependent  manner 
in  kaempferol  or  quercitrin 
treated  group  compared  to  control  group.

DISCUSSION

in 

the 

this  homeostasis 

    The  opioid  system  has  been  implicated  in  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  some  antidepressants.  In 
this  regard,  it  has  been  proposed  that  involvement 
of  the  opioid  system  in  the  antidepressants’  mecha-
nism  of  action  may  be  necessary  in  order  to  prove 
effective 
treatment  of  severe  depression 
(Schreiber  et  al.,  2002).  Excessive  stress  is  related 
to  hyperpiesia,  diabetes,  a  gastric  ulcer  and 
depression.  Reaction  against  stressful  stimuli 
is 
necessary  to  maintain  human  homeostasis.  The 
endocrine,  metabolism,  autoimmune  and  psycholo-
gical  disease  arises  when 
is 
destroyed.  CRH  (corticotropin-releasing  hormone), 
arginine  vasopressin,  peptide,  glucocorticoid,  cate-
cholamine  are  related  to  stressful  system.  Espe-
cially,  POMC  is  a  precursor  of  β-endorphin  com-
posed  of  active  peptides  such  as  ACTH  (adreno-
corticotropin),  melanotropin,  α,  β,  and  α-MSH  in 
other  brain  regions  as  well  as  pituitary  gland.  These 
peptides  were  produced  by  complicate  translation  of 
POMC  (Krieger  et  al.,  1977).  As  mentioned  above, 
stressful  system  reactivation  destroys  stress  circuit 
homeostasis  as  releasing  sustained  ACTH  when 
chronic  stressful  stimuli  were  applied  (Sapolsky, 
2003).  In  addition,  β-endorphin  positive  cell  body  in 
arcuate  nucleus  project  to  PVN  (Paraventricular 
nucleus)  (Akil  et  al.,  1984),  suggesting  that  CRH  in 
paraventricular  nucleus 
(PVN)  of  hypothalamus 
correlate  with  in  β-endorphin  positive  neuron  in 
arcuate  nucleus.  These  suggest  that  β-endorphin 
may  perform  an 
in 
stressful  response.
    In  the  present  study,  we  show  that  POMC  mRNA 
or  plasma  β-endorphin  level  was  increased  by 
extract  of  Opintia  ficus-indica  var.  saboten.  and  its 
flavoniods  such  as  kaempferol  and  quercitrin.  These 
results  suggest  that  the  Opuntia  ficus-indica  var. 
saboten.  and  its  two  flavonoids  increase  β-endor-
phin,  which  may  perform  as  an  important  physiolo-
gical  regulator  in  response  to  depression.

mobility  behavior  displayed  in  rodents  when  sub-
jected  to  an  unavoidable  and  inescapable  stress 
has  been  hypothesized  to  reflect  behavioral  despair 
which  in  turn  may  reflect  depressive  disorders  in 
humans.  There  is,  indeed,  a  significant  correlation 
between  clinical  potency  and  effectiveness  of  an-
tidepressants  in  both  models  (Porsolt  et  al.,  1977; 
Steru  et  al.,  1985;  Cryan  et  al.,  2002).  Rota-rod

    The  main  finding  of  the  present  investigation

noids  (kaempferol  and  quercitrin)  isolated  from  the

and  quercitrin  significantly  reduced  the  immobility 
period  in  both  TST  and  FST.  In  addition,  the  time 
of  permanence  was  maintained  to  the  semblance  of 
control  group  in  rota-rod  test.
    The  TST  and  FST  are  widely  used  for  screening

To  establish  a  practical  animal  model  for  chronic 
stress  studies,  in  the  present  study  we  examined 
the  usefulness  of  the  rationale  that  the  psychiatric 
traits  anxiety  and  depression-related  behavior  can 
be  used  as  stress  assessment  parameters.  After 
restraint  stress  (2  hrs.day  for  14  days),  animals 
were  kept  in  cage  for  another  14  days  of  period 
without  any  further  stress,  bet  with  drugs.  Mice 
were  fed  with  a  diet  supplemented  for  14  days  and 
during  the  behavioral  test  period  with  kaempferol  or 
quercitrin  (30  mg/kg/day).
    Pretreatment  with  kaempferol  or  quercitrin  exhi-
bited  significant  of  immobility  time  in  TST  and  FST. 
So,  the  escape-directed  behaviours  with  minimal 
immobile  posture  showed  by  kaempferol  or  quer-
citrin  treated  rats  may  be  due  to  its  attenuating 
effect  in  endogenous  depression.  The  underlying 
principle  measuring 
lack  of  active  coping 
behavior  is  identical  in  the  TST  and  FST,  but  their 
variability  in  response  to  certain  antidepressants 
indicates  potentially  different  substrates  and  neuro-
chemical  pathways  mediating  performance  in  these 
tests.  These  issues  may  underlie  the  observed 
behavioral  differences  (Bai  et  al.,  2001).  Further-
more,  one  of  the  most  important  differences  bet-
ween  these  two  models  is  the  response  to  drugs  in 
both  tests  and  the  apparent  increased  sensitivity  of 
the  TST.  The  mouse  FST  has  not  traditionally  been 
viewed  as  a  consistently  sensitive  model  for  detect-
ing  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  activity, 
whereas  these  antidepressants  are  generally  report-
ed  as  active  in  the  TST  (Cryan  et  al.,  2005). 
Moreover,  the  TST  was  proposed  to  have  a  greater 
pharmacological  sensitivity  as  compared  with  the 
FST  (Thierry  et  al.,  1986;  Cryan  et  al.,  2005). 
Remarkably,  TST  detects  the  anti-immobility  effects 
of  a  wide  array  of  antidepressants,  including  tricyclic 
antidepressants  (TCA),  selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitors 
inhibitors 
(MAOI),  electro-convulsive  shock  (ECS),  and  even 
atypical  antidepressants.  Thus, 
the  activity  of 
kaempferol  or  quercitrin  could  involve  one  of  the 
mechanisms  of  the  established  agents  as  described 
above.
    In  summary,  our  results  suggest  that  Opuntia 
ficus-indica  var.  saboten.  and 
flavonoids 
(kaempferol  and  quercitrin)  isolated  from  the  Opun-
