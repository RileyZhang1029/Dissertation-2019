Introduction  In 2006, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were ﬁrst generated from mouse ﬁbroblasts by forced expression of four protein factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc, mediated by retrovirus [1].
Human cells can also be reprogrammed using the same set of four factors [2] or Oct4, Sox2, Lin28 and Nanog [3].
iPS cells were proven to exhibit pluripotency at lev- els similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Production and hosting by Elsevier  pluripotent stem cells can be produced without the problems of immune rejection for disease models, transplantation thera- pies and regenerative medicine.
However, iPS technology is complicated by the potential risks posed by genome-integrating viruses.
The transgenes are randomly but permanently integrated into the host genome at multiple sites together with viral vector backbone.
The expression of exogenous transgenes is silenced after repro- gramming is achieved, and this silencing is indispensable for maintaining pluripotency.
Such genome-integrating viral vec- tors can produce insertional mutations which may inﬂuence differentiation potential, or even result in tumorigenesis due to reactivation of the c-Myc oncogene [4].
Reprogramming methods that utilize viral vectors are therefore judged too risky to be used in clinical therapies.
Recently, several approaches have been developed to generate safer transgene-free or integration-free iPS cells, as listed in Table 1.

Non-integrating vectors  Episomal vectors  A series of non-integrating vectors, including viral vectors and non-viral vectors, have been used successfully for generating iPS cells.
Adenovirus  Replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors were used to gen- erate iPS cells from mouse [5] and human [6] somatic cells.
These vectors allow for transient expression of exogenous genes without integration into the host genome, although with a low efﬁciency compared to integrating vectors [5].
Sendai virus  Sendai virus (SeV) is thought to be able to replace retrovirus, since it is also an RNA virus and can be easily removed by antibody-mediated negative selection.
SeV replicates in the form of single-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells, therefore DNA would be neither produced nor integrated into the host genome during transduction.
Thus it has been used as a safe vector in the ﬁeld of gene therapy.
SeV-derived transgenes were expressed three days after transduction.
The resulting iPS cells were generated with a high efﬁciency [7], and the SeV vectors were then diluted by cell passages [7].
Expression plasmids  Other types of non-integrating vectors were explored to intro- duce reprogramming factors into mouse or human somatic cells.
For example, portions of the Epstein-Barr human herpesvirus were used to create a vector that can be transfected without viral packaging.
The resulting extrachromosomal oriP/EBNA1 (Ep- stein-Barr nuclear antigen-1) episomal vector also features a drug selection mechanism for removing the vector from cells.
The oriP/EBNA1 vector undergoes stable extrachromosomal replication only once per cell cycle, without integrating into the host genome.
However, efﬁciency for iPS generation using episomal vector was very low (3 6   10 6) [9].
Okita et al.
[10] further improved the episomal vector by using p53 suppression and non-transforming L-Myc instead of c-Myc, resulting in markedly enhanced iPS generation (1   10 5 3   10 4).
Minicircle vector  Minicircle expression vectors (i.e., supercoiled DNA molecules that lack a bacterial origin of replication) have higher transfec- tion efﬁciencies and longer-term transgene expression com- pared to plasmids due to reduced silencing for exogenous genes.
A single minicircle vector containing four reprogram- ming factors was introduced into human ES cells by nucleofec- tion, and the minicircle plasmid backbone was then excised and degraded using the PhiC31-based intramolecular recombi- nation system [11].
Several classes of vectors have been used as viral substitutes to produce transgene-free iPS cells without integration, and expression plasmids were among the ﬁrst to be investigated.
Repeated transfection of the plasmids containing the four Yamanaka factors into mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) resulted in iPS cells without integration, although with a much lower efﬁciency than viral vectors [8].
Liposomal magnetofection  For liposomal magnetofection (LMF), cationic lipids mediate the self-assembly of complexes containing plasmids and nano- particles of superparamagnetic iron.
These   CombiMag- DNA   ternary complexes can be concentrated at cell surfaces using a strong magnetic ﬁeld to transfect vectors into the   286  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 284 287  targeted cells.
An optimized LMF protocol for generating iPS cells achieved short reprogramming times of 8 days or less.
In addition, out of seven independently-generated iPS lines, two iPS lines that had no integrated vector were produced [12].
8 weeks after six rounds of transduction using four reprogram- ming factors fused with 9-arginine and myc tags.
The resulting induction efﬁciency was approximately twice as high as that using viral transduction.
Deletion after integration  mRNAs  Two systems have been applied to remove integrated trans- genes from mouse or human iPS cells.
Cre-loxP system  Cre/loxP recombination was used to excise integrated trans- genes from iPS cells.
Human iPS cells were produced using a single retroviral vector carrying OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC linked via picornaviral 2A plasmids.
This cassette was removed by transfection of Cre recombinase after reprogramming was achieved.
However, residual vector se- quences were left behind, therefore insertional mutations re- main a risk [13].
piggyBac transposon  Another system used seamless excision of piggyBac (PB) trans- posons to produce vector- and transgene-free mouse iPS cells.
Inverted terminal repeats derived from the PB transposon are used to ﬂank a transgene with recognition sequences for a trans- posase enzyme.
Insertions and excisions can then be triggered by regulated, transient expression of the transposase.
The four fac- tors were transfered into the PB transposon plasmid under the transcriptional control of the tetO2 tetracycline/doxycycline inducible promoter.
MEF were transfected with circular PB transposon plasmid together with a PB transposase expression plasmid, and then maintained in the presence of doxycycline.
After complete reprogramming, excision of the piggyBac vector and its induction factors from iPS cell lines was achieved with a pulse of PB transposase expression.
In 10 out of 11 subclone lines, the sequence at the transposon inte- gration site reverted to wild type after vector excision [14,15].
DNA-free delivery  Proteins  Alternative methods to avoid introducing genetic modiﬁca- tions include delivery of the reprogramming proteins or mRNA directly into cells, rather than their expression from DNA.
These methods have been successfully demonstrated but can be much more complicated to perform.
To generate recombinant proteins that can penetrate and cross the plasma membrane of somatic cells, the carboxy termini of four reprogramming factors were fused to a poly-arginine protein transduction domain.
After being added to the cell culture med- ium, the recombinant transcription factors readily entered cells within 6 h and could translocate to the nucleus.
iPS cells were ob- tained after four repeated protein transductions at 8 mg/ml with 1 mM valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that can signiﬁcantly improve reprogramming efﬁciency [16].
Similar protein transduction was also accomplished by Kim et al.
[17].
Human iPS cell-like colonies were established within  The use of synthetic RNAs for reprogramming was reported by Warren et al.
with surprisingly high reprogramming efﬁciencies [18].
mRNAs including 30 and 50 untranslated regions were syn- thesized via in vitro transcription.
RNA transfection with a cat- ionic vehicle into MEF and human somatic cells revealed a high, dose dependent cytotoxicity.
Modiﬁed ribonucleotides and phosphatase treatment, in conjunction with media supple- mented with the interferon inhibitor B18R, were used to opti- mize the synthetic mRNA approach and improve cell viability.
Maximal protein expression was observed 12 18 h after transfection, followed by a rapid turnover that necessitates subsequent daily transfections.
A ﬁve-factor cocktail including a modiﬁed LIN28 RNA produced reprogramming efﬁciencies of 1.4%, much higher than using the virus-based approach (10 4), and with a shorter time period (around 18 days) [18].
Chemical induction  Small molecules have advantages because they are non-immu- nogenic, and can be more easily administered and standardized.
Moreover, their effects on inhibiting or activating speciﬁc pro- teins are often reversible and dose dependent.
Small molecule li- braries and combinations of compounds have been screened to identify substitutes for transgenic DNA delivery.
Initially, iPS cells were generated from mouse ﬁbroblasts using a single gene, Oct4, with a small molecule combination termed   VC6T   [VPA, CHIR99021 (CHIR), 616452 and tranylcypromine] [19].
Next, chemical substitutes for Oct4 were screened as supplements to VC6T to obtain transgene-free iPS cells.
In the Oct4 promoter- driven GFP expression (OG) system, some GFP-positive clus- ters were induced by VC6T plus forskolin (VC6TF), however they lacked expression of Oct4 and Nanog, indicating incom- plete reprogramming [20].
To identify the chemicals critical for late reprogramming, a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Oct4 expression system was used in which DOX was added only in the ﬁrst 4 8 days.
Several cAMP agonists including forskolin, prostaglandin E2 and rolipram, and epigenetic modulators such as 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), 5-azacytidine, sodium buty- rate and RG108 were identiﬁed [20].
Among all the candidates, DZNep was proven to work well.
DZNep was added 16 days after treatment with VC6TF, followed by a day 28 switch to 2i-medium for dual inhibition (2i) of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK-3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) sig- naling.
The resulting chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) developed into colonies with ES-like properties.
Efﬁ- ciency can be boosted by a synthetic retinoic acid receptor li- gand, TTNPB, for up to 0.2% cells induced [20].
DZNep is critical for activating endogenous Oct4.
As an S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase inhibitor, DZNep may repress the SAM-dependent cellular methylation process and signiﬁcantly decrease DNA and H3K9 methylation at the Oct4 promoter, which may contribute to Oct4 activation.
These ﬁndings indicate that appropriate combinations of inducing chemicals and previously characterized drugs can   Zhou YY and Zeng F / Integration-free Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells  287  provide attractive mechanisms and applications for potential clinical utility, bypassing nucleic acid manipulations and the need to deploy protein factors.
Perspective  The efﬁciency and safety of generating and using iPS cells seem to show a negative correlation, and thus clinical applications of iPS technology await the validation of a mature protocol that better balances these two important elements.
Generation of iPS cells by recombinant proteins is still worth considering for clinical use due to its high safety, despite being quite expensive and having very low efﬁciency.
Recent reports point out that activation of toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3) leads to epigenetic modiﬁcation and facilitates nuclear reprogramming by the four inducing factors [21].
Therefore, TLR3 manipulation may sup- port nuclear reprogramming with a much higher efﬁciency com- pared to using retrovirally encoded proteins alone.
Additionally, mRNA transduction was reported to have high efﬁciency, but the rapid turnover of mRNA complicates this approach and necessitates repeated, daily transfections.
The newly reported chemical induction method is promising for clinical use, owing to its high safety and feasibility.
Moreover, the chimeric mice generated from CiPSCs were 100% viable and apparently healthy, unlike those generated from retrovirus-induced iPS cells.
Chemical library screening for TLR3 activators could lead to reﬁnements in the CiPSC induction cocktail and protocol that further boost efﬁciency.
Additional veriﬁcation of CiPSCs including tetraploid complementation is needed to conﬁrm stem cell function before its extensive application.
Nonetheless, CiP- SCs provide a new tool to study the mechanisms of reprogram- ming that may lead to more improvements in iPS cell production and safety, and eventually powerful iPS cell therapeutics.
