The relationship between oral health and systemic conditions, including the association between poor oral
hygiene, periodontal disease, and respiratory disease, has been increasingly debated over recent decades.
A considerable number of hypotheses have sought to explain the possible role of oral bacteria in the
pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, and some clinical and epidemiological studies have found results
favoring such an association. This review discusses the effect of oral bacteria on respiratory disease, briefly
introduces the putative biological mechanisms involved, and the main factors that could contribute to this
relationship. It also describes the role of oral care for individuals who are vulnerable to respiratory infections.

The oral cavity hosts a highly diverse microbiota

(1). Because of its humidity and temperature, the
mouth provides an appropriate environment for
the development of organized bacterial communities.
These occur as biofilms on both hard surfaces (teeth) as
well as the soft tissue of the stomatognathic system (2). It
should be emphasized that these communities are com-
plex organizations and include a wide variety of different
species of bacteria with varying degrees of virulence (3).
Dental plaque biofilms containing periodontal patho-
gens may give rise to periodontal disease, the manifestation
of which is determined by the virulence of the bacteria, the
host immunological response, and environmental factors
such as smoking (4).

Thus, it can be said that periodontal disease, which is a
population-wide health problem, results from an imbal-
ance between the bacteria and the host’s defense capacity
modified by the presence of environmental factors. In-
vestigations carried out in several countries have revealed
that the more advanced forms of periodontal disease
appear to affect some 520% of the population (5, 6).

Over recent years, oral bacteria and, especially, period-
ontal pathogens have been implicated as important agents
with regard to causing other illnesses including respiratory
diseases (7, 8, 10, 11). This hypothesis has been supported
particularly by studies of patients receiving treatment in
intensive care units: because of the cause of hospit-
alization, most patients present with an inadequate

immunological response, and with reductions in salivation
and the natural cleaning of the mouth that is promoted by
mastication and tongue movement. This, together with the
fact that oral care under these conditions is frequently
negligent, facilitates bacterial colonization (9).

As yet however, it is unknown if oral bacteria plays
a causal role in respiratory diseases. At present, only
conjecture exists regarding this possibility; the present
article will attempt to bring together the possible mechan-
isms and to compare the empirical findings from studies
investigating the association.

Biological mechanisms involved in the possible
association between oral conditions and
respiratory diseases
Four possible mechanisms to explain the biological
plausibility of an association between oral conditions
and nosocomial respiratory infections have been de-
scribed (7, 12).

1. Oral pathogens directly aspirated into the lungs.
There is evidence in the literature indicating that
periodontal organisms
such as Porphyromonas
gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemomi-
tans are involved in aspiration pneumonia (1315).
Furthermore, it is important to understand that the
dental biofilm can be colonized by pulmonary
pathogens, thus strengthening the idea that the
oral cavity may constitute a reservoir for pathogens

that are responsible for aspiration pneumonia in
high-risk patients (1619).

2. Salivary enzymes associated with periodontal disease
modify respiratory tract mucosal surfaces. In this
hypothesis salivary enzymes associated with period-
ontal disease modify respiratory tract mucosal
surfaces and promote adhesion and colonization
by respiratory pathogens, with consequent aspira-
tion into the lungs thereby causing infection. The
possible mechanisms of mucosal surface modifica-
tion leading to enhanced adhesion include:
(a)
modification of
the mucosal epithelium due to
high levels of proteolytic periodontal bacteria and
their specific enzymes such as mannosidase, fucosi-
dase, hexosaminidase, and sialidase;
loss of
surface fibronectin,
the protein that covers the
mucosa resulting in de-masking of surface receptors;
(c) removal of surface fibronectin by hydrolytic
enzymes; and (d) release of cytokines. However, it
is known that even though saliva contains a great
variety of hydrolytic enzymes, salivary enzymatic
activity is related to an individual’s oral hygiene and
periodontal condition (20, 21). Moreover, the source
of these salivary enzymes has been attributed to
both the oral microbiota (20, 2226) and to poly-
morphonuclear leukocytes entering the saliva from
the gingival sulcus/pocket. Thus, the worse the oral
hygiene and the poorer the oral condition, the higher
the enzymatic activity will be and the greater the
possibility of mucosal changes,
thereby increas-
ing the adhesion and colonization by respiratory
pathogens (27).

results

3. Hydrolytic enzymes from periodontopathic bacteria
may destroy the salivary film that protects against
pathogenic bacteria. This may reduce the ability of
mucins to adhere to pathogens such as Haemophilus
influenzae, thus leaving them free to adhere to
mucosal receptors in the respiratory tract. In turn,
this
in fewer non-specific host defense
mechanisms in high-risk individuals. P. gingivalis,
for example, produces enzymes that degrade these
salivary molecules as well as producing other
enzymes that degrade the salivary film on the
mucosal surface, thereby exposing adhesion recep-
tors to respiratory pathogens. In the same way as
cited previously, individuals with poor oral hygiene
may have high levels of hydrolytic enzymes in their
saliva.

4. The presence of a large variety of cytokines and other
biologically active molecules continually released from
periodontal tissues and peripheral mononuclear cells.
In cases of untreated periodontal disease in high-risk
individuals,
the presence of a large variety of
cytokines and other biologically active molecules
continually released from periodontal tissues and

peripheral mononuclear cells may alter the respira-
tory epithelium and promote colonization by res-
piratory pathogens via the upregulation of adhesion
receptor expression on the mucosal surfaces, thereby
resulting in infection.

Evidence from clinical and epidemiological
studies
Recent studies have identified the bacteria present in the
oral cavity and dental biofilm as potential pathogens
in the etiology of nosocomial infection of the respiratory
tract, notably in patients undergoing orotracheal intu-
bation in intensive care units (26, 2830). Such indivi-
duals have thus been recognized as a group that is
vulnerable to this respiratory infection, given that they
commonly present with neglected oral hygiene.

Among the groups that are vulnerable to this infection,
geriatric patients stand out, since such individuals present
with lowered levels of neuromotor activity in relation to
deglutition and cough reflex, incompetent lower esopha-
geal sphincter (31), and greater prevalence of dental
caries (especially radicular caries) and periodontitis. The
presence of poor oral health in individuals who are
susceptible to bronchoaspiration may lead to states of
infection of
these
patients are in hospital environments (3234).

the respiratory tract, especially if

Certain contributing factors need to be taken into
consideration in analyzing the possible association
between oral conditions and respiratory diseases. These
include advanced age, the nature of the dental biofilm, the
number of periodontally compromised teeth, the length of
hospital stay, the use of antibiotics, oral care methods, and
certain lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol
consumption.

With respect to age, as noted above, it is believed that
elderly individuals have a greater susceptibility to chronic
inflammatory diseases and microbial infections such as
periodontitis and pneumonia due to aspiration of oral
organisms. It has also been suggested that, with advanced
age, phagocytes may undergo significant changes in terms
of signal
transduction pathways thus affecting their
capacity to regulate the inflammatory response or to
perform certain antimicrobial
(35). Some
authors have also suggested that the frequency of hospital
bacterial infection increases with age, not because of a
greater hospitalization rate, but because of an increased
risk per day of hospital stay (36).

functions

With regard to colonization of the dental biofilm,
1 mm3 of plaque contains more than 106 bacteria with
300 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic
species (37). Studies have shown that this combination
of bacterial deposits and salivary constituents form a
reservoir of respiratory pathogens such as Staphylococcus
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are capable
of provoking pneumonia and pulmonary abscesses in

individuals hospitalized in intensive care units (16, 17).
Bacteria such as P. gingivalis and S. aureus have been
identified in saliva as predictors of respiratory disease
(38), independent of the presence or absence of teeth.
Some studies have also suggested that the quantity of
aspirated bacteria is more important than the type (39).

The number of teeth present and the degree to which
the tooth surfaces and periodontal tissue have been
compromised are important components in assessing
the factors associated with respiratory infection. Teeth
with caries constitute reservoirs for cariogenic organisms
such as Streptococcus sobrinus, which has been shown to
be associated with aspiration pneumonia in hospitalized
functionally dependent individuals (38). In addition to its
cariogenic potential, S. sobrinus seems to be associated
with xerostomia, which is another contributing element
to the incidence of pneumonia (40).

It is known that the oral microbiota of individuals with
teeth is very different from that of individuals without
teeth. Although, on the one hand, there is a lower
prevalence of anaerobic bacteria in the absence of teeth
and greater concentration of lactobacilli and fungi (41),
it needs to be emphasized that the use of poorly cleaned
prostheses, especially by dependent elderly results in
a reservoir for respiratory pathogens. When such patho-
gens are aspirated, they may cause unexpected infections
(42, 43).

The severity of periodontal disease seems to have a
dose-response effect, although there is a scarcity of
studies demonstrating this relationship. Notwithstanding,
Scannapieco and Ho (44) and Hayes et al. (45) found a
tendency toward diminished pulmonary function with
increasing clinical attachment loss. In a retrospective
longitudinal study, Awano et al. (46) demonstrated that
individuals with at least 10 teeth and periodontal pockets
greater than 4 mm presented with a higher incidence of
mortality due to pneumonia than did those without any
teeth with periodontal pockets, indicating that the greater
the number of periodontally compromised teeth and,
consequently, the greater the quantity of oral bacteria, the
greater the risk of mortality due to pneumonia. In the
light of similar evidence, Ba´gyi et al. (33) suggested that
evaluation of
the periodontal condition could be a
method for identifying individuals who were at high
risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia.

Another point

in this context

is the relationship
between an individual’s length of hospital stay and their
salivary flow. It is known that salivary secretion has
a significant role in maintaining oral health and that its
suppression or diminution leads to difficulty in swallow-
ing and increases the risk of developing opportunistic
infections. Amerongem et al. (47) stated that the presence
of certain immunoglobulins and antimicrobial enzymes in
saliva such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, and lactoperoxidase
is of fundamental
importance in maintaining health.

Respiratory disease and oral bacteria

Sedating patients in intensive care centers and the length
of their hospital stay interferes with salivary secretion and
promotes changes in the oral microbiota in a matter of a
few weeks. This favors the growth of Gram-negative
bacteria and consequently increases the risk of aspiration
of these pathogens (16, 17).

Increased colonization of

the dental biofilm by
respiratory bacteria in individuals exposed to antibiotics
has also been shown (48). However,
it needs to be
emphasized that because the inability of antibiotics to
penetrate the dental biofilm subgingival infection may
persist after antibiotic therapy. Thus, mechanical cleaning
and disruption of

the biofilm are still essential

Further,

it is recognized that ventilation equipment
often becomes contaminated with the patient’s own
bacteria such that the use of such equipment may represent
a significant risk factor in the etiology of nosocomial
pneumonia.

It has been increasingly observed that the use of
toothbrushes as a means of removing dental plaque
among hospitalized individuals is more efficient than
the use of foam swabs, especially when used at an
appropriate frequency (50, 51). Abe et al. (52) observed
that elderly people who received professional oral hygiene
care presented lower prevalence of respiratory pathogens
such as Candida albicans than did individuals who did
not receive such oral care. In another prospective study, it
was noted that the mortality rate due to aspiration
pneumonia was lower among elderly people who had
been included in an oral care program than among those
who had not participated in the program (53).

Behavioral aspects of inappropriate oral hygiene such
as the brushing method adopted,
lack of knowledge
regarding oral care, and irregular visits to the dentist for
supragingival scaling have all been shown to be associated
with occurrences of chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (54), thus emphasizing the importance of oral care.
In a meta-analysis conducted in 2003, Scannapieco
et al. (55) concluded that antimicrobial agents such as
chlorhexidine have an effect in reducing the risk of
respiratory infections. Good oral hygiene seems to dimin-
ish the levels of enzymes that degrade fibronectin, which
originate in the dental biofilm or polymorphonuclear
leukocytes found in saliva (23, 56). Chlorhexidine, which
is widely used for inhibiting the formation of the dental
biofilm and controlling gingivitis and oral ulceration,
leads to changes in bacterial retention and growth thereby
resulting in reductions in bacterial colonization on teeth.
In this context, DeRiso et al. (57) tested oropharyngeal
decontamination using 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate
in patients who would be undergoing surgical procedures.
They obtained a reduction in the nosocomial infection
rate of 65%. More recently, Munro et al. (58) examined
the effects of brushing, the use of chlorhexidine, and a

combination of both on the development of pneumonia
associated with mechanical ventilation in 547 hospita-
lized patients. Their results showed that independent of
brushing and 0.12% chlorhexidine reduced the incidence
of pneumonia on the third day among individuals with-
out infection at the baseline. In another clinical trial,
Scannapieco et al. (59) showed that topical application of
chlorhexidine once or twice a day was effective against
S. aureus in the dental biofilm of individuals undergoing
mechanical ventilation, but that it did not significantly
reduce the frequency of Gram-negative pathogens. How-
ever, these authors attributed this lack of association to
the greater sensitivity of S. aureus to chlorhexidine and to
the small sample size of their study.

Alcohol intake also seems to be related to a higher
frequency of pneumonias. Alcohol adversely affects the
respiratory and immune systems, alters the mechanism of
respiratory clearance (depression of the glottic reflexes:
glottis, cough, and ciliary action), and in excess increases
the risk of altered consciousness, convulsions, and vomit-
ing with aspiration. Smoking has also been reported to be
a residual confounding factor in studies of associations
between oral conditions and respiratory infections, given
that this compromises the mucociliary barrier and pha-
gocyte activity. Some studies have shown that the worse
the periodontal condition, the greater the risk of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease among smokers (54, 60).

In general, however, relatively few randomized con-
trolled clinical trials have investigated the association
between oral health and respiratory disease. In any such
studies, it is extremely important to define the type of
respiratory disease as well as the specific diagnostic
criteria used for both the exposure measurement (period-
ontitis) and outcome measurement (respiratory infection).
In terms of periodontal disease, measurements such as
the probing depths, bleeding on probing, clinical attach-
ment levels, and alveolar bone levels are generally used.
However, these measurements are surrogates that do not
reflect the current disease activity. Beck and Offenbacher
(61) suggested that the ideal would be to use a measure-
ment that would portray both exposure and bacterial
activity as well as levels of acute-phase inflammatory or
reactive mediators.

Although bacteria are necessary for respiratory infec-
tion, they are insufficient alone to cause disease. Other
factors such as the degree of neurological control over
deglutition and respiration and smoking are involved and
need to be taken into consideration.

In summary, it seems that there is still a significant
knowledge gap regarding the association between poor
oral health and pneumonia. This lack of evidence has
made it difficult to carry out more elaborate intervention
studies. Additional studies evaluating the role of the
bacterial load in the oral cavity and the effectiveness of

treatment

topical
infections are needed.

for preventing hospital respiratory

Conclusion
So far there is no consensus regarding the hypothesis that
oral bacteria might contribute to the etiology of respira-
tory diseases. Nevertheless, a number of theories have
been put forward. These can be summarized as follows:

1. Oral bacteria that colonize the oropharynx may be
aspirated through the lower respiratory tract, parti-
cularly in individuals at high risk of infection such as
hospitalized patients.

2. Salivary enzymes associated with periodontal dis-
ease may modify the mucosal surfaces along the
respiratory tract, thus facilitating colonization by
pathogens.

3. Hydrolytic enzymes as a result of periodontal
disease may destroy salivary films and consequently
make bacteria elimination difficult, thus promoting
the possibility of aspiration of these pathogens into
the lungs.

4. Inflammatory molecules and peripheral mono-
nuclear cells present in saliva may modify the res-
piratory epithelium and promote colonization by
respiratory pathogens.

Although the association is not fully established and the
biological mechanisms not yet fully understood,
it is
important to realize that oral diseases are preventable
and protocols should be developed to prevent even the
possibility of such an association. The history of health
sciences presents episodes such as the classic example of
puerperal fever,
in which the problem was not fully
understood nor a biological basis established, but where
control or even preventive measures were adopted on a
population-wide basis.

Conflict of interest and funding
The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest
relating to this study.
