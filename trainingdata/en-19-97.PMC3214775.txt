ABSTRACT

Neurite  outgrowth  and  its  maintenance  are  essential  aspects  of  neuronal  cells  for 
their  connectivity  and  communication  with  other  neurons.  Recent  studies  showed  that 
over-expression  of  either  leucine-rich  repeat  kinase  2  (LRRK2),  whose  mutations  are 
associated  with  familial  Parkinson's  disease  (PD),  or  Rab5b,  an  early  endosomal 
marker  protein,  induces  reduction  in  neurite  length.  Based  on  our  recent  findings  that 
LRRK2  co-localizes  and  interacts  with  Rab5,  we  tested  the  hypothesis  that  LRRK2  and 
Rab5  may  functionally  interplay  while  controlling  neurite  outgrowth.  Firstly,  we  con-
firmed  previous  reports  that  over-expression  of  either  the  LRRK2  PD-specific  G2019S 
mutant  or  the  Rab5  constitutively  active  Q79L  mutant,  but  not  of  dominant  negative 
N133I  mutant,  significantly  reduces  neurite  outgrowth.  Secondly,  when  over-expression 
of  either  LRRK2  wild  type  (WT)  or  G2019S  was  accompanied  with  over-expression  of 
one  of  the  Rab5  variants  (WT,  Q79L  and  N133I),  or  with  down-regulation  of  Rab5,  the 
reduction  extent  of  its  neurite  length  was  similar  to  that  of  cells  over-expressing  LRRK2 
alone,  regardless  of  Rab5’s  status.  Finally,  we  observed  similar  patterns  of  neurite 
length  regulation  in  embryonic  rat  hippocampal  neuron  cultures.  Taken  together,  our 
results  suggest  that  LRRK2  and  Rab5  functionally  coordinate  their  regulation  of  neurite 
outgrowth  and  that  LRRK2  is  a  more  critical  factor  than  Rab5.

INTRODUCTION

    Leucine-rich  repeat  kinase  2  (LRRK2)  is  a  large 
protein  of  285  kDa  that  is  composed  of  functional 
GTPase  and  kinase  domains  as  well  as  several 
protein-protein  interaction  domains  such  as  WD40 
and  leucine-rich  repeat  (LRR)  (Paisan-Ruiz  et  al., 
2004;  Zimprich  et  al.,  2004;  Gloeckner  et  al.,  2006; 
West  et  al.,  2007).  Missense  mutations  of  LRRK2

have  been  reported  to  cause  Parkinson’s  disease 
(PD),  the  second  most  common  neurodegenerative 
disease,  in  an  autosomal  dominant  manner  (Pai-
san-Ruiz  et  al.,  2004;  Zimprich  et  al.,  2004).  Among 
these  mutations,  G2019S  is  the  most  prevalent 
mutation  that  exhibits  kinase  activity  stronger  than 
that  of  the  wild  type  (West  et  al.,  2005;  Jaleel  et 
al.,  2007;  Luzon-Toro  et  al.,  2007;  West  et  al., 
2007;  Gandhi  et  al.,  2009)  and  R1441C  may 
disrupt  LRRK2’s  homodimerization  (Deng  et  al., 
2008;  Gandhi  et  al.,  2008;  Klein  et  al.,  2009).  Since 
G2019S  has  been 
familial  and 
sporadic  cases  of  PD  (Gilks  et  al.,  2005;  Lesage  et 
al.,  2007),  elucidation  of  the  normal  and  pathogenic

functions  of  LRRK2  will  be  critical  for  our  under-
standing  of  the  etiology  of  PD. 
    LRRK2  has  been  proposed  to  cause  increase  of 
protein  aggregation  and  neuronal  toxicity  (Smith  et 
al.,  2005;  Greggio  et  al.,  2006;  Smith  et  al.,  2006; 
West  et  al.,  2007;  Heo  et  al.,  2010),  shortening  of 
neurite  length  in  primary  neuron  cultures  (MacLeod 
et  al.,  2006;  Plowey  et  al.,  2008)  and  regulation  of 
endocytosis  rate  (Shin  et  al.,  2008).  In  addition, 
LRRK2  has  been  reported  to  interact  with  multiple 
cellular  proteins  including  Rab5b  (Shin  et  al.,  2008), 
parkin  (Smith  et  al.,  2005),  α/β-tubulin  hetero-
dimers  (Gandhi  et  al.,  2008),  FADD  [Fas-associated 
protein  with  death  domain,  (Ho  et  al.,  2009)],  heat 
shock  protein  90  [Hsp90,  (Wang  et  al.,  2008)],  the 
dishevelled  family  members  [DVL1-3,  (Sancho  et 
al.,  2009)]  and  others  (Dachsel  et  al.,  2007). 
Among  these,  Rab5b  is  an  isoform  of  Rab5,  which 
is  a  member  of  the  Rab  family,  a  small  GTPase 
family.  Rab5  is  present  in  early  endosomes  and 
regulates  endocytosis  by  controlling  endosome  fu-
sion  and  motility  (Gorvel  et  al.,  1991;  Stenmark  et 
al.,  1994).  In  addition,  Rab5  is  known  to  be  lo-
calized  in  presynaptic  vesicles  (de  Hoop  et  al., 
1994;  Shin  et  al.,  2008)  and  affects  endocytosis 
rates  (Wucherpfennig  et  al.,  2003;  Shin  et  al., 
2008).  Rab5  has  been  reported  to  negatively  re-
gulate  neurite  outgrowth  in  rat  pheochromocytoma 
PC12  cells  treated  with  nerve  growth  factor  [NGF, 
(Liu  et  al.,  2007)].  Over-expression  of  Rab5  wild 
type  (WT)  or  of  the  constitutively  active  GTPase 
mutant,  Q79L,  inhibited  neurite  outgrowth  whereas 
over-expression  of  the  dominant  negative  GTPase 
mutant,  N133I,  enhanced  neurite  development  (Liu 
et  al.,  2007).  Recently,  Rab5  has  been  reported  to 
regulate  caspase-8-mediated  cell  motility  (Torres  et 
al.,  2010)  and  to  spatially  control  branching  within 
dendritic  arbors  (Satoh  et  al.,  2008). 
    Based  on  our  previously  finding  that  LRRK2  in-
teracts  with  Rab5b  and  that  this  interaction  re-
gulates  endocytosis  of  synaptic  vesicles  (Shin  et  al., 
2008),  we  investigated  here  whether  this  interaction 
also  affected  each  partner’s  ability  to  regulate  neu-
rite  outgrowth  using  PC12  cells  treated  with  NGF 
as  well  as  primary  hippocampal  neuronal  cultures. 
Our  results  suggest  that  LRRK2  is  a  more  critical 
factor  than  Rab5  in  regulating  neurite  outgrowth 
although  both  proteins  functionally  coordinate  re-

gulation  of  neurite  outgrowth.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Plasmids  and  other  reagents

    cDNAs  of  wild  type  and  mutants  of  LRRK2  and 
Rab5b  were  cloned  into  modified  pcDNA3.1  plas-
mids  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA)  with  Myc  and  Flag 
tags,  respectively  (Shin  et  al.,  2008).  The  shLRRK2 
plasmids  containing  LRRK2  specific  sequences  (5' 
CTGATCCAGTTAAAGAATATGGTTGTGCC  3')  were 
purchased  ORIGENE  (Rockville,  Maryland).  The 
sequences  of  siRNAs  for  Rab5b  are  5'  AGGCAU-
AUGCAGAUGACAA  3'  (Rab5  siRNA-1)  and  5'  GCA-
CGAAAGCUAAGACAUA  3'  (Rab5  siRNA-2).  Since 
both  Rab5  siRNAs  showed  similar  neurite  lengths, 
we  used  only  siRab5-1  (data  not  shown).  Con-
struction  of  plasmids  containing  each  gene 
for 
LRRK2  G2019S,  R1441C  and  Rab5  Q79L,  N133I 
were  previously  reported  (Shin  et  al.,  2008). 

Cell  culture,  transient  transfection  and  western 
analysis

    PC12  or  rat  primary  hippocampal  neuron  cells 
were  cultured  in  RPMI  1640  medium  containing 
10%  heat-inactivated  fetal  bovine  serum,  5%  horse 
serum  and  1%  antibiotics  or  Neurobasal  medium 
(Invitrogen,  cat  no.  21103-049),  respectively.  To 
induce  neurite  outgrowth,  PC12  cells  were  seeded 
at  a  density  of  40%  on  the  cover  glass  and  treated 
with  nerve  growth  factor  (NGF,  Invitrogen,)  at  50 
ng/ml  for  7  days  with  replenishment  of  NGF  every 
two  days.  For  primary  neuronal  culture,  rat  E17 
primary  dissociated  hippocampal  neurons  were  pre-
pared  and  cultured  as  previously  described  (Shin  et 
al.,  2008).  The  indicated  plasmids  and/or  siRNAs 
were  transiently  transfected  by  Lipofectamine  2000 
(Invitrogen)  at  the  third  day  of  NGF  treatment  for 
PC12  cells  or  at  the  fifth  day  after  seeding  of 
primary  neuronal  cells.  The  amounts  of  plasmids  for 
transfections  were  as  follows:  4μg  for  transfection 
of  LRRK2  or  shLRRK2  plasmids,  2μg  for  trans-
fection  of  Rab5  plasmids,  4  and  1μg  for  co- 
transfection  of  LRRK2  or  shLRRK2  and  Rab5 
plasmids,  respectively,  or  100  nM  for  all  siRNAs.  If 
necessary,  the  amounts  of  plasmid  DNAs  were  kept 
constant  at  5μg  by  addition  of  vector  plasmids. 
Cells  were 
for  microscopic  analysis  after 

fixed 

incubation  for  7  more  days.
    To  test  protein  expression  level,  PC12  cells  were 
transiently  co-transfected  with  the  indicated  plas-

mids  and  pMACS4.1  expressing  CD4∆  (Miltenyi 

Biotec,  Bergisch  Gladbach,  Germany)  and  har-
vested  after  2∼3  days  of  incubation.  Co-transfected 
cells  were  sorted  by  MACS  (Magnetic-activated  cell 
sorting,  Miltenyi  Biotec,  Bergisch  Gladbach,  Ger-
many).  MACS  utilizes  CD4  antibodies  coupled  to 
micromagnetic  beads  which  specifically  detect  CD4

∆  expressed  on  the  surface  of  transfected  cells.  A 

magnetic  field  was  applied  to  sort  cells  bound  to 
the  CD4  antibodies  with  magnetic  beads.  The 
protein  expression  level  was  determined  by  im-
munoblotting  of  each  cell  lysates.

Immunofluorescence  staining

    To  identify  transfected  cells  with  LRRK2  and/or 
Rab5,  cells  were  stained  with  antibodies  against  the 
corresponding  proteins  or  their  specific  fusion  tags. 
To  detect  over-expression  of  LRRK2  or  Rab5,  anti- 
myc  (Sigma,  cat  no.  M5546)  or  anti-flag  (Sigma,  cat 
no.  F3165)  antibodies  were  used,  respectively.  To 
detect  cells  transfected  with  shLRRK2  plasmids  or 
Rab5  siRNAs,  anti-LRRK2  (Norvus,  cat  no.  300- 
268)  or  anti-Rab5  (Santa  Cruz,  cat  no.  sc-598) 
antibodies  were  used,  respectively,  and  cells  ex-
pressing  the  corresponding  proteins  at  low  level  in 
comparison  to  neighboring  cells  were  selected  for 
neurite  analysis  (Fig.  1).  In  addition,  to  identify  cells 
transfected  with  siRNAs,  shDNA  or  vector  plasmids 
alone,  GFP  plasmids  were  co-transfected  and  GFP 
antibodies  (a  gift  from  Dr.  Eunjoon  Kim  of  KAIST, 
Korea)  were  used  for  their  detection.  Alexa  488 
goat  anti-mouse 
IgG  (Molecular  Probe,  cat  no. 
A11001)  or  Alexa  555  goat  anti-rabbit  IgG  (Mo-
lecular  probe,  cat  no.  A21422)  were  used  as  se-
condary  antibodies  to  visualize  positive  cells.

Assay  for  neurite  outgrowth

    To  analyze  neurite  outgrowth  patterns, 
trans-
fected  and  immunostained  cells  for  all  samples 
were  observed  under  a  fluorescence  microscope 
(Olympus  model  BX61)  set  up  under  the  same 
condition.  Five  fields  on  the  coverglass  were  ran-
domly  selected  and  their  images  taken.  Then,  every 
cell  in  the  images  satisfying  the  experimental  con-
ditions  such  as  over-  or  down-expression  of  specific

total  and 

proteins  was  selected  for  further  neurite  analysis. 
The  number  of  cells  analyzed  was  in  the  range  of 
400∼1,800.  The  selected  cells’ 
the 
longest  neurite 
lengths  were  analyzed  using  a 
computer-assisted  image  analysis  program  [Meta-
Morph  software  Program,  Molecular  Devices,  Down-
ingtown,  PA,  USA  (Klimaschewski  et  al.,  2002)]. 
Values  for  each  cell’s  total  and  the  longest  neurite 
lengths  were  divided  by  its  cell  body  diameter  to 
compensate  differences  of  their  soma  sizes  since 
cells  with  larger  cell  bodies  generally  contain  longer 
neurites.  From  these  values,  the  average  and  the 
standard  error  of  the  mean  (SEM)  for  each  ex-
perimental  condition  were  calculated  and  shown  as 
relative  values  to  the  vector  control.  Since  the  data 
pattern  of  the  total  and  the  longest  neurite  lengths 
were  very  similar  to  each  other,  only  the  pattern  of 
the  total  neurite  length  is  shown. 

RESULTS

    To  address  whether  LRRK2  and  Rab5  coordi-
nately 
regulate  neurite  outgrowth,  we  cultured 
NGF-treated  PC12  cells  with  a  combination  con-
sisting  of  over-  or  down-expression  of  LRRK2 
and/or  Rab5.  The  resulting  cells  were  analyzed  by 
immunofluorescence  using  anti-LRRK2  and/or  anti- 
Rab5  antibodies.  When  necessary,  anti-GFP  or 
other  specific  antibody  was  used  to  identify  trans-
fected  cells.  A  representative  immunostaining  pat-
tern  for  each  condition  is  shown  in  Fig.  1  and 
quantitative  analyses  of  neurite  lengths  of  trans-
fected  cells  are  shown  in  Fig.  2.  We  assessed 
neurite  outgrowth  according  to  two  factors,  total 
lengths  of  neurites  and  the  longest  neurite  length  of 
each  counted  cell  using  MetaMorph,  a  compu-
ter-assisted  program.  Analyses  using 
two 
factors  revealed  that  both  neurite  length  patterns 
were  similar  to  each  other.  Therefore,  we  showed 
only  total  neurite  length  pattern  (Fig.  2).
    We  observed  that  PC12  cells  over-expressing  the 
LRRK2  pathogenic  mutant,  G2019S,  had  drama-
length  while  PC12  cells 
tically  reduced  neurite 
over-expressing 
type  LRRK2  modestly 
reduced  neurite  length  (Fig.  1A  &  2  lanes  1∼3). 
When  over-expressed,  another  pathogenic  mutant 
R1441C  exhibited  neurite  length  between  those  of 
WT  and  G2019S  (Fig.  1A  &  2  lanes  1∼4).  As

shLRRK2  with  flag  tagged  Rab5  plasmids  (d).  PC12  cells  were  seeded  on  coverglass  and  treated  with  NGF  (50  ng/ml)  for  10  days.  Cells 
were  transfected  with  the  indicated  plasmid  on  the  third  day  and  fixed  on  the  10th  day  for  microscopic  analysis.  Total  amounts  of  DNA 
used  were  kept  constant  by  addition  of  vector  plasmids  for  all  samples.  For  each  case,  nuclear  staining  was  shown  by  Hoechst  staining 
and  proteins  of  interest  were  stained  by  the  antibody  against  the  tag  (over-expression)  or  protein  itself  (down-expression).  To  identify  cells 
down-expressing  LRRK2  or  Rab5,  cells  weakly  stained  by  specific  antibodies  relative  to  adjacent  cells  were  selected  and  used  for 
analysis  of  neurite  length  (indicated  by  arrows).  GFP  plasmids  were  used  to  visualize  neurites,  if  needed.  The  scale  bar  is  20μm.  (C)

siRNA-1s  (siRab5)  and  harvested  for  3  or  2  days  for  LRRK2  or  Rab5  analysis,  respectively.  The  weak  expression  of  LRRK2  and  low 
transfection  efficiency  of  the  PC  12  cell  line  made  it  impossible  to  directly  detect  LRRK2  expression  in  western  analysis.  Therefore,  the 
MACS  (Miltenyi  Biotec,  Bergisch  Gladbach,  Germany)  method  was  applied  to  sort  positively  transfected  cells.  PC12  cells  transiently

results  corroborate  previous  studies  performed  with 

rat  primary  cultures  (MacLeod  et  al.,  2006)  and 
human  neuroblastoma  SH-SY5Y  cells  (Plowey  et 
al.,  2008).  In  addition,  our  results  showed  that 
over-expression  of  Rab5  strongly  inhibits  neurite

Fig.  2.  Analysis  of  the  neurite  lengths  of  PC12  cells  transfected 
with  the  indicated  plasmids  and/or  siRNAs.  Cells  were  trans-
fected  and  treated  as  explained  in  Fig.  1.  Cells  in  five  randomly 
selected  fields  were  analyzed.  Whether  cells  were  transfected 
with  the  indicated  plasmids  and/or  siRNAs  was  confirmed  by  the 
expression  pattern  of  the  proteins  after  staining  with  specific 
antibodies.  Cells  clearly  showing  over-  or  down-expression  of 
corresponding  proteins  were  selected.  Every  selected  cell  was 
subjected  to  neurite  length  analysis  that  was  carried  out  using  an 
automated  image  analysis  program  (MetaMorph  Program,  Mo-
lecular  Devices,  Downingtown,  PA,  USA)  with  the  same  para-
meter  set  for  all  samples.  The  resulting  total  neurite  length  of 
each  cell  is  shown  as  average  with  standard  error  of  mean 
(SEM).  The  Y  axis  is  arbitrally  set  as  1  for  the  neurite  length  of 
cells  transfected  with  vector  plasmids.  G/S  and  R/C  indicate 
LRRK2  G2019S  and  R1441C  mutants,  respectively.  N.S.  means

outgrowth,  in  agreement  with  a  previous  study  [Fig. 
1B  &  2,  (Liu  et  al.,  2007)].  Our  side-by-side  com-
parison  showed  that  the  inhibitory  effect  by  Rab5 
was  much  greater  than  that  by  LRRK2  wild  type 
(WT)  and  was  similar  to  that  by  G2019S  (Fig.  1  & 
2).  In  addition,  Rab5  siRNA  showed  little  difference 
from  the  vector  control  in  neurite  length  (Fig.  2 
lanes  1  &  7).
    Notably,  when  both  of  LRRK2  and  Rab5  were 
over-expressed,  they  exhibited  neither  additional  nor 
synergistic  effect  on  neurite  length.  Instead,  the 
extent  of  reduction  in  neurite  lengths  was  similar  to 
that  by  LRRK2  over-expression  alone  (Fig.  2  lanes 
2  vs  8).  This  finding  suggests  that  these  two 
proteins  functionally  interact  and  co-regulate  neurite 
outgrowth,  which 
further  supported  by  co-lo-
calization  of  these  over-expressed  proteins  in  both 
cell  body  and  neurites  [Fig.  1Bb,  (Shin  et  al., 
2008)].  Next  we  tested  the  effect  of  over-expressing 
one  protein  while  knocking  down  expression  of  the 
other.  Toward  this,  we  used  Rab5  siRNA-1  (siRab5) 

is

dition  is  shown  as  an  average  with  SEM.  All  procedures  were

and  shLRRK2  plasmid,  a  plasmid  containing  a 
short-hairpin  RNA  (shRNA)  sequence  against  LRRK2 
(ORIGENE),  to  down-regulate  Rab5  and  LRRK2, 
respectively.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1C,  these  methods 
efficiently  knock-down  the  expression  of  the  cor-
responding  proteins  in  PC12  cells.  As  control,  we 
confirmed  that  either  GFP  siRNA  or  shGFP  plasmid 
did  not  detectably  affect  neurite  outgrowth  by  im-
munoflulorescence  staining  and  computer  analysis 
(Fig.  3  and  data  not  shown).  Cells  transfected  with 
either  mixture  of  myc-LRRK2  plasmids  and  Rab5 
siRNAs  or  mixture  of 
flag-Rab5  and  shLRRK2 
plasmids,  were  identified  by  staining  with  antibodies 
against  myc  and  Rab5,  or  LRRK2  and 
flag, 
respectively  (Fig.  1Bc  &  1Bd).  Cells  exhibiting 
over-expression  of  one  protein  and  simultaneously 
reduced  expression  of 
the  other  protein  were 
selected  and  analyzed  for  neurite  lengths.  Cells 
over-expressing  LRRK2  with  down-expression  of 
Rab5  showed  no  significant  differences  from  cells 
over-expressing  both  LRRK2  and  Rab5  in  terms  of 
neurite  length  (Fig.  1B  and  Fig.  2  lanes  8  vs  9).  In 
contrast,  cells  over-expressing  Rab5  with  down-ex-
pression  of  LRRK2  showed  neurite  length  shorter 
than  cells  down-expressing  LRRK2  alone  and  much 
longer  than  the  cells  over-expressing  Rab5  alone 
(Fig.  1  and  Fig.  2  lanes  5,  6  &  10).  Taken  together, 
our  results  indicate  that  LRRK2  expression  level 
more  critically  determines  neurite  length  than  the 
Rab5  expression  level.

the  neurite 

    Rab5  is  a  member  of  a  small  GTPase  family 
recycling  between  active  GTP-  and  inactive  GDP- 
bound  forms.  The  active  Rab5  negatively  regulates 
neurite  outgrowth  (Liu  et  al.,  2007).  To  investigate 
how  the  active  or  inactive  status  of  Rab5  affects 
neurite  outgrowth  regulated  by  LRRK2,  we  utilized 
the  Rab5b’s  constitutively  active  Q79L  and  the  do-
minant  negative  N133I  proteins  and  performed  an 
extensive  analysis  (Fig.  3).  In  agreement  with  the 
previous  study,  in  NGF-treated  PC12  cell,  over- 
expression  of  Q79L  and  N133I  proteins  showed 
reduction  and  extension  of  the  neurite  outgrowth, 
respectively  [Fig.  3,  lanes  3  &  4  (Liu  et  al.,  2007)], 
although 
length  differences  among 
samples  in  this  particular  set  were  smaller  than  the 
one  observed  in  Fig.  2  (Compare  lanes  1,  6  &  8  in 
Fig.  2  to  lanes  1,  2  &  7  in  Fig.  3).  It  is  interesting 
that  Rab5  siRNAs  showed  neurite  length  similar  to 
that  of  the  vector  control  or  the  siGFP  control 
whereas  cells  expressing  Rab5  N133I  considerably 
extended  their  neurite  lengths  (Fig.  3,  lanes  1,  4,  5 
&  6).  This  may  indicate  that  the  active  status,  but 
not  the  concentration,  of  Rab5  is  critical  for  re-
gulation  of  neurite  outgrowth.
    When  either  LRRK2  WT  or  G2019S  was  co-ex-
pressed  with  one  of  Rab5  WT,  constitutively  active 
and  dominant  negative  forms,  their  neurite  lengths 
were  similar  to  those  of  cells  expressing  either 
LRRK2  WT  or  G2019S  protein  alone,  respectively, 
regardless  of  which  form  of  Rab5  was  co-expressed 
(Fig.  3,  lane  2∼4  vs  lanes  7∼9  &  12∼14).  This 
was  also  the  case  when  siRab5  was  used  instead 
of  over-expression  of  Rab5  (Fig.  3,  lane  5,  6  vs 
lanes  10,  11  &  15,  16).  This  is  striking  in  that 
LRRK2  can  disable  Rab5’s  active  signal  to  regulate 
neurite  outgrowth.  In  contrast,  cells  down-regulating 
LRRK2  while  over-expressing  Rab5  WT  or  Q79L 
exhibited  neurite  length  of  each  sample  in  the 
middle  between  the  one  observed  under  down- 
regulation  of  LRRK2  alone  and  the  one  seen  with 
over-expressing  the  corresponding  Rab5  alone  (Fig. 
3,  lanes  2,  3  vs  lanes  17,  18).  Down-regulation  of 
LRRK2  with  Rab5  N133I  over-expression  resulted 
in  shorter  neurite  length  than  down-regulation  of 
LRRK2  alone  and  over-expression  of  Rab5  N133I 
alone,  both  of  which  showed  considerable  extension 
of  neurite  (Fig.  3,  lanes  4,  20  &  21  and  Fig.  2,  lane 
5).  No  additional  or  synergistic  effect  by  combi-

nation  of  down-regulation  of  LRRK2  with  Rab5 
N133I  over-expression  was  observed,  suggesting 
again  co-regulation  of  neurite  outgrowth  by  LRRK2 
and  Rab5.  It  is  not  clear  why  cells  down-expressing 
LRRK2  with  Rab5  N133I  over-expression  showed 
no  difference  from  vector  control  instead  of  ex-
tension  in  neurite  length.  The  result  in  Fig.  3 
strongly  suggests  that  both  cellular  concentration 
and  kinase  activity  of  LRRK2  are  important  for 
negative  neurite  outgrowth  co-regulated  by  Rab5. 
    Furthermore,  we  carried  out  a  similar  set  of 
functional  analyses  using  hippocampal  E17  pri-
mary  neuronal  cells  over-expressing  LRRK2  with 
over-  or  down-expression  of  Rab5  and  found  similar 
patterns  of  neurite  outgrowth  regulation  as  those  in 
PC12  cells  (Fig.  2  &  4).  Specifically,  neither  over- 
nor  down-expression  of  Rab5  showed  any  differ-
ence  in  neurite  length  as  long  as  LRRK2  was 
co-expressed  (Fig.  4  lanes  5  &  6).  However,  the 
over-expression  of  LRRK2  with  over-  or  down-ex-
pression  of  Rab5 
in  primary  neuronal  cultures 
resulted  in  relatively  shorter  neurites  than  over-ex-
pression  of  LRRK2  alone  (Fig.  4  lanes  2,  5  &  6) 
whereas  the  same  sets  in  PC12  cells  resulted  in 
neurites  similar  to  or  slightly  longer  than  that  when 
LRRK2  alone  was  over-expressed  (Fig.  2  &  3).  It 
may  be  due  to  differences  of  cell  types  used  or  of 

protocols  to  induce  neurite  outgrowth.  However,  the 
results  here  strongly  suggested  that,  as  long  as 
LRRK2  was  over-expressed,  the  identity  or  cellular 
concentration  of  Rab5  was  not  critical  to  regulate 
neurite  outgrowth. 
    Taken  together,  our  results  suggest  that  LRRK2 
and  Rab5  co-regulate  neurite  outgrowth  and  LRRK2 
is  a  more  critical  factor  than  Rab5  to  determine  the 
neurite  length.

DISCUSSION

    In  this  study,  we  confirmed  previous  findings  that 
LRRK2,  especially  LRRK2  G2019S,  and  Rab5  ne-
gatively  regulate  neurite  outgrowth  (MacLeod  et  al., 
2006;  Liu  et  al.,  2007;  Plowey  et  al.,  2008).  Our 
data  also  showed  that  LRRK2  WT  decrease  neurite 
length  although  the  effect  is  less  prominent  than 
that  of  G2019S.  LRRK2  WT’s  effect  on  neurite 
length  was  ill  defined  in  previous  reports  (MacLeod 
et  al.,  2006;  Plowey  et  al.,  2008).  In  addition,  there 
is  also  a  report  that  LRRK2  WT  transgenic  mice 
exhibited  no  difference  in  neurite  length  from  that  of 
non-transgenic  control  mice  (Parisiadou  et  al.,  2009). 
It  might  be  due  to  difference  of  cell  lines  used  in 
each  study. 
    In  this  report,  we  provide  several  lines  of  evi-
dence  suggesting  that  Rab5  and  LRRK2  co-re-
gulate  neurite  outgrowth  and  that  LRRK2  is  a  more 
critical  factor  than  Rab5.  Firstly,  over-expression  of 
both  proteins  clearly  showed  no  additional  or  sy-
nergistic  effect  (Fig.  2∼4).  While  Rab5  either  WT 
or  Q79L  over-expression  shortened  neurites  signi-
ficantly  greater  than  LRRK2  WT,  co-expression  of 
Rab5  with  LRRK2  WT  proteins  reduced  neurite 
lengths  similar  to  those  observed  with  LRRK2  alone 
(Fig.  2  &  3).  In  fact,  co-expression  of  LRRK2  WT  or 
G2019S  with  one  of  the  Rab5  (WT,  Q79L  and 
N133I)  exhibited  a  pattern  of  neurite  length  similar 
to  the  one  observed  with  LRRK2  WT  or  G2019S 
expression  alone  regardless  of  Rab5’s  identity  (Fig. 
3).  This  was  more  striking  when  compared  with 
co-expression  of  LRRK2  WT  or  G2019S  with  Rab5 
N133I  to  Rab5  N133I  over-expression  alone.  The 
cells  co-expressing  LRRK2  WT  or  G2019S  with 
Rab5  N133I  reduced  neurite  length  to  the  level  of 
the  corresponding  LRRK2  over-expression  alone 
whereas 
the  cells  over-expressing  Rab5  N133I

alone  considerably  extended  neurite  lengths  (Fig. 
3).  Secondly,  down-expression  of  Rab5  using  Rab5 
siRNA  did  not  affect  neurite  lengths  (Fig.  2  &  3). 
Thirdly,  down-regulation  of  LRRK2  expression  with 
over-expression  of  Rab5  overrided  the  over-expres-
sion  effect  of  Rab5  WT  or  of  its  constitutively  active 
Q79L,  resulting  in  longer  neurites  compared  to 
over-expression  of  corresponding  Rab5  alone,  but 
shorter  than  down-regulation  of  LRRK2  alone  (Fig. 
2  &  3).  This  suggested  that  when  cellular  LRRK2 
concentration  was  low,  Rab5  could  partially  function 
as  a  regulator  of  neurite  outgrowth.  Taken  together, 
our  results  suggest  that  regulation  of  neurite  out-
growth  via  LRRK2  and  Rab5  is  not  effected  in-
dependently,  but  possibly  through  a  shared  me-
chanism.
    Recently,  we  have  reported  that  LRRK2  over- 
expression  decreases  the  endocytosis  rate  of  sy-
naptic  vesicles  (Shin  et  al.,  2008).  Since  LRRK2 
also  inhibits  endocytosis  of  the  NGF  receptor,  TrkA, 
which  is  the  first  step  of  neurite  outgrowth  following 
NGF  treatment,  it  corroborates  the  fact  that  LRRK2 
over-expression  negatively  regulates  neurite  out-
growth.  In  addition,  Rab5  inactivation  appears  to  be 
essential  for  endosomes  containing  TrkA  to  become 
signaling  endosomes  whose  signals  result  in  neurite 
outgrowth  (Liu  et  al.,  2007).  Since  LRRK2  over- 
expression  with  combination  of  different  form  of 
Rab5s  resulted  in  neurite  length  similar  to  that  of 
LRRK2  expression  alone 
regardless  of  either 
cellular  concentration  or  active  status  of  Rab5  (Fig. 
2∼4),  LRRK2  might  function  in  other  steps  fol-
lowing  endocytosis  of  TrkA-containing  vesicles  and 
inhibit  the  negative  effect  of  Rab5.  This  notion  is 
further  supported  by  the  previous  reports  showing 
that 
inhibition  of  neurite  outgrowth,  but  not  of 
endocytosis,  is  dependent  on  the  active  level  of 
LRRK2  kinase  (MacLeod  et  al.,  2006;  Shin  et  al., 
2008). 
the 
LRRK2  G2019S  mutant  ,  expressing  kinase  activity 
stronger  than  that  of  wild  type  induced  shorter 
neurites,  but  no  apparent  difference  in  endocytosis 
rate  compared  to  wild  type  (MacLeod  et  al.,  2006; 
Shin  et  al.,  2008).

transmitter  only  when  it  binds  to  GTP.  The  binding 
of  the  GTPase  protein  to  GTP  or  GDP  is  facilitated 
by  GEF  (guanine  nucleotide-exchange  factors)  or 
GAP  (GTPase  activating  protein),  respectively.  Re-
cently,  homodimerization  of  the  GTPase  protein  has 
been  reported  as  another  mechanism  to  activate 
GTPase  protein  without  GEF  (Gasper  et  al.,  2009). 
In  fact,  both  LRRK2  and  Rab5  contain  an  active 
GTPase  domain  and  homodimerizations  of  both 
Rab5  and  LRRK2  were  reported  (Daitoku  et  al., 
2001;  Deng  et  al.,  2008;  Greggio  et  al.,  2008;  Klein 
et  al.,  2009).  Since  LRRK2  and  Rab5  interact  with 
each  other  (Shin  et  al.,  2008)  it  is  possible  that 
their  interaction  interrupts  signal  transmission  by 
the  GTPase  domain  of  Rab5  but  still  maintains 
LRRK2’s  kinase  activity  that  regulates  neurite  out-
growth.  Another  possibility  is  that  LRRK2  kinase 
phosphorylates  Rab5,  resulting  in  Rab5’s  confor-
mational  change  and  activity.  We  are  actively  pur-
suing  this  possibility.
