Within the vertebrate nervous system, myelination is required for the normal function of neurons by facilitating the rapid 
conduction of action potentials along axons. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells which myelinate axons in the central nervous system. 
Disruption of myelination and remyelination failure can cause human diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Despite the importance 
of myelination, the molecular basis of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination are still poorly understood. To understand 
the molecular mechanisms which regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, novel genes were identified using 
a microarray analysis. The analysis used oligodendrocyte lineage cells isolated from transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorescent 
proteins in the oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Seven genes not previously known to be involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation 
were identified, and their expression during oligodendrocyte development was validated.

INTRODUCTION

The insulation of axons in the vertebrate nervous system by 
myelin is essential for efficient axonal conduction, and is thus 
required for the normal function of neurons. Oligodendrocytes 
are glial cells which myelinate axons in the central nervous system 
(CNS), and are generated from oligodendro-cyte progenitor cells 
(OPCs). In the developing spinal cord, OPCs are generated from 
the pMN precursor domain of the ventral spinal cord. OPCs 
express olig2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (Park 
et al., 2002b; Zhou and Anderson, 2002), and differentiate into

mature oligodendro-cytes after migration into the white matter 
of the spinal cord. The differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the 
myelination of axons is a highly regulated process controlled by 
a number of mechanisms, including extrinsic signaling pathways 
and intrinsic machinery. 
In the CNS, myelination disruption and re-myelination failure 
can cause demyelinating human diseases, such as multiple sclerosis 
(MS). Primary demyelination usually occurs by a direct insult to 
the oligodendrocytes, and secondary demyelination occurs as a 
consequence of primary axonal loss (Emery, 2010). Remyelination 
is the process by which new myelin sheaths are restored to 
demyelinated axons, enabling them to recover lost function. 
Although the vertebrate CNS has a very limited regeneration 
capacity, remyelination generally occurs efficiently. However, 
despite the efficiency of remyelination in experimental models 
and in some clinical diseases, remyelination is often inadequate in

MS, the most common primary demyelinating disease (Franklin, 
2002). In MS, the major cause of primary demyelination is 
inflammatory damage to myelin and oligodendrocytes, but the 
reason for the remyelination failure is largely unknown. 
To understand the molecular mechanisms which control 
oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelina-tion, the RNAs 
expressed by oligodendrocyte lineage cells in culture have been 
profiled using microarray technology (Dugas et al., 2006; Cahoy 
et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009). These studies have revealed 
distinct classes of RNAs that are differentially expressed during 
oligodendrocyte differentiation and have led to the identification 
of new factors such as Gpr17, which encodes a G protein-
coupled receptor that controls the timing of oligodendrocyte 
dif-ferentiation (Chen et al., 2009), and myelin gene regulatory 
factor (Mrf), which encodes a transcrip-tion factor necessary 
for expression of myelin genes (Cahoy et al., 2008). However, 
screening for genes differentially expressed in oligodendrocyte 
lineage cells using cultured oligodendrocyte lineage cells has 
limited potential to isolate genes responsible for oligodendrocyte 
differentiation and myelination because these processes are also 
controlled by extracellular ligands and molecules secreted from 
neurons, such as Jagged, PSA-NCAM, and LINGO-1 (Wang et 
al., 1998; Charles et al., 2000; Mi et al., 2005). Here, a microarray 
screening method was used to isolate genes involved in oligo-
dendrocyte differentiation using oligodendrocyte lineage cells 
sorted from transgenic zebrafish. Oligodendrocyte lineage cells 
expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were 
isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and the gene 
expression profiles of undifferentiated OPCs and differentiated 
oligodendrocytes were compared. Seven genes not previously 
known to be involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation were 
identified, and their expression during oligodendrocyte de-
velopment was validated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Zebrafish embryos used in this study were wild-type AB line, Tg 
(olig2:egfp) (Shin et al., 2003), Tg(sox10:egfp) (Carney et al., 
2006) and raised at 28.5oC in egg water or embryo medium (15 
mM NaCl, 0.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.15 mM 
KH2PO4, 0.05 mM NH2PO4, 0.7 mM NaHCO3, EM). Embryos were 
staged according to days post fertilization (dpf) and mor pho logical 
criteria (Kimmel et al., 1995).

Trichostatin A treatment
Embryos were dechorionated and incubated in EM with histone- 

deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (Tsai et al., 2006) at a concent-
ration of 100 ng/ml.

Cell dissociation for flow cytometry
Embryos were raised until appropriate stage and anesthetized 
with ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methane-sulfonic acid on ice. 
A thousand embryos were chopped into several pieces and 
transferred into 1.5 ml eppendorf tube. Collected samples were 
rinsed with calcium-, magnesium-free Ringers solution for 20 
min, then washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline 
(D-PBS) (GIBCO) three times. Tissue was digested with 100 µl 
of D-PBS con-taining 35 µl of Liberase Blendzyme 3, followed 
by incubation at 29oC for 15 min with occasional mixing. After 
incubation, 1 ml of trypsin (GIBCO) was added and incubated at 
29oC for 15 min until complete dissociation. To inactivate trypsin, 
we added 2 ml of D-PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) and filtered the solution through a cell strainer (BD Falcon) 
to remove undissociated cell clusters. We collected dissociated 
cells by cen-trifugation at 300 g at 4oC for 5 min and rinsed twice 
with D-PBS containing 10% FBS. Dissociated cells were collected 
by centrifugation and resus-pended in PBS containing 1 mM 
EDTA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1% FBS. Cell suspensions 
were separated into GFP+ and GFP- cells by BD FACSAria II 
(Becton Dickinson) performed at room temperature under 
sterile conditions. Isolated GFP+ and GFP- cells were collected in 
D-PBS/10% FBS pre-coated tubes with RNase inhibitor.

RNA extraction
Isolated cells were collected by low-speed cen-trifugation and 
homogenized in TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) subsequently. Total 
RNA extraction was performed as described previously (Peterson 
and Freeman, 2009). Isolated total RNA was cleaned up with 
RNeasy midi kit (Quiagen) and qualified as a microarray target 
samples using Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent) and NanoDrop 
spectrophotometer.

Hybridization of agilent gene chips
1 µg of qualified total RNA was amplified and labeled with Cy3, 
Cy5 dyes. Hybridization was performed with Zebrafish Agilent 
Gene Expression Microarray Chips (Agilent), followed by washing 
step. Hybridized chips were then scanned, nor-malized and 
analyzed.

Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized using ImProm-II reverse transcription 
system (Promega). The quantitative real-time PCR was performed 
using the Lightcycler system (Roche Applied Science) with

the Lightcycler- FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche 
Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Each reaction was performed in a volume of 20 µl with final 
concentration of 1× Lightcycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR 
Green 1, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 µM of each primer and 2 µl of first 
strand cDNA mixture. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out 
for 40 cycles and fluorescence readings were acquired at the end 
of each am-plification cycle at 72oC. Melting curve analysis was 
performed with continuous fluorescence acquisition from 65 to 
95oC at a temperature transition rate of 0.1oC/s to determine the 
amplification specificity. All reactions were performed as technical 
duplicates.

Immunohistochemistry
Embryos were anesthetized until movement had ceased and 
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde over-night. Fixed embryos were 
em bedded in 1.5% agar with 5% sucrose blocks and equilibrated 
by 30% sucrose solution. Frozen blocks were sliced into 10 µm 
sec tions on glass slides using cryostat micro-tome. Sections were 
rinsed with PBS several times and then blocked in 2% bovine se-
rum albumin with sheep serum. Embryos were processed for im-
munohistochemistry, following primary antibodies were used: 
ra bbit anti-Sox10 (1 : 250), rabbit anti-MBP (1 : 100), rabbit anti-
GFP (1 : 500, Abcam) and mouse anti-HuC/D (16A11 1 : 20, 
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For fluorescent detection of 
antibody labeling, we used Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-
mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 
and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 500, 
Molecular Probes). Photos were taken using a confocal lasers 
canning microscope (LSM 510 Pascal, Carl Zeiss).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Identification of EGFP expression in the oligo-dendrocyte 
lineage cells of transgenic zebrafish
To identify the genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation 
and myelination, we isolated OPCs and differentiated oligoden-
dro cytes expressing EGFP from the transgenic zebrafish and com-
pared their transcriptional profiles. Therefore, the embryo stages 
suitable for collecting OPCs and differentiated oligodendrocytes 
were first identified. Previously, we have shown that olig2-expres-
sing precursor cells in the pMN precursor domain of the ventral 
spinal cord first generate motor neurons during neuro-genesis and 
later produce migrating OPCs, which express olig2 continuously 
to the mature oligo-dendrocyte stage (Park et al., 2002a; Park and 
Appel, 2003; Park et al., 2004). As soon as OPCs are specified in 
the pMN precursor domain, sox10 starts to be expressed speci-

fi cally in the oligoden-drocyte lineage cells. Larvae carrying the 
Tg(olig2:egfp) and Tg(sox10:egfp) transgenic reporters, which 
express EGFP under the control of the olig2 and sox10 promoters 
(Shin et al., 2003; Carney et al., 2006), respectively, were examined 
for use in the transcriptome analysis. 
Expression of EGFP in OPCs and mature oligo-dendrocytes at 
several developmental stages in the Tg(olig2:egfp) and Tg(sox10: 
egfp) larvae was verified by fluorescence microscopy using trans-
verse sections of the spinal cord. By 2 days post- fertilization (dpf), 
sox10:EGFP+ cells are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord, 
in which Hu+ neurons are located, indicating that sox10:EGFP+ 
cells are undifferentiated OPCs (Fig. 1A, arrow-heads). By 5 dpf, 
sox10:EGFP+ OPCs have migrated to the white matter of the spi-
nal cord and differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes with 
mul ti ple processes (Fig. 1B, arrows). Labeling of the spinal cord 
of Tg(olig2:egfp) larvae with anti-Sox10, a marker for OPCs and 
mature oligo-dendrocytes, revealed that Sox10+, olig2:EGFP+ 
cells are located in the gray matter of ventral spinal cord at 2 dpf, 
in di cating that these cells are undif-ferentiated OPCs (Fig. 1C,

arrow heads). Sox10+, olig2:EGFP+ cells migrated to the white 
ma tter and differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes po s-
se ss ing multiple process by 5 dpf (Fig. 1D, arrows). These data 
demon strated that in the spinal cord of Tg(olig2:egfp) and Tg 
(sox10:egfp) larvae, EGFP-expressing cells are OPCs at 2 dpf 
and mature oligodendrocytes at 5 dpf. Thus, OPCs and mature 
oligodendrocytes can be obtained by sorting EGFP+ cells from Tg 
(olig2:egfp) and Tg(sox10:egfp) 2 dpf and 5 dpf larvae, respec tively. 
To identify the genes specific to oligodendrocytes, a comparison 
of transcriptional profiles of normal and oligodendrocyte-
deficient larvae could be con-ducted. Previously, oligodendrocyte 
development was shown to require histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
activity (Marin-Husstege et al., 2002; Cunliffe and Casaccia-
Bonnefil, 2006; Ye et al., 2009), and treatment with the HDAC 
inhibitor Trichostatin A can block formation of oligodendrocytes 
in zebrafish (Tsai et al., 2006). Consistent with previous reports, we 
found that treatment of Tg(olig2:egfp) embryos with TSA from 36 
hours post fertilization (hpf) to 5 dpf blocked migration of Sox10+, 
olig2:EGFP+ oligodendrocytes, which are located in the white 
matter of the spinal cord in the normal 3 dpf larvae (Fig. 1E and F, 
arrows indicate mature oligoden-drocytes). These data indicated 
that comparison of transcriptional profiles of EGFP+ cells from 
TSA- treated and untreated Tg(olig2:egfp) larvae can be used to 
identify genes expressed specifically in oligodendrocytes.

Microarray-based transcriptome analysis to identify genes 
involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation
On the basis of the above data, OPCs and mature oligodendro-
cytes were purified from the dis-sociated cells of Tg(olig2:egfp) 
and Tg(sox10:egfp) larvae at 2 dpf and 5 dpf, respectively, using 
FACS. EGFP+ cells were also purified from TSA-treated and 
untreated 3 dpf Tg(olig2:egfp) larvae. Prior to sorting of EGFP+ 
cells, dissociated cells from the Tg(olig2:egfp) and Tg(sox10:egfp) 
larvae contained 20% EGFP+ cells (Fig. 2A~C). After sorting, an 
average of 98% of the sorted cells was EGFP+ OPCs or mature 
oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2D~F). To confirm the purity of the 
sorted cells, total RNA was isolated from EGFP+ mature oligo-
dendrocytes and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed with 
several PCR primers specific to mature oligodendrocytes, neurons, 
and blood vessels. Mature oligodendrocyte specific genes were 
successfully amplified by RT-PCR, but neuron and blood vessel 
specific genes were not. These data indicate that oligodendrocyte 
lineage cells were specifically isolated by FACS (Fig. 2G).
To compare the transcriptional profiles of OPCs and mature 
oligodendrocytes, we purified RNA from the sorted cells and 
synthesized dye-labeled cDNAs, which were hybridized to 
microarray gene chips. A total of 19,956 transcripts were examined 
with the Agilent zebrafish gene expression microarray. Genes up-
regulated by 2.5-fold in mature oligodendrocytes were identified as 
genes required for oligoden-drocyte maturation and genes down-

regulated to 0.3-fold or less in mature oligodendrocytes were 
identified as genes required for the maintenance of OPC status. 
Fig. 3A and B illustrate diagram-matically the 4348 up-regulated 
and 1808 down- regulated genes in mature oligodendrocytes 
com-pared to OPCs as analyzed by three different algorithms. 
In addition, a total of 32 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated 
genes were selected from the intersection of the three algorithms 
(Fig. 3A, B). To confirm the accuracy of the microarray screen, 
we searched the expression profile of well-charac-terized 
genes required for the oligodendrocyte differentiation, such 
as mpz, plp1b, mag, cldnk and flj13639, and found that the 
expression levels of these genes were highly elevated in mature 
oligodendrocytes (Fig. 3C), indicating that our microarray analysis 
was successful.

Validation of microarray data by quantitative RT-PCR 
(qRT-PCR)
To validate the microarray data, we performed a qRT-PCR analy-
sis of selected genes which ex-hibited highly elevated expression 
levels in the differentiated oligodendrocytes. We selected seven

genes not previously known to be involved in oligo-dendrocyte 
differentiation. The expression levels for bhlhe40 (basic helix-
loop-helix family, member e40, NM_212679), dlg1 (discs, large 
(Drosophila) homolog 1, NM_199526), rbp2a (retinol binding 
protein 2a, cellular, NM_153004), rock2b (rho-associated, 
coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2b, NM_001093747), 
sepp1a (selenoprotein P, plasma, 1a, NM_178297), zgc:110190 
(NM_001020570) and zgc:112160 (NM_001017724) were 
evaluated by qRT-PCR using RNA purified from the sorted OPCs 
and mature oligodendrocytes. Myelin basic protein (mbp) was 
used as a positive control, and the expression levels of the selected 
genes are presented as the relative induction in differentiated oli go-
dendrocytes compared to OPCs. Consistent with the microarray 
profiles, qRT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of these seven 
genes was highly elevated in differentiated oligodendrocytes (Fig. 
4), suggesting that all seven genes may be involved in oli go den-
drocyte differentiation.
Basic helix-loop-helix family member e40 (bHLHB2, also 
known as Dec1/Eip1/Sharp2/Stra13/Clast5) is a novel cAMP-
inducible bHLH protein family member. Stra13 is required for the 
proliferation and dif-ferentiation of nerve cells. Stra13 controls 
growth arrest, and represses the expression of cell proli-feration 
associated genes through an HDAC1- independent mechanism 
(Sun and Taneja, 2000). Dec1 is expressed in the nuclei of endo thelial, 
glial and neuronal cells in brain tissue (Preusser et al., 2005). 
Since the bHLHB2 expression level is elevated in differentiated 
oligodendrocytes, we hypothesize that bHLHB2 plays a role in 
oligo-dendrocyte differentiation by regulating the OPC cell cycle. 
Discs-large homolog 1 (Dlg1) is a multi- domain scaffolding pro-
tein that is involved in protein trafficking in polarized cells and 
mem brane addition in Drosophila (Lee et al., 2003; Gorczyca et al., 
2007). Dlg1 is expressed in myelin-forming Schwann cells, and 
en riched in Schwann cell paranodes where myelin outfoldings 
pre ferentially arise. In-terestingly, dlg1 interacts with kinesin 13B 
(kif13B) and Sec8, which play a central role in oligoden-drocyte 
membrane formation by regulating the re-cruitment of vesicles 
that transport myelin proteins, suggesting that dlg1 function 
may be required for oligodendrocyte differentiation (Bolis et 
al., 2009). Retinol binding protein 2a (Rbp2a/CRBP) is a cyto-
pla smic retinol-specific binding protein and is expressed in 
the lateral ganglionic eminences (LGE), where a second wave 
of OPCs originate in the telencephalon (Kessaris et al., 2008). 
Retinol is naturally converted into retinoic acid which regulates 
the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation in vivo (Barres et 
al., 1994). Therefore, we hypothesize that Rbp2a may play a role in 
oligodendrocyte development together with retinol.
Rho-GTPase family proteins play important roles in coordinating

the remodeling of the actin cyto-skeleton during myelination. 
A key effecter of Rho-GTPase is Rho-kinase (ROCK), a serine/ 
threonine kinase that regulates cell migration, proliferation and 
survival (Mueller et al., 2005). ROCK is expressed in Schwann 
cells at the onset of myelination, and pharmacological inhibition 
of ROCK activity causes Schwann cells form aberrant short myelin 
segments. However, after ROCK inhibition is removed, new myelin 
segments are formed normally (Melendez-Vasquez et al., 2004), 
indicating that ROCK plays an important role together with Rho- 
GTPase in the progression of the Schwann cell membrane encase-
ment of the axon during myelination. Rho-associated coiled-coil 
containing protein kinase 2b (Rock2b) is a ROCK family protein 
and our microarray data showed that Rock2b expression was hi-
ghly elevated in myelina-ting oligodendrocytes, suggesting the 
possibility that Rock2b function is involved in myelin formation in 
CNS oligodendrocytes. Selenoprotein P, plasma, 1a (Sepp1a) is 
a selenium binding protein. Selenium is an essential micronutrient 
necessary for normal growth and function of the brain, and sele-
ni um deficiency causes a CNS demyelinating disease. Seleni um 
is required for the normal morphological development of oligo-
den drocytes and their survival in vitro (Eccleston and Silberberg, 
1984), and is also required for the normal up-regulation of myelin 
genes in differentiating oligodendrocytes (Gu et al., 1997). Therefore, 
significant up-regulation of Sepp1a in mature oligodendrocytes 
indicates the possibility that Sepp1a is involved in selenium signa-
ling in oligodendrocyte differentiation. We also examined the 
pre  viously unannotated genes zgc:110191 and zgc:112160. These 
two novel factors are expressed at elevated levels in differentiated 
oligodendrocytes.
