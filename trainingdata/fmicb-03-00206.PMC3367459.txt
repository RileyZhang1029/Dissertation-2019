Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeﬁciency virus isolated
from a macaque monkey (SIVmac) are assumed to have originated from simian immun-
odeﬁciency virus isolated from sooty mangabey (SIVsm). Despite their close similarity in
genome structure, HIV-2 and SIVmac show different sensitivities toTRIM5α, a host restric-
tion factor against retroviruses. The replication of HIV-2 strains is potently restricted by
rhesus (Rh) monkeyTRIM5α, while that of SIVmac strain 239 (SIVmac239) is not. Viral cap-
sid protein is the determinant of this differential sensitivity toTRIM5α, as the HIV-2 mutant
carrying SIVmac239 capsid protein evaded Rh TRIM5α-mediated restriction. However, the
molecular determinants of this restriction mechanism are unknown. Electrostatic potential
on the protein-binding site is one of the properties regulating protein–protein interactions.
In this study, we investigated the electrostatic potential on the interaction surface of cap-
sid protein of HIV-2 strain GH123 and SIVmac239. Although HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239
capsid proteins share more than 87% amino acid identity, we observed a large difference
between the two molecules with the HIV-2 GH123 molecule having predominantly posi-
tive and SIVmac239 predominantly negative electrostatic potential on the surface of the
loop between α-helices 4 and 5 (L4/5). As L4/5 is one of the major determinants of Rh
TRIM5α sensitivity of these viruses, the present results suggest that the binding site of
the Rh TRIM5α may show complementarity to the HIV-2 GH123 capsid surface charge
distribution.

INTRODUCTION
The host range of human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
is narrow, limited to humans and chimpanzees (Gao et al., 1999).
HIV-1 fails to replicate in activated CD4-positive T lymphocytes
from Old World monkeys (OWM), such as rhesus (Rh; Shibata
et al., 1995; Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996) and cynomol-
gus (CM) monkeys (Akari et al., 1996, 1999). On the other
hand, simian immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV) isolated from sooty
mangabey (SIVsm) and SIV isolated from African green monkey
(SIVagm) replicate well in their natural hosts (VandeWoude and
Apetrei, 2006). SIV isolated from a macaque monkey (SIVmac)
evolved from SIVsm in captive macaques, and replicates efﬁciently
in Rh (Shibata et al., 1995; Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996) and
CM (Akari et al., 1996, 1999) monkeys. Human immunodeﬁciency
virus type 2 (HIV-2) is assumed to have originated from SIVsm
as the result of zoonotic events involving monkeys and humans
(Hahn et al., 2000). Previous studies have shown that HIV-2 strains
vary widely in their ability to grow in cells of OWM (Castro et al.,
1990, 1991; Locher et al., 1998, 2003; Fujita et al., 2003).

TRIM5α was identiﬁed as an anti-HIV-1 host restriction fac-
tor in Rh monkey cells (Stremlau et al., 2004). TRIM5 proteins
are members of the tripartite motif family containing RING, B-
box, and coiled-coil domains. The α isoform of TRIM5 has an

additional C-terminal PRYSPRY domain (Reymond et al., 2001).
TRIM5α recognizes the multimerized capsid (viral core) of an
incoming virus by its PRYSPRY domain and causes degradation
of the core (Sebastian and Luban, 2005; Stremlau et al., 2006).
In CM monkey, TRIM5α has also been shown to restrict HIV-1
infection (Nakayama et al., 2005).

We previously evaluated the sensitivity of HIV-2 and SIVmac
to Rh and CM TRIM5αs, and found that HIV-2 strain GH123
carrying P at position 120 of the capsid protein (CA) was potently
restricted by CM TRIM5α, while the HIV-2 GH123 mutant in
which P was replaced with Q was resistant to CM TRIM5α (Song
et al., 2007). In contrast, Rh TRIM5α potently restricted the repli-
cation of both viruses (Kono et al., 2008). Three amino acid
residues, TFP, at positions 339–341 in the PRYSPRY domain of
Rh TRIM5α were necessary for restricting HIV-2 strains that
were resistant to CM TRIM5α (Kono et al., 2008). Although SIV-
mac239 CA possesses Q at position 118 corresponding to position
120 of GH123, SIVmac239 was resistant to both of CM and Rh
TRIM5αs (Kono et al., 2008, 2010). Therefore, we attempted to
identify the viral determinant of SIVmac239 underlying evasion
from Rh TRIM5α-mediated restriction, and found that multiple
regions including the N-terminal loop, a loop between α-helices
4 and 5 (L4/5), and a loop between α-helices 6 and 7 (L6/7) in

Electrostatic potential of HIV-2/SIV capsid

the N-terminal half of SIVmac239 CA are necessary for complete
evasion of Rh TRIM5α restriction (Kono et al., 2010).

Apart from the sequence and structural characteristics regu-
lating protein–protein interaction, the electrostatic potential at
the binding site is an important factor allowing molecular interac-
tions. The electrostatic potential on the protein surface is generated
through redistribution of electrons according to local electrical
ﬁelds. It is deﬁned as the potential energy of a proton at a particu-
lar location near a molecule. Negative electrostatic potential results
in attraction of the proton by the concentrated electron density.
Positive electrostatic potential results in repulsion of the proton by
the atomic nuclei in regions where low electron density exists and
nuclear charge is incompletely shielded. Electrostatic effects were
shown to be a major factor in determining the nature and strength
of the interactions between protein surfaces (Dong and Zhou,
2002; Kortemme and Baker, 2002). A complementary charge on
the binding site of both proteins may result in an attractive force
allowing binding to occur.

In the present study, we analyzed the electrostatic potentials of
the surface regions of the CA loop. We analyzed two CA variants,
HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 CAs, showing opposite restriction
phenotypes. We ﬁrst modeled the 3-D structures of the pro-
teins by homology modeling and next calculated the electrostatic
potentials in the regions of interest based on Adaptive Poisson–
Boltzmann Solver and non-local electrostatic method. We found
a large difference in the electrostatic potentials of the loop sur-
face between the HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 CAs, potentially
responsible for the differential TRIM5α sensitivity of these two
viruses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MODELING
The structure of the N-terminal domain of the HIV-1 CA (PDB
number 1GWP; Tang et al., 2002) was used as a template for
building the corresponding domain models of HIV-2 GH123 and
SIVmac239 CAs. The models were built using Modeller 9v4 (Eswar
et al., 2007) and visualized with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).

CALCULATION OF ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIALS
As the initial step preceding electrostatic potential modeling, we
added missing hydrogen atoms and estimated the ionization (pro-
tonation) of the molecules. We used H++ server (Gordon et al.,
2005) http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++, which adds protons to the
input structure according to the calculated ionization states at the
speciﬁed pH of the solvent. The H++ method models molecules
as a low dielectric medium εin in a solvent with a high dielec-
tric constant εout. It additionally allows the user to deﬁne the salt
concentration of the medium and its pH. We used the most biolog-
ically relevant parameters of human cells: pH= 7.2, salinity 1%,
molecule dielectric εin = 10, and medium dielectric εin = 80. The
dielectric parameters were chosen according to the suggestions of
the authors of the H++ method as appropriate for modeling pro-
tonation of surface residues. We also inspected electrostatic poten-
tial proﬁles resulting from several other parameter combinations.
Other parameter regimes did not produce markedly different elec-
trostatic potentials in the region of interest. Therefore, we chose
the initial parameters as the most relevant for biological settings.

We next applied two methods of electrostatic potential calcu-
lation: Adaptive Poisson–Boltzmann Solver (APBS; Baker et al.,
2001) and non-local electrostatic method (Hildebrandt et al.,
2007). In both methods, electrostatic properties are described by
the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, a second-order non-linear par-
tial differential equation. APBS method solves the equation using
ﬁnite element techniques based on parameter discretization and
iterative parallel reﬁnement of the equation solution. The non-
local electrostatic method allows inclusion of the structure of water
molecules in the calculation and describes the system as a contin-
uum. This method captures the effects of the dipole polarization of
water molecules and the effects of the surrounding hydrogen bond
network, and is therefore a more accurate model of the electrostatic
potential estimations close to the molecule-solvent interface.

We used two different

surface approximations: solvent-
accessible surface (SAS) of two different sizes. SAS is the surface
of a molecule that is accessible to a solvent. It is estimated using
a “rolling ball” approach (Shrake and Rupley, 1973) in which a
sphere of solvent of a particular radius is used to probe the sur-
face of the molecule, the surface is then described by the center
of the probing sphere. We used the approximate radius of a water
molecule of 1.4 Å and an additional 3 Å to determine how the
electrostatic potential changes with distance from the molecule.

RESULTS
THE 3-D STRUCTURAL MODELS OF HIV-2 GH123 AND SIVmac239 CA
N-TERMINAL DOMAINS
Previously, we evaluated the sensitivity of HIV-2 GH123 and SIV-
mac239 to Rh and CM TRIM5αs, and found that HIV-2 GH123
was sensitive to CM and Rh TRIM5αs (Song et al., 2007; Kono et al.,
2008; Figure 1A). In contrast, SIVmac239 was resistant to CM and
Rh TRIM5αs (Kono et al., 2008, 2010; Figure 1A). CA is the deter-
minant for this differential sensitivity to TRIM5α between HIV-2
GH123 and SIVmac239, as the HIV-2 GH123 mutant carrying
SIVmac239 CA (HIV-2 GH/SCA) was also resistant to CM and
Rh TRIM5αs (Figure 1A; Kono et al., 2010). Despite this marked
difference in TRIM5α sensitivity between HIV-2 GH123 and SIV-
mac239, CA of these two viruses share more than 87% amino
acid identity (Figure 1B). Therefore, we compared the structural
properties of HIV-2 GH123 CA with those of SIVmac239.

We ﬁrst constructed 3-D models of HIV-2 GH123 and SIV-
mac239 CA N-terminal domains by homology modeling. In
the constructed models, HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 CA N-
terminal domains showed the most striking differences in shape
of surface exposed loops (Figure 2). SIVmac239 CA is character-
ized by a more contracted shape as compared to the expanded loop
structure of HIV-2 GH123. To conﬁrm that this shape difference is
not due to modeling noise, we remodeled both proteins using each
one as a template for the other. The remodeled structures showed
similar shape differences (data not shown), suggesting that the real
structures differ.

carrying SIVmac239 capsid protein (HIV-2 GH/SCA), and SIVmac239 to
cynomolgus (CM) and rhesus (Rh) monkey TRIM5α. The replication of
HIV-2 GH123 was potently restricted by CM and Rh TRIM5α (sensitive),
while that of SIVmac239 and the HIV-2 GH123 mutant carrying

SIVmac239 capsid was not (resistant). (B) Alignment of amino acid
sequences of HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 capsid proteins. Positions of
the N-terminal loop (N-terminal), a loop between α-helices 4 and 5 (L4/5),
and a loop between α-helices 6 and 7 (L6/7) are indicated above the
amino acid sequences.

To quantify this observation and obtain further insight into
the speciﬁc region where the electrostatic potential differences
are strong, we extracted the electrostatic potential values on the
surfaces of the two molecules. From the electrostatic potential
values estimated in a grid covering the entire space around the
molecules, we extracted grid points neighboring the points of tri-
angulation of each surface type. We grouped these electrostatic
potential values according to the atoms of the closest loop residues.
This comparison of grouped electrostatic potential values of cor-
responding residues in the two analyzed molecules allowed us to
quantitatively conﬁrm the differences in electrostatic potential in
the region of interest and to point to speciﬁc residues around
which the differences were stronger. The strongest difference in
electrostatic potential between HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 CAs
was observed on the surface of L4/5, with HIV-2 GH123 and
SIVmac239 showing positive and negative electrostatic potential,
respectively. Eight of nine residues in this loop showed signiﬁcant
differences in mean electrostatic potential and clear separation
of the electrostatic potential values on the grid neighboring to
the loop residues by both local ABPS and non-local electrostatic
methods (Table 1).

Residues in L6/7 showed weak but similar electrostatic poten-
tial differences to those of L4/5 by the local ABPS method, but
these differences were not conﬁrmed by the non-local electrosta-
tic method (Table 1). The N-terminal loop showed the opposite
pattern, with HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 having negative and
positive electrostatic potentials, respectively, according to the local
APBS method (Table 1). However, the differences were smaller
and were not conﬁrmed by the non-local electrostatic method
(Table 1).

Similar electrostatic potential differences, although spanning
a narrower range of values than those described above, were

Electrostatic potential of HIV-2/SIV capsid

observed on the SAS of the 3 Å probe radius (data not shown).
These observations reﬂect the electrostatic potential decrease with
distance from the molecule surface.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we constructed 3-D models of HIV-2 GH123
and SIVmac239 CA N-terminal domains by homology model-
ing and analyzed the electrostatic potential distributions on the
SASs of these molecules. We observed a large difference between
the HIV-2 GH123 and SIVmac239 CA N-terminal domains, with
the HIV-2 GH123 molecule having predominantly positive and
SIVmac239 predominantly negative electrostatic potential on the
surface of L4/5. This result may be relevant to the previous ﬁndings
that CA L4/5 was one of the major determinants for the differential
sensitivity to Rh TRIM5α between HIV-2 and SIVmac239 (Ylinen
et al., 2005; Kono et al., 2010).

Precise calculation of the interaction electrostatics is challeng-
ing due to the large surfaces involved and the large structural
changes that can occur upon binding. Here, our quantitative
approach based on two different methods for calculation of elec-
trostatic potential indicated negative electrostatic potential on
the surface of the resistant CA variant SIVmac239 and posi-
tive electrostatic potential of the non-resistant HIV-2 GH123
variant. The presence of positive electrostatic potential on the
surface of L4/5 may therefore be a prerequisite for the interac-
tions with Rh TRIM5α. This loop is the most outward pointing
part of the CA protein. Complementarity to the HIV-2 GH123
surface charge distribution at the binding site of the host pro-
tein may be necessary for binding. Therefore, similar studies
of TRIM5α surface electrostatic potentials could help to point
to the speciﬁc site of this interaction, although the 3-D struc-
tural analysis of TRIM5α PRYSPRY domain is required for this
goal.

It was recently reported that a recombinant TRIM5α pro-
tein carrying TRIM21 RING domain (TRIM5-21R) assembled
to form 2-D paracrystalline hexagonal arrays in vitro (Ganser-
Pornillos et al., 2011). This assembly requires RING and B-
box 2 domains, and the hexagonal lattices of HIV-1 CA that
mimic the surface of core act as template for stabilization of
TRIM5-21R arrays in a PRYSPRY-dependent manner (Ganser-
Pornillos et al., 2011). As the interaction between individ-
ual CA monomers and TRIM5α is very weak, CA recog-
nition by TRIM5α is thought to be a synergistic combina-
tion of direct binding interactions with the PRYSPRY domain,

higher-order assembly of TRIM5α, template-based assembly,
and lattice complementarity. Therefore, the electrostatic poten-
tial might be the crucial determinant of this binding allowing
TRIM5α for recognition of a broader range of CA sequence
variants.

In addition to L4/5, our previous study revealed that the N-
terminal loop and L6/7 in the N-terminal half of SIVmac239 CA
are also necessary for complete evasion of Rh TRIM5α restric-
tion (Kono et al., 2010). Electrostatic potentials of these 2 loops
did not show large differences between HIV-2 GH123 and SIV-
mac239. Therefore, it is possible that a certain interaction other
than the electrostatic interaction would be involved in binding of
Rh TRIM5α PRYSPRY domain with the N-terminal loop and L6/7
of HIV-2 GH123.

On sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis, SIVmac239 CA is known to migrate at a molec-
ular weight of 27 kDa, while HIV-2 GH123 CA migrates at a
molecular weight of 25 kDa (Kono et al., 2010). However, the
number of amino acid residues in SIVmac239 CA is smaller
than that in HIV-2 GH123 CA (Figure 1B), and the molecular
weight of SIVmac239 CA is therefore smaller than that of HIV-
2 GH123. We reported previously that the amino acid sequences
of L4/5 determined this differential electrophoretic mobility of
CAs (Kono et al., 2010). The difference seems to be attribut-
able to the presence of non-polar P and A residues at positions
91 and 92, respectively, in L4/5 of HIV-2 GH123 CA, where two
more hydrophilic Q residues are located in SIVmac239 CA L4/5
(Figure 1; Table 1). In addition, HIV-2 GH123 CA L4/5 has
a hydrophobic L insertion at position 90 (Figure 1; Table 1).
Therefore, L4/5 of HIV-2 GH123 CA is more hydrophobic and
would attract larger numbers of SDS molecules than that of SIV-
mac239 leading to accelerated electrophoretic speed of the CA.
It is therefore possible that hydrophobic interactions between
Rh TRIM5α and viral CAs would also be involved in deter-
mining the anti-viral speciﬁcity of TRIM5α in addition to the
electrostatic interactions discussed above. Further biochemical
studies of TRIM5α and viral CAs are necessary to address this
question.
