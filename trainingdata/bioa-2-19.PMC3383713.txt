COMMENTARY

STARD9/Kif16a is a novel mitotic kinesin and antimitotic target

Proper cell division requires the for-

mation of the microtubule-based
mitotic spindle, which mediates the dyn-
amic movement and alignment of chro-
mosomes to the metaphase plate and
their equal transmission to daughter cells.
Kinesins are molecular motors that utilize
ATP hydrolysis to perform their func-
tions and are instrumental
in spindle
assembly and function. Of the over 45
kinesins encoded in the human genome,
only two are specifically enriched at the
centrioles, Kif24 at the mother centriole
and STARD9/Kif16a at
the daughter
centriole. While Kif24 possesses centrio-
lar microtubule-depolymerizing activity
and has been implicated in regulating
cilia formation, our recent study impli-
cates STARD9 in maintaining pericen-
triolar material (PCM) cohesion during
early mitosis. However, very little is
known about how STARD9 performs
its function,
including the mechanisms
that recruit or retain STARD9 at the
centrioles and how it cooperates with
centrosome components to regulate PCM
stability. Additionally, the signals leading
to apoptosis in the absence of STARD9
remain to be explored.

During interphase, mammalian centro-
somes play critical roles in organizing the
cells microtubule array that functions to
define cell shape, polarity and motility.1
Centrosomes are pivotal for the fidelity of
karyokinesis (the division of the nuclear
material during cell division),
including
the organization of
the mitotic micro-
tubule spindle, which carries out chromo-
some congression during prometaphase
and
during
anaphase of mitosis.1 At

centrosomes are two microtubule-based
barrel like structures known as centrioles
(Fig. 1). Centrioles are composed of nine
form hollow
triplet microtubules
cylinders.2 The two centrioles
(mother
and daughter) can be distinguished from
each other, as the mother centriole has
added protein-based appendages at
its
distal end.2 Centrioles are surrounded by
an amorphous protein rich matrix, the
pericentriolar material (PCM), which is
primarily composed of Pericentrin and
CG-NAP (Fig. 1).2 During interphase
centrosomes contain a small PCM that
expands and matures (recruits additional
proteins) at mitotic entry, a process that is
necessary to resist the centrosome directed
forces that are generated by microtubule
associated molecular motors, like dynein
and kinesins.2,3 These forces are not only
critical
for nuclear envelope breakdown
but also for pushing and pulling chromo-
somes to the metaphase plate. Thus, the
PCM has important roles in organizing
spindle
assembly through microtubule
nucleation, elongation, and for resisting

understanding of what recruits or retains
STARD9 or Kif24 to the centrioles.
Centrioles contain d- and ε-tubulin iso-
forms not usually found in other micro-
tubule based structures.13-16 In addition,
unlike the bulk of polymerized micro-
tubule
centriolar microtubules
are highly polyglutamylated and this
modification is thought to regulate the
association of centrosomal MAPs (micro-
tubule-associated proteins)
to the cen-
trioles.17-21 However, these modifications
apply to both centrioles and they are
unlikely
for
STARD9 or Kif24. Although the micro-
tubule-binding and ATPase activities of
the STARD9 motor domain are required
for
localization to centrioles, other
factors are likely to play a role.7 Centro-
somal components are highly phosphory-
lated by mitotic kinase families
(like
Cdk, Plk, Aurora and Nek)
in early
mitosis.22 Therefore, phosphorylation of

recognition by the FHA phospho-
protein binding domain of STARD9
could be a plausible targeting mechanism.
However, only a handful of proteins
have been identified enriched at daughter
centrioles, most notably Centrobin.6,23
These proteins appear to be associated
with the daughter centriole throughout
the cell cycle.6,23 Conversely, STARD9 has
a dynamic localization and only associates
with centrioles from the onset of mitosis
to late anaphase, indicating that its locali-
zation is regulated in a spatial-temporal
manner (Fig. 1C).7 Thus, further experi-
mentation will be necessary to define the
mechanisms of STARD9 localization.

The expansion of the PCM during late
G2-phase is thought to be critical for the
absorption of microtubule and molecular
motor-dependent
forces during bipolar
spindle assembly and the absence of an
expanded PCM leads
to centrosome

led to PCM fragmentation and multi-
polar spindle formation in human cells.24
Similarly, depletion of STARD9 leads to
PCM fragmentation, multipolar spindles,
and mitotic cell death (apoptosis).7 Like
STARD9, Kizuna is only conserved in
vertebrates,
indicating that higher orga-
nisms have more sophisticated mecha-
nisms that reinforce the PCM to deal
with centrosome-directed forces.24 Kizuna
binds to Cep72 and this interaction is
required for its localization to the PCM,
where it associates with CG-NAP, peri-
centrin and c-tubulin.24,25 The mecha-
nism by which STARD9 functions
to
cohere the expanded PCM has not been
determined. Unlike Kizuna that localizes
to the PCM, STARD9 localizes
to
daughter centrioles.7,11

kinesins have critical

the PCM is matured and syntelic

able to remain arrested for prolonged
periods of time, upwards of 18 h, before
they activate an apoptotic response and
die. Most
importantly these arrests are
reversible,
if the drug is washed out of
these cells they recover and continue to
divide. These stable and reversible arrests
are a critical problem in the treatment
of cancer. With sufficient time, cells are
able to slip out of mitosis or wait for
drug clearance and can continue to divide.
In contrast, STARD9-depleted cells dis-
play a fragmented PCM, form multipolar
spindles, activate the spindle assembly

and undergo apoptosis.7
Interestingly,
STARD9-depleted cells undergo apoptosis
with faster kinetics than Plk1 or Kinesin-5
inhibited cells, indicating that their mitotic
arrests differ.7 Although the triggers that
activate the apoptotic pathway in response
to antimitotics or STARD9-depletion are
poorly defined, it is tempting to speculate
that PCM fragmentation, defective micro-
tubule
or DNA tearing
observed in STARD9-depleted cells could
be plausible apoptotic triggers. Centro-
some expansion/maturation occurs in late
G2 phase and prepares the centrosome for
increased microtubule density required in
mitotic spindle assembly.37,38 Stabilization

Our studies with STARD9-depletions
indicate that compromising the integrity
of the PCM may be a trigger for apoptosis
and that inhibition of STARD9’s function
may be a viable approach to inhibiting

cancer cell division. The PCM fragmenta-
tion and spindle assembly defects observed
in STARD9-depleted cells are conserved
among multiple types of cancer cell lines.7
However, depletion of STARD9 in a
panel of non-small cell
lung carcinomas
indicated that only specific
(NSCLC)
subtypes of NSCLC cell lines were sensi-
tive to STARD9-depletion.7 This raises
the possibility that the genetic background
of each type of cancer contributes to the
cell death response. Genetic variation
could modify the
timing of mitotic
progression, the presence or absence of
mitotic checkpoints, or the activation of
compensatory mechanisms
could
render a cell
resistant. The types and
subtypes of cancers that are responsive to
STARD9-depletion must be defined to
fully assess if STARD9-inhibition will be
an effective avenue to pursue in inhibit-
ing cancer cell division and to identify
markers that will predict anti-STARD9-
inhibitor sensitivity. Nonetheless, several
lines of evidence indicate that STARD9
should be pursued as a cancer
target.
STARD9-depleted cells apoptose during
mitosis with faster kinetics than current
antimitotic treatments and STARD9 pos-
sesses an ATP hydrolyzing activity that is
essential for its function and amenable to
small molecule inhibition.7 In addition,
depletion of STARD9 strongly synergizes
with taxol treatment, making STARD9 an
appealing candidate target for combined
cancer therapies.7

The study of STARD9 is in its infancy.
Future studies aimed at understanding
the mechanisms of STARD9s function
and regulation and the factors that render
cells sensitive to STARD9-depletion will
be invaluable to understanding the mecha-
nisms driving cancer cell division and
how inhibition of these mechanisms can
be used to treat cancer.
