Conventional method of cell culture studies has been performed on two-dimensional substrates. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) 
cell culture platforms have been a subject of interest as cells in 3D has significant differences in cell differentiation and behavior. Here 
we report a novel approach of 3D cell culture using a nylon micro mesh (NMM) as a cell culture scaffold. NMM is commonly used 
in cell culture laboratory, which eliminates the requirement of special technicality for biological laboratories. Furthermore, it is made 
of a micro-meter thick nylon fibers, which was adequate to engineer in cellular scales. We demonstrate the feasibility of the NMM as 
a 3D scaffold using E18 rat hippocampal neurons. NMM could be coated with cell adhesive coatings (polylysine or polyelectrolyte) 
and neurons showed good viability. Cells were also encapsulated in an agarose hydrogel and cultured in 3D using NMM. In 
addition, the 3D pattern of NMM could be used as a guidance cue for neurite outgrowth. The flexible and elastic properties of 
NMMs made it easier to handle the scaffold and also readily applicable for large-scale tissue engineering applications.

INTRODUCTION

Conventional method of cell culture studies has been performed 
on 2-dimensional (2D) surfaces such as glass, well plate and Petri 
dishes. Theses 2D cell culture platforms are widely used because 
of the easy of handling, its convenience and bio-compatibility. 
Although the understanding of basic biology has been improved 
with these advantages of 2D systems, many scientists give careful 
attention to 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture system due to the 
limitation of 2D environment (Lund et al., 2009).
Two-dimensional substrates have a limitation in the replication

of 3D cellular environments and the absence of 3D factors in 
cellular developments could limit the biological outcome in 
the culture (Zhang, 2004). Moreover, cells cultured on the 2D 
substrate have to adapt to rigid and flat surfaces while natural in 
vivo environments have large influences from microenvironments 
derived from extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell interactions. 
Recent studies showed that the elements of 2D environment that 
were different from 3D environment could lead to change from 
gene expression to cell functionality (Zahir and Weaver, 2004; 
Birgersdotter et al., 2005). 
There have been active pursuits in developing new biomaterials 
for 3D cell culture scaffolds (Shin and Mikos, 2003). For example, 
polymer based biomaterials (Cheung et al., 2007), protein based 
biomaterials (Stegemann et al., 2007) and nanofiber (Yoshimoto 
et al., 2003) have been utilized as a 3D cell culture scaffold. And 
with these biomaterials, there have been many applications of

3D cell culture scaffolds (Dutta and Dutta, 2009). For example, 
there were clinical trials that artificial tissues which were made 
by 3D scaffolds used for regenerative medicine (Karageorgiou 
and Kaplan, 2005) and in vitro 3D tissue modeling (Yamada and 
Cukierman, 2007). However, most of the 3D cell culture scaffolds 
require complex fabrication process and expensive equipment that 
is usually not accessible for biologists, which limits the extended 
usage of 3D scaffold systems in cell culture. 
Here we propose a nylon micro-mesh (NMM) as a new 3D cell cul-
ture scaffold based on its mechanical flexibility, biocompatibility, 
and practicality. And we show that NMM is suitable for 3D cell 
culture scaffold and has some potential for 3D tissue engineering 
applications. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Substrate preparation
Three kinds of Nylon micro meshs (NMMs) which had 20, 
10, 8 µm pore size were purchased from Spectrum Laboratories 
(Spectrum, CA, USA). And NMMs with 40 µm pores were taken 
from a cell strainer (BD Falcon, NJ, USA). 
NMMs were sonicated with acetone, isopropylalcohol (IPA) and 
DI water for 5min per each and dried by air stream. NMMs were 
coated with Poly-D-Lysine (PDL, Sigma, MO, USA) by soaking 
the NMMs in PDL solution (0.1 mg/ml in borate buffer, pH 8.5) at 
37oC. After 6 hour, PDL solution was aspirated and NMMs were 
immersed in 70% ethanol for sterilization. After the sterilization, 
NMMs were rinsed with DI water. The NMMs were finally dried 
in clean-bench or incubator. 
Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEL) were coated using layer-by-
layer method. The cleaned NMMs were immerged in the solution 
of Poly allylamine hydrochloride (PAH, 20 mM, pH 9.0, Sigma, 
MO, USA) for 1 min, followed by five times washing with DI 
water. The PAH coated NMMs were immerged in the solution of 
Poly sodium 4-stlrensulfonate (PSS, 60 mM, pH 9.0, Sigma, MO, 
USA) for 1 min, followed by five times washing with DI water. 
The process of PEL coating were repeated ten times and finished 
with the PAH coating. NMMs were sterilized by UV for 5 min and 
dried in clean-bench or incubator. 
Agarose gel (gelling range: 36~39oC, Amresco Inc., Ohio, USA) 
was dissolved in 100oC DI water and 0.7% (w/v) agarose hydrogel 
was formed. After cooling the agarose gel to 36oC, cell suspension 
was mixed with the agarose and plated on PDL coated NMMs. 

Cell culture
Hippocampus tissues were dissected from E18 Sprague/Dawley 
rat embryo. The tissues were washed three times with Hank’s 

Micro Mesh for Three Dimensional Culture Scaffold

Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and mechanically dissociated 
using 1 ml pipette tips. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 3 
min at 1,000 rpm and the cell pellets were suspended again in 
plating medium which was composed of serum free Neurobasal/
B27 (Invitrogen, CA), 12.5 µM L glutamate (sigma, MO), 2 mM 
L glutamine (Gibco) and 1% penicillin streptomysin (invtrogen, 
CA). Finally, the cell suspend plated onto the coated NMMs at the 
density of 200 to 300 cells/mm2. Cultures were maintained in an 
incubator (5% CO2, 37oC). After three days from cell plating, half 
of the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium without L 
glutamine every 3 days. 

Live-dead staining
Neurons were stained by Live-Dead viability/cytotoxicity kit 
(Invitrogen, CA, USA). 10 µl of ethidium homodimer and 2.5 
µl calcein acetocymethyl ester were mixed in 5 ml of phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS). 200 µl of the dye solution was added in 1 
ml sample and covered with aluminum foil to protect the dye 
from photobleaching. After the incubation (5% CO2, 37oC) of the 
sample for 20 min, the solution in the sample was removed and 
NMMs washed with PBS. 

RESULTS

Mechanical properties of nylon micro-mesh as a three 
dimensional cell culture scaffold
Appropriate mechanical properties of 3D scaffold are important 
in 3D tissue engineering (Lee et al., 2008). First, flexibility is 
required to maintain the shape of scaffold and handling. Second, 
micro and nano-scale structural architecture is desirable to mimic 
in vivo microenvironments (Curtis and Wilkinson, 1998; Bayliss 
et al., 1999). Third, some porosity is required for the diffusion of 
nutrients, metabolic wastes and interconnectivity of cells. 
Fig. 1A shows the compliance of the NMM to the mechanical 
bending. It was also easy to handle by hand for forceps. Fig. 1 also 
shows the ordered structures of NMM in micrometer scales. The 
thickness of the individual nylon fiber was 30 or 35 µm and the 
thickness of NMM was 75 µm, 45 µm, 55 µm, 60 µm, respectively 
(Fig. 1B~E). NMMs have many regular pores with the pore 
diameters of 8 µm, 10 µm, 20 µm, and 40 µm (Fig. 1F~I). These 
properties made NMMs suitable for 3D cell culture scaffolds. 

Cell Viability and biocompatibility
Biocompatibility of materials is a crucial parameter, since it 
can be decisive criteria as a culture scaffold. Most of the reported 
scaffolds were composed of ECM molecules (Badylak, 2002), 
or had bioactive molecules to modulate cellular activities (Zhu,

2010), or they had controllability in chemicals (Yildirim et al., 
2010). 
Fig. 2 shows the surface modification of NMMs using positively 
charged polymers. We coated NMMs with either poly-D-lysine 
(PDL) or polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEL). PDL is one of the most 
common polymer used as a cell adhesive coating material. PEL 
was used to modify the NMM surface with much denser positive 
charge layers through layer-by-layer coating technique, which 
turned out to be more efficient in terms of reproducibility and 
reliability. 
In order to investigate the effect of chemical controllability and 
viability of cells on the NMM, we prepared different pore size 
of NMMs coated by PDL and PEL and cell plate. Fig. 3 shows 
excellent cell viability at 9 DIV. Neurons tend to grow on and in-
between the micro-fibers and pores were be filled with neuronal 
growth.

Entrapment of cells in three dimensional space
Entrapment of cells in three dimensional space has a special 
meaning that it provide distinct differences in cell morphogenesis, 
behavior, gene expression, differentiation from 2D environment 
(Holmes et al., 2000; Zaman et al., 2006). In other word, the 
recovered 3D environment cause different viability and func tio-

nality of cell. 
Many of the studies used natural hydrogels or synthetic gel such 
as alginate (Pangas et al., 2003), collagen (Batorsky et al., 2005) 
and poly ethylene glycol (PEG) (Elisseeff et al., 1999) to entrap 
cells. We used agarose hydrogel which is a common material in 
biological laboratories for the cell entrapment (Fig. 2). Fig. 4 shows 
the neuronal growth in agarose hydrogels. Neurons were well 
dispersed in the gel, and neurites were formed and extended (Fig. 
4B, E). They tend to get clustered in the gel after forming thick 
fiber bundles. As the gel was not functionalized to be cell adhesive, 
the clustering process was likely to occur in the matured neuronal 
cultures. However, neurons were still viable and maintained in 3D 
NMM scaffolds. 

Three dimensional neurite guidance effect
As NMMs had ordered structures in micrometer scales (Fig. 
1), each nylon fiber can provide the topographical guidance cues 
to the growing neurites. Fig. 5A shows an example of the guided 
neurite outgrowth along the 3D mesh fibers. The fiber thickness 
was comparable to the size of soma and neurites followed the edge 
of the fibers. This is also shown in scanning electron micrograph 
in Fig. 5B. Fig. 5C shows more ‘patterned’ neurites on the mesh. 
Although the fiber itself was too thick to control thinner neurites, 
its edges clearly had an effect on neurite guidance.

DISCUSSION

In summary, we proposed NMMs as a simple but effective 
3D cell culture scaffold. Unlike other 3D scaffold materials 
that requires expensive or special technicality, NMMs are an 
inexpensive material that is common biological laboratories. 
NMM had excellent mechanical and structural properties to 
support neuronal cell growth and gel based cell cultures. It was 
also chemically modifiable to convert the nylon surface into cell 

adhesive surfaces. Moreover, the micro-scale structural regularity 
could be potentially be applicable to 3D tissue engineering 
applications.
