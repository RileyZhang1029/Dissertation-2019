Enzyme  activities  of  Cenococcum  geophilum  isolates  were  examined  on  enzyme-  specific  solid  media.  Deoxyribonuclease,  phos-
phatase,  and  urease  were  detected  in  all  isolates,  whereas  cellulase  was  not  detected  in  any  of  the  isolates.  Variations  in
enzyme  activities  of  amylase,  caseinolysis,  gelatinase,  lipase,  and  ribonuclease  were  observed  among  isolates.

Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) symbiosis is a mutualistic associa-
tion between EcM fungi and certain woody plants such as
species  of  Pinaceae,  Fagaceae,  Betulaceae,  and  Salicaceae
[1].  EcM  fungi  colonize  root  tips  of  host  plants  and
extend  massive  hyphae  and  rhizomorphs  into  the  soil  [2].
These  fungi  benefit  host  plants  in  a  number  of  ways,
although  the  most  important  function  may  be  enhancing
soil  nutrient  uptake,  particularly  for  elements  with  a  low
mobility in the soil such as nitrogen (N) [3] and phospho-
rus (P) [4]. EcM fungi produce a wide range of extracellu-
lar enzymes that degrade N- and P-compounds contained in
soil  organic  matter  [5, 6].  Such  assimilated  nutrients  are
absorbed  by  the  hyphal  network,  and  then  some  of  the
nutrients  are  transferred  to  the  host  plant  in  exchange  for
carbon,  i.e.,  photosynthate  [1, 3].  It  is  likely  that  the  abil-
ity  to  produce  a  range  of  extracellular  enzymes  by  EcM
fungi  plays  significant roles  in  nutrient acquisition  of  host
plants from soils.

Cenococcum  geophilum  Fr.  (= C.  graniforme)  is  one  of
the most common and widespread EcM fungi [7, 8]. EcM
roots  of  this  fungus have  been  observed,  often  as  a  domi-
nant  species,  from  diverse  ranges  of  habitats  such  as  arc-
tic  forests  and  temperate  and  subtropical  environments
[7].  C.  geophilum  is  well  known  for  its  pioneering  capa-
bility  and  often  invades  dominantly  in  weakly  developed
soils on which EcM hosts have established, such as coastal
pine forests on maritime sand dunes [9]. Due to its poten-
tial  ecological  importance  as  an  EcM  symbiont,  many
studies  have  been  conducted  on  this  fungus  to  understand
its  physiology  [10].  Several  studies  have  revealed  pro-
tease  [5]  and  phosphatase  [11]  activities  of  C.  geophilum;

however,  information  about  extracellular  enzyme  produc-
tion by C. geophilum is still scarce. In particular, the vari-
ation in enzyme activities among isolates remains uncertain.
We investigated amylase, caseinolysis, cellulase, deoxyri-
bonuclease  (DNAse),  gelatinase,  lipase,  pectinase,  phos-
phatase, ribonuclease (RNAse), and urease activities in 29
isolates  of  C.  geophilum.  We  used  enzyme-specific  solid
media,  because  it  permits  an  easy  and  rapid  detection  of
specific enzyme activities from a large number of samples.

Small  soil  samples  (500~1,000 mL)  were  collected  from
13  locations  of  Pinus  thunbergii  Parl.  coastal  forests  or
Pinus  densiflora  Sieb.  et  Zucc.  artificial  forests  in  inland
areas  of  Korea  from  2008  to  2009  (Table  1).  Trappe  [12]
revealed  that  the  sclerotia  of  C.  geophilum  produced  in
soils varies from 0.05 to 4 or more mm in diameter. Thus,
soil  samples  were  put  through  a  0.25-mm  pore  size  sieve
with  tap  water  to  remove  soil  particles  and  to  trap  the  C.
geophilum  sclerotia.  The  trapped  soils  were  spread  on  a
glass  dish,  and  sclerotia  were  picked  up  under  a  dissect-
ing  microscope.  The  sclerotia  were  surface  sterilized  in
30% H2O2 for 5 min, rinsed once in sterilized distilled water,
and  then  transferred  to  modified  Melin-Norkans  (MMN)
agar  medium  [13]  containing  300 µg/mL  streptomycin  sul-
fate.  In  total,  29  C.  geophilum  isolates  were  collected  and
used in this study (Table 1). Each isolate was identified to
species  by  sequencing  the  internal  transcribed  spacer
regions, including the 5.8S rDNA region, and by compar-
ing the sequences to those at the GenBank database of the
National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). DNA extraction, PCR, and sequenc-
ing  were  performed  as  previously  described  [9].  The  iso-

lates  were  incubated  on  MMN  agar  media  in  the  dark  at
25oC until the next procedure. All isolates were deposited in
the  Laboratory  of  Tree  Pathology  and  Mycology  (TPML)
at Kangwon National University, Korea.

MMN  agar  discs  containing  growing  mycelia  were  cut
from  the  edge  of  fungal  cultures  of  each  isolate,  which
were  incubated  on  MMN  agar  plate  medium  for  2  mon,
with  a  5 mm  cork  borer.  Each  disc  was  placed  individu-
ally  on  each  enzyme-specific  media.  Agar  media  described
by  Hankin  and  Anagnostakis  [14]  were  used  for  detect-
ing the production of amylase, DNAase, gelatinase, lipase,
RNAase,  pectate  trans-eliminase,  and  phosphatase.  Agar
media  described  by  Paterson  and  Bridge  [15],  Pointing
(cellulose  agar)  [16],  and  Vuye  and  Pijck  (Christensen
urea agar) [17] were used for detecting caseinolysis activ-
ity,  cellulose,  and  urease  production,  respectively.  After  1
mon  incubation  in  the  dark  at  25oC,  the  production  of
each enzyme was determined as described previously [14-
17].  Five  replicates  were  used  for  each  treatment.  Agar
discs without fungal mycelia were placed on each enzyme-
specific media as a control treatment.

Production  of  DNAase,  phosphatase,  and  urease  was

detected  in  all  isolates  (Table  2,  Fig.  1).  RNAase  was
detected  in 28 of 29 isolates,  indicating  that  it is common
for  C.  geophilum  isolates  to  produce  DNAase,  phos-
phatase,  RNAase,  and  urease,  irrespective  of  their  loca-
tion.  The  roles  of  DNAase  and  RNAase  produced  by  C.
geophilum  are  unknown.  They  may  partly  contribute  to
degrading  intracellular  nucleic  acids  in  dead  microorgan-
isms such as bacteria [18] in soil. They may also be impor-
tant  sources  for  C.  geophilum  autolysis  [19].  Phosphatase
production  is  commonly  observed  in  various  EcM  fungi
[20],  including  C.  geophilum  [11, 21].  Although  seedlings
inoculated  with  C.  geophilum  could  take  up  more  P  from
organic  matter  than  seedlings  not  inoculated  with  EcM
[22], phosphatase activity was relatively lower than that of
other  EcM  fungi  [21].  Urea  is  a  nitrogen  source  for  the
growth  of  many  organisms  and  has  been  used  as  an

important  fertilizer  in  forest  soils.  Several  EcM  fungi  can
use  urea  as  their  sole  nitrogen  source  [23, 24].  Imamura
and  Yumoto  [25]  reported  that  C.  geophilum  EcMs  are
significantly more abundant in urea-nontreated soil than in
treated  soil,  suggesting  that  external  urea  can  be  used  by
C.  geophilum  but  that  it  is  not  likely  a  preferred  nitrogen
source.

Production of amylase, gelatinase, and lipase were vari-
able among isolates; each enzyme activity was detected in
23,  11,  and  15  isolates,  respectively  (Table  2,  Fig.  1).
Amylase  production  by  EcM  fungal  species  has  been
reported  in  species  of  Amanita  and  Cortinarius  [23].  Bae
and  Barton  [11]  detected  α-amylase  binding  on  the  cell
surface  of  C.  geophilum.  Gelatinase  production  has  been
reported  in  various  species  of  EcM  fungi  such  as  Aman-
ita  [23],  and  lipase  activity  has  been  reported  in  Amanita,
Cortinarius,  Lactarius,  Piloderma,  and  Thelephora  [23,
26],  El-Badaoui  and  Botton  [27]  detected  protease  activ-
ity, including gelatinase, in C. geophilum, whereas Nygren
et  al.  [5]  did  not  detect  protease  activity.  Caldwell  et  al.
[26]  did  not  detect  lipase  from  a  C.  geophilum  isolate.

The  discrepancy among these studies and the present study
could  be  partly  attributed  to  variations  in  enzyme  activity
among C. geophilum isolates, as seen in the present study.
A  reaction  was  observed  for  pectate  trans-eliminase  on
enzyme-specific  media  in  eight  isolates;  however,  it  was
unlikely  that  the  reaction  was  derived  from  the  produc-
tion  of  this  enzyme.  Hankin  and  Anagnostakis  [14]  stated
that  clear  zones  around  a  colony  in  an  otherwise  opaque
medium indicate pectin degradation. However, in the present
study,  the  color  of  all  media  changed  to  whitish  from  a
very  pale  brown  original  color  in  eight  isolates,  and  no
clear  zones  were  observed  around  the  colonies.  Several
studies have found that pectinase activity was very low or
absent in EcM fungi [23, 28]. A more accurate determina-
tion  should  be  performed  to  detect  the  activity  of  this
enzyme. Only two C. geophilum isolates had the ability to
hydrolyze casein (skim milk). El-Badaoui and Botton [27]
detected  caseinolysis  activity  in  C.  geophilum,  whereas
Nygren  et  al.  [5]  did  not.  It  is  unlikely  that  C.  geophilum
has  caseinolysis  activity.  Production  of  cellulase  was  not
detected  in  any  isolates.  Previous  studies  also  revealed

128

Obase  et  al.

that  cellulase  activity  is  very  low  or  absent  in  EcM  fungi
[23].

Our results revealed variations in enzyme activities among
the  isolates  of  C.  geophilum  obtained  from  various  parts
of  Korea.  These  variations  were  also  detected  among  iso-
lates  obtained  from  soil  samples  collected  at  the  same
location  (e.g.,  isolate  9-7,  9-8,  9-50,  and  9-51).  Thus,  fur-
ther  studies  are  needed  to  understand  the  significance  of
C.  geophilum  enzyme  activities  and  the  variability  among
isolates.
