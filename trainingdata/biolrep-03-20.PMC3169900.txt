Abstract
Taste is a discriminative sense involving specialized receptor cells of the oral cavity (taste buds) and at least
two distinct families of G protein-coupled receptor molecules that detect nutritionally important
substances or potential toxins. Yet the receptor mechanisms that drive taste also are utilized by
numerous systems throughout the body. How and why these so-called taste receptors are used to
regulate digestion and respiration is now a matter of intense study. In this article we provide a historical
perspective and an overview of these systems, leading to speculations on directions for further research.

Introduction
The sense of taste is both guardian and guide for our
consumption of foods. The sensations of bitter and sour
deter us from ingesting potential toxic substances and
strong acids, while the preferred qualities of sweet, umami
(glutamate), and salty encourage us to eat foods contain-
ing carbohydrates, amino acids, and sodium. Taste
sensations are mediated by taste buds, which are small
clusters of specialized epithelial cells situated within the
oropharynx. Over the last two decades, scientists have
uncovered the array of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
cascades and ion channels that mediate taste signaling.
Expression of
these receptors and channels is not,
however, limited to taste buds. Elements of the taste
transduction cascade are expressed by many chemore-
sponsive epithelial cells scattered within both the alimen-
tary tract and the respiratory passageways. But what are
they doing there? Despite the similarities in receptor
molecules and transduction cascades, the emerging picture
is that the diverse chemoreceptive systems do not all evoke
a sensation of taste, but rather serve different functions
according to their location.

The sensations of taste can be divided into five distinct
qualities: salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami (the taste

of glutamate). The first two of these are transduced by
means of ion channels or gated ion channels expressed
in a variety of tissues such as kidney (e.g., [1]). The last
three qualities rely on two distinct families of GPCRs
first
identified in 1999 in taste tissues [2-5]. Two
different families of taste receptors are known, T1R and
T2R: T1Rs encode the receptor proteins for sweet and
umami, and T2Rs do the same for bitter. Despite the
difference in underlying qualities detected,
the two
families of taste receptors utilize similar, if not identical,
downstream signaling effectors, most notably the
G-protein α-gustducin, phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCβ2),
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 3 (IP3R3),
and the transient receptor potential cation channel
TrpM5 (Figure 1). In fact, these signaling components
appear to be a hallmark for chemosensory transduction.
Indeed, the taste-associated G-protein α-gustducin was
among the first proteins involved in a GPCR taste
transduction cascade to be identified [6] and is still
utilized as a marker for chemosensory cells throughout
the body.

Identification of these key molecules in taste transduction
led several investigators to the surprising conclusion that
these taste transduction mechanisms were widespread

Figure 1. Taste receptor (TR) transduction cascade

The canonical taste transduction cascade starts with one or more TR families of receptor (either T1R or T2R), which couple to a variety of G-protein α subunits, the
best described being gustducin. Receptor activation releases the beta-gamma subunits of the G-protein complex (Gβg), which activate PLCβ2 to generate the
second messenger 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The IP3 then triggers the IP3R3 receptor to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In taste cells, solitary
chemosensory cells and secretory cells, the increased intracellular Ca2+ both activates the TrpM5 channel to depolarize the cell, and facilitates release of
transmitters and hormones. In taste buds, the combined depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ gates hemichannels to effect release of ATP [38,39]. In other
tissues (but not taste buds), the TrpM5-generated depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which further increases levels of intracellular Ca2+. Some cells
express only some elements of the canonical taste transduction cascade and the rise in intracellular Ca2+ acts on other effectors to generate muscle relaxation or
changes in ciliary motility. BKCa channel, calcium-activated big potassium channel; Gαgus, G-protein α-gustducin; Gαtrans, G-protein α-transducin; PLCβ2,

throughout diverse organ systems, including presumed
chemosensory cells of the gut [7,8] and the respiratory
tree [9-11] (Figure 2). The wide distribution of presumed
chemosensory cells all displaying most elements of the
complete taste transduction cascade—from receptor to
transduction channel—suggests that these taste-like func-
tions do not all give rise to sensations of taste. For example,
the pancreatic release of insulin in response to intake of
glucose is partially mediated by detection of the glucose by
sweet taste receptor signaling in cells of the intestine [12],
but this does not generate a sensation of sweetness.
Similarly, accidental inhalation of a beverage into the
airways triggers receptors there, but rather than evoking a
sensation of taste, the substance is irritating and provokes
choking or coughing. The term taste should be reserved for
the specific sensory perception originating in taste buds of
the oropharynx and transmitted via the facial, glossophar-
yngeal, or vagus nerves to ultimately reach the gustatory
cortex after relays in the brainstem and thalamus. So,
although we use the phrases “taste transduction”, and
“taste receptors” below, we do not mean to imply that the

sensations arising from the various systems described are in
any way taste. Where we use the term “taste” inappropri-
ately, we include the quotation marks to denote a more
casual, tongue-in-cheek (sorry about that) usage.

that

This article will explore the diversity of organs that
express elements of the taste transduction cascade and
their functions in each area. Taken together, the findings
suggest
the taste transduction cascade is not
restricted to taste per se or even to systems regulating
food intake. The receptors mediating taste transduction
evolved early in the vertebrate lineage [13], and were
adopted widely as a chemodetection system in a variety
of organ systems. Questions still remain as to what the

“Taste” in the gut
The first indication that elements of the taste transduction
cascade might exist outside of the mouth was the report in
1996 of the expression of the taste signaling-associated

G-protein α-gustducin in brush cells of the stomach and
intestine [7]. Brush cells are tall, columnar epithelial cells
that display a distinctive tuft of stiff microvilli at their apex.
Based on morphological features, it was suggested that
these cells might have a chemosensory function [15], but
the finding of gustducin and later even “taste” receptors
[8,16-19] and TrpM5 [20] in these cells confirmed this
early speculation. More recent studies reveal that taste
transduction-related signaling occurs in a variety of cell
types throughout much of the gut from the stomach to the
large intestine (e.g., [20]) (Figure 2). Despite the wide-
spread expression of taste-related signaling components in
the gut, they are not necessary for the post-ingestive
hedonic reward of ingested sweet substances [21], but
rather serve digestive functions.

The good, the bad, and the tasty
Members of the T1R family of taste receptors combine in
taste cells to form either a sweet receptor (T1R2 + T1R3)
or an umami (glutamate) receptor (T1R1 + T1R3). Both
receptors signal macronutrients necessary for survival (a
carbohydrate energy source and amino acids, respec-
tively) so it is reasonable to consider that these receptors
may respond to similar ligands in the gut to regulate
digestive functions. Indeed, secretory cells of the stomach
express T1R family receptors [18,22] and release the
appetite-inducing peptide ghrelin in response to activa-
tion by the appropriate ligand. Accordingly, when either
sweets or glutamate-rich foods first enter the stomach,
they cause the release of ghrelin, which stimulates further
food intake.

Farther down the gastrointestinal tract, sweet substances
are detected by enteroendocrine cells that secrete the
glucagon-like peptide GLP-1. This hormone is an
incretin, which enhances release of insulin from pan-
creatic β-cells. The presence of circulating insulin results
in uptake of glucose from the bloodstream by diverse
tissues. Activation of the sweet receptors in the gut also
drives insertion of
the glucose transporters SGLT1
(sodium–glucose cotransporter 1) and GLUT2 (facili-
tated glucose transporter 2), in the apical membrane of
cells of the intestinal epithelium, thereby facilitating
uptake of glucose in the upper parts of the gastrointest-
inal tract [17,23].

While the presence of T1R-class receptors for macronu-
trients in the gut is an obvious means to regulate digestive
functions, the reason for the presence of T2R bitter
receptors seems less clear. One clue comes from the
observation that activation of T2R receptors in an
enteroendocrine cell line (STC-1 cells) results in release
of the peptide hormone cholcystokinin (CCK), which
can reduce gut motility. So, intake of a potential toxin

that activates the T2R pathway should decrease the rate
at which food passes through the stomach and lower
the drive for continued eating (presumably this response
inhibits further ingestion of toxin) [24]. The bitter-tasting
ligand induces enteroendocrine cells to release CCK,
which in turn excites sensory nerve processes of the vagus
nerve to carry the signal to the brain [25], suggesting
that
food intake involves both
peripheral and central controls. However, a recent study
[26] suggests that the lower gut motility following intake
of bitter substances is not purely dependent on T2R/
gustducin signaling or CCK.

the regulation of

An alternative explanation is that the CCK-secreting
enteroendocrine cells may be involved in a paracrine
signaling system that reduces transfer of toxic substances
from the gut into the circulation. This is supported by a
study showing that CCK (released in response to bitter-
tasting ligands) then acts on CCK2 receptors [27] on
nearby enterocytes to increase expression of the trans-
porter ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette B1), which pumps
toxins or unwanted substances out of the cytoplasm. In
this way, activation of
the T2R signaling network
indirectly increases elimination of absorbed toxins from
gut epithelium before the toxins can enter circulation.

Lower in the gut, activation of T2R receptors has a
different effect. When some bitter-tasting ligands are
applied to the colonic epithelium,
they induce the
secretion of anions, which leads to fluid secretion by
the epithelium [28]. This induced efflux of fluids is likely
to flush out any noxious irritant from the colon.

“Taste” in the airways
The first description of taste-related signaling components
in the airway was a report by Zancanaro and colleagues
describing the presence of gustducin-expressing cells in the
vomeronasal organ [29], which is a specialized part of the
olfactory system found in many vertebrates but absent in
adult humans. The gustducin-expressing cells in the
vomeronasal organ are scattered epithelial cells mainly
distributed along the incoming ducts of the organ and
within the non-sensory epithelium of the organ itself. The
morphology of these cells is similar to chemosensory cells
scattered within the epidermis of fishes as first described
by Mary Whitear in the 1960s [30] when she referred to
them as solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs).

Subsequently, we and others showed that SCCs are
present throughout the upper respiratory system and
express the entire suite of taste-related signaling mole-
cules, including T2R receptors, PLCβ2, gustducin, and
the transduction channel TrpM5 [9,20]. Finger et al. [9]
demonstrated that the taste signaling cascade is necessary

Figure 2. Sites in the body where cells express the canonical taste receptor cascade

Taste buds comprise three types of elongated cells, one of which (type II/receptor cells, identified by green fluorescence) expresses the taste receptor
(TR)-mediated transduction cascade culminating in activation of TrpM5. In the nasal cavity (top right), solitary chemosensory cells express the “taste”
transduction cascade and synapse onto nerve fibers (red) arising from the trigeminal nerve [9]. In the trachea (upper left), the “taste”-like cells are brush
cells, which release acetylcholine upon stimulation [40]. Some also make contacts with sensory nerve fibers (red) from the vagus nerve. In the stomach
(center lower right), a variety of enteroendocrine cells express elements of the taste transduction cascade [18,20,22] and release into the gut a variety of
peptide hormones. Numerous brush cells in the gall bladder and bile ducts express the canonical taste transduction cascade [15,20]; their function is
unknown. In the upper part of the small intestine (e.g., duodenum, lower right), a variety of enteroendocrine cells express taste receptors and the associated
downstream transduction cascade [16,17]. Some of these extend into the intestinal lumen while others do not. When activated, these cells release a variety of
gut peptides as discussed in the main text. Micrographs courtesy of Dr. Marco Tizzano.

for activation of the SCCs. Since the SCCs synapse onto
polymodal pain fibers of the trigeminal nerve, activation
of
the SCCs by bitter ligands evokes trigeminally-
mediated reflex changes in respiration. So inhalation of
a toxin that activates T2R receptors will be irritating and
will provoke reflex changes in respiration [11]—not a
sensation of taste. More recently, we showed that even
some bacterial metabolites and signal molecules can
activate the nasal SCCs and trigeminal nerve [11]. Since
the activated trigeminal nerve fibers release peptide
modulators (e.g., substance P or calcitonin gene-related
peptide), this causes local neurogenic inflammation of
the respiratory epithelium. In this way, SCCs act not only
as sentinels warning against inhalation of irritants, but
also as guardians capable of activating the innate
immune system to the presence of potentially damaging
toxins or pathogens.

In all of the examples presented so far, the taste signaling
cascade is used to detect elements in the lumen of an
organ (tongue, gut, respiratory passages), and to generate
an intracellular cascade to effect release of a neurotrans-
mitter or hormone to signal to other cells in the body.
Two recent reports on the expression of “taste” receptors
in the airways indicate that taste receptor signaling may
also operate in a cell-autonomous fashion,
is,
detection of the chemical directly affects function of
the responsive cell.

that

The first such report of a cell-autonomous effect of T2R
activation was in ciliated cells of human lower airways
[32]. Cultured human airway epithelium expresses some
T2Rs along with associated downstream elements.
Curiously though, the T2Rs are present on the cilia of
the ciliated epithelial cells with PLCβ2 situated where the
cilia insert into the cell body. In this scenario, the T2R-
mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ causes an increase
in ciliary beat frequency (Figure 1), which the authors
suggest would serve to sweep irritants away from the
surface of the cell. Whereas T2Rs can be detected in
cultured human airway cells, they are not detected in
the lower airways of mice [33]. Whether this represents
a species difference or the difference between in vivo
(mouse) and in vitro (human) states remains to be
determined.

The second report of T2Rs directing function within an
airway cell came from Deshpande and colleagues [34]
showing that smooth muscle cells of human airways
express T2R (bitter) taste receptors along with gustducin
and some components of
the taste-associated PLC
signaling cascade. Application of various bitter-tasting
substances to cultured human airway smooth muscle
cells produces PLC-dependent increases in intracellular

Ca2+ as would be typical of
taste cells or SCCs.
Surprisingly, these increases in intracellular Ca2+ are
reported to cause relaxation rather than contraction of
muscle, which is what is normally seen with increases in
intracellular Ca2+. This apparently paradoxical effect in
the airway smooth muscle cells is attributed to the
proximity of the T2R receptor complex to calcium-
activated big potassium (BKCa) channels (Figure 1),
which open in response to increased intracellular Ca2+.
Opening of the BKCa channels directly hyperpolarizes the
muscle cell leading to relaxation. In contrast, in taste cells
and SCCs, activation of the T2R receptor causes increased
intracellular Ca2+, as in the airway smooth muscle, but in
the sensory cells, the increased intracellular Ca2+ triggers
the transduction channel TrpM5 to depolarize the cell
and evoke transmitter release. Thus in different signaling
contexts, activation of the same receptor can produce
opposite cellular-level effects.
It should be noted,
however, that the findings of Deshpande and colleagues
[34] have since been questioned in terms of specificity
and mechanism; see [35,36].

Conclusions and future directions
The widespread expression of elements of the “taste”
transduction cascade in numerous tissues of the body
points out the necessity for caution in attributing a
physiological
function to a system based solely on
expression of a gene product. Activation of taste receptors
in taste buds does not give rise to the same sensation as
activation of the identical receptors in the airways or gut.
The physiological
function of a receptor, or a Trp
channel, or a G-protein, makes sense only in the context
in which it is expressed. So despite the title of this article,
“taste” receptors of the airway or gut really should not be
thought of as an internal sense of taste, but rather as an
entirely different chemoreceptor system.

is evident

While it
that “taste” receptors and their
associated downstream signaling components are widely
dispersed in diverse organ systems, the function of the
receptors in many tissues remains unclear despite recent
advances. For example, why should there be such a
prevalence of taste receptor-expressing brush cells in the
bile ducts [31,37]? The composition of the fluid in the
bile ducts is dictated by secretions of the liver, pancreas,
and gall bladder, so why is it necessary to diligently
monitor the composition of the biliary fluids as they
move from gall bladder to intestine?

Similarly enigmatic are the reported effects of T2R
(bitter) agonists on contractile elements of both the
airway and the gut. In the trachea, T2R agonists cause
muscle relaxation (see above) but it is not clear how a
bitter substance would have access to the smooth muscle

cells of the trachea under physiological conditions. The
smooth muscle of
the trachea is buried beneath a
relatively tight airway epithelium, and it is not obvious
how an inhaled bitter substance would penetrate the
epithelium to access T2R receptors on the muscle.
Similarly, the inhibition of smooth muscle contractility
by T2R agonists in the stomach is not mediated by any of
the peptides released by enterochromaffin cells of the gut
and may not even be mediated by T2R receptors. These
and other nonspecific effects of bitter ligands emphasize
the need to utilize either pharmacological agents or,
better still, knockout animals to establish the specificity
of transduction pathways and receptors for all physio-
logical effects. Hopefully future research will solve these
enigmas.
