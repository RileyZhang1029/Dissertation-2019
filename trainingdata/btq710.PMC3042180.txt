Summary: MADGene is a software environment comprising a webbased database and a java application.
This platform aims at unifying gene identifiers (ids) and performing gene set analysis.
MADGene allows the user to perform inter-conversion of clone and gene ids over a large range of nomenclatures relative to 17 species.
We propose a set of 23 functions to facilitate the analysis of gene sets and we give two microarray applications to show how MADGene can be used to conduct meta-analyses.
Availability: The MADGene resources are freely available online from http://www.madtools.org, a website dedicated to the analysis and annotation of DNA microarray data.
