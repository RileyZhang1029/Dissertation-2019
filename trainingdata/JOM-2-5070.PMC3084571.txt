Objective: Secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (SLPI), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2
(SCCA1 and SCCA2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that
prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. To determine the
effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells
(GECs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants of various periopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
Design: The gene expression and secretion of SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were determined using real-
time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The direct effects of periopathogens and P. gingivalis gingipain mutants
on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by Western Blot. The effect on the innate immune response of
GECs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hBD2) and chemokine
(C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20).
Results: We found that SLPI, SCCA2, elafin, hBD2, and CCL20 gene expression levels were significantly
induced (pB0.001) in response to P. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in
response to stimulation by other bacteria. P. gingivalis reduced the secretion of SLPI and elafin significantly
in GECs, and degraded recombinant SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2. Differential degradation patterns of
SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were observed with different bacteria as well as P. gingivalis mutants
associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by P. gingivalis. In addition, pretreatment of GECs with
SLPI, SCCA1, or SCCA2 partially blocked hBD2 and CCL20 mRNA expression in response to P. gingivalis,
suggesting a protective effect.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the host protease inhibitors in a different
manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. The balance between
cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal
infection.

Periodontal disease is an inflammatory disorder

caused by Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that
affects tooth-supporting structures (1). The devel-
opment and progression of this disease occurs from
complex interactions between oral microflora and the
host, affected by multiple factors, such as smoking, stress,
illness, and genetic susceptibility (2). A number of
emerging studies have reported that chronic periodontal
disease could increase the incidence of various systemic
diseases and conditions, such as preterm birth (3),
cardiovascular disease (4), and respiratory infection (5).

Thus, periodontal disease is not just an oral health
problem, but a significant health risk. Although the
strategies for prevention and therapies for periodontal
disease have improved recently, effective prevention and
treatment is still a challenge. Therefore, better under-
standing of mechanisms responsible for host defense
responses against various periopathogens will contribute
to developing effective future therapeutic strategies.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a close associa-
tion between the pathology of periodontitis and develop-
ment of a subgingival biofilm that includes Porphyromonas

gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter actinomy-
cetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, and Fusobacterium
nucleatum (6, 7). However, the pathogenesis of period-
ontal disease is by no means fully elucidated. These
putative pathogens produce a broad array of potential
virulence factors:
fimbriae,
hemagglutinin, hemolysins, and gingipains from P. gin-
givalis (811); trypsin-like protease (12), sialidase (13),
and hemagglutinin (14) from T. forsythia; and chymo-
trypsin-like enzyme and metalloproteases (15) from T.
denticola and A. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively.
These virulence factors contribute to the pathogenicity
of these organisms and stimulate host cells to release
inflammatory mediators that may actually promote the
progression of disease (9). Specifically, P. gingivalis-
derived gingipains (cysteine proteases) which include
two arginine residue-specific enzymes, RgpA and RgpB,
and a lysine residue-specific enzyme, termed Kgp (1618),
have been shown to exert pathophysiological effects
through cleavage or degradation of host proteins, such
as CD14 on human monocytes
(19) and gingival
fibroblasts (20), ICAM-1 on human oral epithelial
cells (21), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor
(SLPI) in gingival tissue of periodontitis associated with
P. gingivalis infection (22).

inhibitors contributes

Serine protease inhibitors play a critical role in host
tissue homeostasis and the balance between proteases
to maintenance of
and their
tissue integrity (23). As previously explained,
that
gingival epithelial cells (GECs) exposed to a cell wall
preparation of F. nucleatum (FnCW) upregulated ex-
pression of multiple protease inhibitors as well as
antimicrobial peptides and other potentially protective
factors (24). The protease inhibitors elafin (or Skin-
derived anti-leukoprotease), SLPI, SERPINB3 (or squa-
mous cell carcinoma antigen SCCA1), and SERPINB4
(SCCA2) were among the most highly upregulated
genes upon F. nucleatum exposure. These protease
inhibitors potentially target
two kinds of proteases,
host cell-derived proteases such as neutrophil elastase,
and pathogen-derived proteases such as the gingipains,
and therefore may be important
in controlling the
extent of inflammatory tissue damage (22, 25). How-
ever, it is not clear how epithelial expression of these
multiple protease inhibitors is modulated by various
oral microorganisms, and how they might function in
the complex environment of
the periodontium. We
hypothesized that various oral Gram-negative bacteria
have differing effects on the expression and function of
host protease inhibitors, and the effects could alter the
balance between proteases and their inhibitors, thus
might have an impact on pathogenesis of periodontal
disease.

Materials and methods

Cysteine protease inhibitor tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl
ketone (TLCK) was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Recombinant human SLPI and elafin (trappin-2),
and anti-human elafin were purchased from R&D
Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human
SCCA1, SCCA2, and anti-SCCA1 and anti-SCCA2
were prepared as described previously (26, 27). Anti-
human SLPI was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibody anti-rabbit
IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and
anti-mouse IgG HRP were purchased from Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ) and Santa Cruz

Human primary GECs and bacteria culture
Gingival biopsies were obtained from healthy patients
who underwent third-molar extraction in the Depart-
ment of Oral Surgery, School of Dentistry, University
of Washington,
in accordance with a University of
Washington Institutional Review Board-approved study.
The tissue was prepared for cell culture as described
previously (28). Epithelial cells were cultured in keratino-
cyte growth medium (KGM) with 0.15 mM Ca2 using
the supplements from the KGM-bullet kit (Cambrex,
Walkersville, MD) at 378C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in
Table 1. P. gingivalis wild-type and mutant strains were
cultured under anaerobic conditions (85% N2, 10% H2,
and 5% CO2) at 378C in Trypticase soy broth (BBL,
Sparks, MD) supplemented with 1 g of yeast extract,
5 mg of hemin, and 1 mg of menadione per liter.
Appropriate antibiotics previously described were added
to each culture of mutant of P. gingivalis (29, 30).
A. actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 700685) and F. nucle-
atum (ATCC 25586) were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth
supplemented with 1 g of yeast extract per 100 ml at 378C
under anaerobic conditions. T. forsythia (ATCC 49610)
was grown in 5% blood agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, KS)
with a N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) disk, and then
bacteria were scraped from the agar surface using sterile
cotton swabs and subcultured in heart infusion broth
media (BBL, sparks, MD) supplemented with hemin,
vitamin K, and l-cysteine under anaerobic conditions at
378C (31). Bacterial purity was determined by micro-
scopy and Gram staining, and numbers were estimated by
absorbance measurement using the TECAN GENios
Multidetection Reader, V.4.51 (Phoenix, Hayward, CA).
The bacteria were cultured to late logarithmic growth
phase. Cell-free Bacterial supernatants were collected

Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from GECs using RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen, CA) by standard procedures. cDNA was
prepared from 0.5 mg of
total RNA by standard
techniques. Quantitative analysis of
the cDNA was
performed using iCycler (Bio-Rad, CA) and iQ5 accord-
ing to the manufacturer‚Äôs
instructions. Quantitative
real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was conducted with SYBR
Green Supermix kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). The
amplification conditions were initial denaturation at 958C
for 12 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 958C
for 30 s, annealing at 57658C for 30 s, and elongation
at 728C for 60 s. Melt-curve analysis was performed
to confirm that the signal was that of the expected
amplification product and not possible primerdimers.
The sequences of oligonucleotide primers for human
beta-defenisin-2 (hBD2), CCL20, SLPI, elafin, SCCA1
and SCCA2, and the calculation for relative fold changes
were described previously (24).

Cytokine secretion assay
Cell culture supernatants after various stimulations were
collected and the levels of the indicated proteins were
measured with ELISA kits for SLPI and elafin (R&D
Systems, MN) in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs
protocol. For DuoSet ELISA elafin, the detection limits
of the assay for elafin in culture supernatants was 31.2 pg/
ml. Intra-assay variation measured by repetitive testing in
our laboratory was around 9.0 (CV%), while inter-assay
variation was 10.0 (CV%). For Quantikine ELISA SLPI,
the detection limits was 25 pg/ml, with intra-assay
variation around 8.0 (CV%) and inter-assay variation

around 8.0 (CV%). A standard curve was generated with
each set of samples assayed. The linear region of the
standard curve was obtained by a series of 2-fold
dilutions in reagent diluents. The absorbance of the
blank control (reagent diluents) was subtracted from
the measured absorbance of the different standards and
samples. Final concentrations in each sample were
calculated as the mean of the results at the proper sample
dilution yielding absorbance in the linear parts of the
standard curves. Supernatants of cells from three differ-
ent donors were tested, with duplicate samples from each
donor.

Western Blotting
Recombinant SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were
incubated at room temperature (RT) for 15 min with the
indicated dilutions of P. gingivalis supernatants in a
standard buffer (0.2 mM Tris, 0.1 mM NaCl, 5 mM
CaCl2, and pH 7.6) freshly supplemented with 10 mM
cysteine (32). After incubation, samples were immedi-
ately denatured in SDS reducing buffer at 708C for 10
min and separated by Nu-PAGE Bistris Gel (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA). Heat-denatured samples treated
with or without protease inhibitors cocktail
(Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for detection of
elafin and SLPI showed no difference using Western
Blot. Primary antibodies used were anti-SLPI (Rabbit
polyclonal antibody; 1:200 dilution), anti-elafin (Rabbit
polyclonal antibody; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-SCCA1 and
anti-SCCA2 (mouse monoclonal; SCCA1, 1:2,500 dilu-
tion; SCCA2, 1:1,500 dilution). Secondary antibody was
anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated antibody for SLPI;
anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated antibody for SCCA1
and SCCA2. The signals were detected by chemilumi-
nescence‚Äôs (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL)
and exposure to Kodak X-ray film.

Data analysis
Each experiment was performed with GECs from differ-
ent donors, and within an experiment, each test condition
was performed in duplicate. Values are shown as the

one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) among the
groups followed by the two-tailed t-test. All statistical

be statistically significant at the cut-off level of pB0.05.

Results

SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 gene expression in
GECs is induced by P. gingivalis, but not by other
bacteria
Gene expression of protease inhibitors SLPI, elafin,
SCCA1, and SCCA2 was evaluated by using QRT-PCR
after stimulation of GECs with the cell-free culture
supernatants of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, or A. actino-
to MOI 100 for 24 h.
mycetemcomitans equivalent
(rgpA/rgpB) and
P. gingivalis KDP112 mutant
F. nucleatum were used as control bacteria. TLCK, an
inhibitor of the active sites of serine/cysteine proteases,
pre-incubated with P. gingivalis supernatants served as an
additional control. Wild-type P. gingivalis significantly
induced mRNA expression of all four protease inhibitors
(pB0.001) compared to the unstimulated control and all
other treatments (Fig. 1). T. forsythia, F. nucleatum,
A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis KDP112 and
TLCK-treated P. gingivalis did not show any effects on
the induction of SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 gene

expressions in GECs (inset Fig. 1). These results suggest
that the importance of P. gingivalis in the induction of
epithelial protease inhibitors.

We next examined the secreted levels of protease inhibitor
proteins in GEC culture media in response to the cell-free
supernatants of various periodontal pathogens using
ELISA. We tested SLPI and elafin levels, since ELISA
kits for SCCA were not available commercially. The levels
of secreted SLPI and elafin were not significantly changed
compared to the unstimulated control
in response to
T. forsythia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum,
and the P. gingivalis (rgpA/rgpB) mutant. TLCK
pre-incubated with P. gingivalis supernatants also showed
similar secreted levels of SLPI and elafin as the control.
However, the levels of secreted SLPI and elafin were
significantly decreased in response to wild-type P.
gingivalis (Fig. 2A). The decrease in the secreted level of
SLPI and elafin was verified by comparing effects of cell-
free supernatants of P. gingivalis and whole bacterial
cultures of P. gingivalis at the equivalent MOI (Fig. 2B).
No significant difference was seen in GECs stimulated by
the cell-free supernatants and whole bacterial culture.
Secreted SLPI and elafin were only detectable with the
lowest dose (MOI 10). Both SLPI and elafin were secreted
by GECs in the absence of stimulants in a time-dependent
manner from 2 to 48 h (Fig. 2C). The secreted levels of
SLPI and elafin were very low in response to P. gingivalis
(insets in Fig. 2C and D) and apparent loss of secreted

protein occurred as early as 2 h post-stimulation com-
pared to the corresponding control. The secreted levels of
SLPI and elafin differed between different batches of
P. gingivalis used, but the trend remained the same.

We next tested if the proteases secreted by P. gingivalis
directly affect the protease inhibitors in vitro. Recombi-
nant SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were incubated
with various dilutions of bacterial supernatants at RT for
15 min and analyzed by Western Blot using specific
antibodies under reducing conditions. Each recombinant
protease inhibitor was cleaved in response to dilutions of
P. gingivalis supernatants in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3). With undiluted P. gingivalis supernatants, the
recombinant proteins were completely degraded follow-
ing 15 min incubation. The protease inhibitors remained
intact or nearly so when P. gingivalis supernatant was
diluted to 1,000-fold. Supernatants of T. forsythia had no
effect on recombinant elafin and SLPI at all dilutions,
but slightly degraded SCCA1 and SCCA2 at 1 and
30 dilutions. The degree of degradation was less than
shown with P. gingivalis. Supernatants of F. nucleatum
and A. actinomycetemcomitans had no effect on recom-
binant elafin, SLPI, SCCA1, and SCCA2 at all dilutions
tested.

Differential degradation of SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and
SCCA2 by P. gingivalis gingipains
To determine whether
the gingipains produced by
P. gingivalis were responsible for the degradation of these
protease inhibitors, we analyzed SLPI and elafin degrada-
tion in cell culture media by P. gingivalis supernatants
alone and in the presence of TLCK, an inhibitor of the
active sites of serine/cysteine proteases. Media from GECs
cultured for 24 h and containing secreted SLPI and elafin
were collected and incubated with P. gingivalis super-
natants (1:10 dilution) in the presence of various concen-
trations of TLCK (0.12512.5 mM) for 20 min at RT, and
assayed for the remaining SLPI and elafin by ELISA. The
SLPI and elafin concentrations decreased to 29% and 10%
of
the control, respectively, when incubated with P.
gingivalis supernatants only (Fig. 4A). The degradation
of both SLPI and elafin was blocked by TLCK in a dose-
dependent manner. Thus, the degradation of these pro-
tease inhibitors is serine/cysteine protease-dependent.

SLPI and elafin degradation was prevented when
P. gingivalis was heat-killed at 658C for 60 min prior to
incubating with GECs (Fig. 4B). The heat sensitivity of
degradation supports the enzymatic degradation of these
protease inhibitors.

100; increasing dilution factor is indicated below each protease inhibitor. Protein mixtures were denatured at 708C for 10 min,
separated by electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western Blot. Control: control, recombinant protein only. The controls shown
with P. gingivalis also apply to the recombinant proteins treated with T. forsythia and F. nucleatum.

In order to identify the role of each gingipain in
degradation of
these protease inhibitors, we further
utilized isogenic mutant strains of P. gingivalis lacking
one or more combinations of proteases compared with
the corresponding wild-type strain (Table 1). Cell-free
supernatants of various mutants and the corresponding
wild-type were incubated with recombinant elafin, SLPI,
SCCA1 or SCCA2, and analyzed by Western Blots
(Fig. 4C). Elafin, SLPI, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were
significantly degraded by undiluted supernatants of
wild-type W83 and 33277 P. gingivalis. Different wild-
types (W83 and 33277) showed different potency against
elafin. The mutant
lacking lysine-specific gingipain
(V2577, kgp) and another mutant lacking both argi-
nine- and lysine-specific gingipains (V2383, rgpA/
kgp) showed minimal degradation of elafin by un-
diluted supernatants, compared to the corresponding
wild-type W83 and control (Fig. 4C). Less difference
was seen between the mutant lacking rgpA/rgpB
(KDP112) and the respective wild-type 33277. These
results indicate that the isoform Kgp is mainly respon-
sible for the degradation of elafin although the combina-
tion of RgpB and RgpA may have a synergistic effect on
elafin degradation. The mutant lacking the lysine-specific
gingipain V2577 (kgp) cleaved SLPI, while the one
lacking both arginine-specific
gingipains KDP112
(rgpA/rgpB) showed reduced ability to degrade
SLPI, compared with the respective wild-type. The
rgpA/kgp mutant (V2383) did not degrade recombi-
nant SLPI. All these data suggest the degradation of
SLPI is mainly RgpA-specific (Fig. 4C). The lysine-
specific mutant V2577 (kgp) and arginine-,
lysine-
specific double mutant V2383 (rgpA/kgp) cleaved

both SCCA1 and SCCA2, similar to the corresponding
wild-type. However, the double mutant (rgpA/rgpB)
was unable to completely cleave either SCCA1 or
SCCA2, suggesting the importance of RgpB in the
degradation of SCCA1 and SCCA2. The data indicate
different susceptibility patterns of these protease inhibi-
tors to different gingipain isoforms, however, all of these
protease inhibitors are degraded by one or more gingi-
pains.

Functional effects of protease inhibitors on innate
immune responses in GECs
In order to investigate changes in the expression of innate
immune markers in response to changes in protease and/
or protease inhibitor levels, we evaluated the gene
expression of antimicrobial proteins hBD2 and CCL20
using QRT-PCR after stimulation of GECs with cell-free
supernatants of P. gingivalis for 24 h (Fig. 5A and B) and
whole bacterial cultures (data not shown). P. gingivalis
supernatant-induced hBD2 and CCL20 at MOI equiva-
lent to 100 and 200. We pretreated cells with recombinant
SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, or SCCA2 at various concentra-
tions for 1 h and then added P. gingivalis supernatants
(MOI: 100) or supernatants plus TLCK for 24 h. The
recombinant protease inhibitors alone did not alter
the expression of hBD2 and CCL20 (data not shown).
P. gingivalis-induced expression of hBD2 and CCL20 in
GECs was reduced nearly to the unstimulated baseline
level when TLCK was added (Fig. 5CF). Pre-incubation
of the supernatants with SLPI and SCCA1 partially
blocked P. gingivalis-induced hBD2 expression compared
with P. gingivalis alone (pB0.05). Similarly, pre-incuba-
tion with SLPI, SCCA1, and SCCA2 blocked expression

the results are representative of

Effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors

of CCL20 compared with P. gingivalis alone (pB0.05),
while no significant alteration of hBD2 and CCL20
expression was found with elafin pre-incubation. The
effect of these protease inhibitors to block innate immune
responses in GECs suggests a protective role against
P. gingivalis. In contrast, the protective effect of these
inhibitors was lost when P. gingivalis supernatant was
pretreated with any one of the four protease inhibitors
then added to the cells, possibly due to degradation of the
protease inhibitors by P. gingivalis supernatants (data not
shown). The degree of hBD2 and CCL20 induction
varied between cells from different donors, but the trend
remained the same.

Discussion
In our attempt
to compare differential effects of
Gram-negative periodontal pathogens on host protease
inhibitors, we observed that only P. gingivalis degraded
multiple host protease inhibitors, such as SLPI, elafin,
SCCA1, and SCCA2. Our data provide the strong
evidence that P. gingivalis proteases, the gingipains, are
implicated in the degradation of protease inhibitors and
these degradation patterns are specific to gingipain
isoforms.

Periodontitis is strongly associated with a complex of
microbial species within the biofilm, suggesting that
multiple microorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis
of chronic periodontal disease. These putative period-
ontal pathogens express a variety of proteolytic enzymes
which may be involved in the processes of periodontal
disease (33, 34). The best characterized of these are
gingipains from P. gingivalis (18, 35), but in addition,
T. forsythia has a sialidase enzyme (13), T. denticola has a
chymotrypsin-like enzyme, A. actinomycetemcomitans has
metalloproteases (15), and F. nucleatum has hyaluroni-
dase and chondroitinase activities (36). All these enzymes
are released into gingival crevicular fluid (37). Therefore,
it was of interest to us to explore the effect of various oral
pathogens on epithelial protease inhibitors.

In this study, we observed that four epithelial protease
inhibitors are significantly upregulated at the mRNA level
only by P. gingivalis supernatants, however, the secreted
protein level does not reflect mRNA level, suggesting
rapid degradation in the culture media. This degradation
was partially or largely blocked by TLCK, an inhibitor of
gingipains. In addition, P. gingivalis supernatant was
effective in degrading the four recombinant protease
inhibitors. P. gingivalis-derived gingipains have been
shown to cleave or degrade several types of host proteins
and fit into the class of pathogenic bacteria in which
proteases have multiple potent deleterious effects on
innate immune responses as recently reviewed (38).
Gingipains alter cell adhesion allowing bacterial penetra-
tion into the tissue (21), destroy protective innate immune

Fig. 5. Functional effects of protease inhibitors on innate immune responses of GECs. (A and B) The fold change for hBD2 (A)
and CCL20 (B) mRNA expression was evaluated by QRT-PCR after GECs were stimulated for 24 h with P. gingivalis
supernatants at increasing MOI equivalents. hBD2 and CCL20 mRNA levels were compared with unstimulated control (unÔ¨Ålled
bar) after normalization with the housekeeping gene ribosomal phosphoprotein (RPO). Data show means9SEM (standard
error of the mean) for three donors evaluated in duplicate. (*) indicates the signiÔ¨Åcant difference versus the respective
unstimulated control (pB0.01). (CF) SLPI, elaÔ¨Ån, SCCA1, and SCCA2 partially attenuated mRNA gene expression of hBD2

incubated with the indicated concentration of recombinant SLPI, elaÔ¨Ån, SCCA1 or SCCA2 at 378C for 1 h, then exposed to
P. gingivalis supernatants (MOI equivalent 100) for 24 h. Data are from duplicate samples using GECs from three donors. The
gene expression of hBD2 and CCL20 varied between different batches of P. gingivalis or primary cells from different donors
used, but the trend remained the same. Controls without protease inhibitor pre-incubation include unstimulated GECs (unÔ¨Ålled
bars); GECs stimulated with P. gingivalis supernatants (Pg Sup) (black bars) and with P. gingivalis supernatants (Pg Sup) plus

responses including the antimicrobial peptides a- and b-
defensins (39), and suppress expression of IL-8 (40), thus
hindering the role of neutrophils that are the first line of
essential host defense against invading pathogens in the
gingival sulcus (41). Our results show that yet another
protective epithelial innate immune response, the expres-
sion and function of multiple protease inhibitors, is altered
by P. gingivalis. In addition, our preliminary data (data not
shown) utilizing siRNA showed that the induction of gene
expression of all four protease inhibitors was associated

with protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G-protein-
coupled receptor activated by P. gingivalis proteases,
further suggesting the role of gingipains in the regulation
of protease inhibitors.

Serine protease inhibitors target multiple proteases and
are involved in multiple immunomodulatory functions,
for example, to trigger keratinocyte proliferation and
differentiation as well as leukocyte attraction and activa-
tion (23, 42). Despite the crucial importance of protease
inhibitors in immune modulation, little is known about

their role in periodontal health. SLPI is constitutively
produced at many mucosal surfaces and by neutrophils
and macrophages (43), while elafin is mainly induced in
skin (44, 45) or lung epithelium (46) under inflammatory
conditions. In addition to their activity as protease
inhibitors, SLPI and elafin have antimicrobial activity
against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens (47, 48),
anti-HIV-1 activity (42, 49, 50), and anti-inflammatory
functions (47, 5154). SCCA1 and SCCA2, members of
the ovalbumin-serpin family of serine protease inhibitors,
have been reported to be co-expressed widely in normal
epithelial tissues, such as tonsil, airway, vagina, uterine
cervix, and keratinocytes (55, 56). Both SCCA1 and
SCCA2 are detected normally in the cytoplasm of
squamous epithelial cells (55) and inhibit serine proteases
of endogenous origin, such as cathepsin G and chymase,
as well as extrinsic origin such as cysteine proteases
derived from house dust mites (57, 58). SCCAs, as
primarily intracellular serine protease inhibitors, might
act on proteases from P. gingivalis after it
invades
epithelial cells.

It is emerging that a number of diseases are associated
with an imbalance between proteases and their specific
inhibitors. These imbalances may be due to excess
protease secreted by bacterial infection or by inflamma-
tory cells. For example, the increased matrix metallopro-
teinase (MMP) or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
(TIMP) ratio was reported to be associated with period-
ontitis (59), cardiovascular disease (60), and lung disease
(61). When the ratio of protease to protease inhibitor
favors the proteases (excess protease); the proteases may
alter the immunomodulatory properties of the inhibitors
or cleave the inhibitor as shown for elafin when com-
plexed with neutrophil elastase (62). The results of the
present study demonstrated degradation of SLPI, elafin,
SCCA1, and SCCA2 by the oral pathogen P. gingivalis in
addition to SLPI, as previously reported (22); this would
be expected to change the ratio of proteases and their
inhibitors as P. gingivalis infection is established and
progresses. Reduction of serine protease inhibitor secre-
tion has been previously related to bacterial infection.
For example, SLPI was reduced in vaginal secretions and
sputum (63) in the presence of bacterial infection. Elafin
has been found in lower levels in P. aeruginosa-positive
as opposed to P. aeruginosa-negative sputum in cystic
fibrosis patients. Our study is the first to show differential
degradation of host SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 by
various major periodontal pathogens. We suggest that
this reduction in host protective capacity contributes to
increased susceptibility to inflammatory periodontal
disease once P. gingivalis becomes a component of the
subgingival biofilm.

Our previous study showed that the multiple protease
inhibitors were induced by cell wall preparation of
F. nucleatum, but this phenomenon was not observed

Effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors

by live F. nucleatum in this study, possibly due to a dose
effect. Live bacterial culture of F. nucleatum exhibits
plasmin protease activity (64, 65), which may also
influence the expression of those protease inhibitors.
T. forsythia, whose main virulence factor is a trypsin-
like protease, slightly degraded SCCA1 and SCCA2 in
this study. Thus, a main player in the pathogenesis of
T. forsythia may not be a protease, but the organism‚Äôs
ability to penetrate host cells or induce apoptosis (66).

By utilizing protease mutants of P. gingivalis we gained
information about the type of gingipain that degrades
each of the host protease inhibitors tested. Our results
suggest that Kgp is mainly responsible for elafin degra-
dation, with some contribution from RgpB. Our data are
comparable to a recent finding by Kantyka et al. that
compared the anti-human neutrophil elastase activity
of elafin in the presence P. gingivalis gingipains. In
Kantyka‚Äôs study, all three gingipains (RgpA, RgpB, and
Kgp) were found to degrade elafin, with RgpB being the
most efficient gingipain (67). Furthermore, in our study,
RgpA is most effective in degrading SLPI, which is
consistent with the findings of Into et al. (22). RgpB is
most effective in degrading SCCA1 and SCCA2, how-
ever, SLPI, SCCA1, and SCCA2 are all slightly suscep-
tible to cleavage by Kgp as indicated by their reduction in
stability in the double mutants KDP112 (rgpA/
rgpB). The different susceptibility patterns are un-
doubtedly due to specific cleavage sites within the
protease inhibitors. We also sought to determine if the
protease inhibitors have an effect on the response of
GECs to P. gingivalis, in other words, do these protease
inhibitors function in a protective manner for epithelial
cells? Our preliminary data found that SLPI inhibits the
proteolytic activity of P. gingivalis supernatants in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (data not shown).
Furthermore, we also found that pretreatment of GECs
with SLPI, SCCA1, and SCCA2 resulted in reduced
expression of ‚Äòalarm‚Äô signals hBD2 and CCL20 gene
expression when these cells were exposed to P. gingivalis.
This is possibly due to the protease inhibitors influencing
inflammatory signaling pathways. For example, SLPI has
been found to suppress NF-kB activation, elafin has been
shown to inhibit LPS-induced MCP-1 in monocytes by
inhibiting AP-1 and NF-kB activation, and SCCAs
specifically suppress the kinase activity of JNK1 (51,
68, 69). The pretreatment with those inhibitors might
attenuate inflammatory responses.

The progress of periodontal disease is associated with
an increased proteolytic activity in gingival sites (33, 34).
These proteases originate from both host-derived inflam-
mation and periopathogens, and contribute to the patho-
genesis of periodontal disease. Within the complex dental
biofilm, it is important to define which putative perio-
pathogens are dominant in the destruction of periodontal
tissue during the chronic inflammation. In this study,

we have found that P. gingivalis was most effective at
degradation of multiple host proteases inhibitors and this
may be due to the fact that P. gingivalis has most protease
activity and a greater number of proteases than any of the
other bacteria, as reviewed by Eley and Cox (37). The
cleavage of these protease inhibitors is not essential for
the survival of periopathogens, but their loss could make
the host more susceptible to progressive infection. An
extensive review of effects of bacterial proteases on
innate immunity categorizes deleterious effects on cyto-
kines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, complement,
and inflammatory signaling pathways (38). The present
study demonstrates that the balance of proteases and
their inhibitors may also be an important factor in the
innate immune response and provide initial evidence for
the development of preventive therapies for chronic
periodontal disease using protease inhibitors.
