Spores  of  Aspergillus  sp.  SU14  were  treated  repeatedly  and  sequentially  with  Co60  γ-rays,  ultraviolet  irradiation,  and  N-
methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.  One  selected  mutant  strain,  Aspergillus  sp.  SU14-M15,  produced  cellulase  in  a  yield  2.2-
fold  exceeding  that  of  the  wild  type.  Optimal  conditions  for  the  production  of  cellulase  by  the  mutant  fungal  strain  using
solid-state  fermentation  were  examined.  The  medium  consisted  of  wheat-bran  supplemented  with  1%  (w/w)  urea  or  NH4Cl,
1%  (w/w)  rice  starch,  2.5 mM  MgCl2,  and  0.05%  (v/w)  Tween  80.  Optimal  moisture  content  and  initial  pH  was  50%  (v/w)
and  3.5,  respectively,  and  optimal  aeration  area  was  3/100  (inoculated  wheat  bran/container).  The  medium  was  inoculated
with  25%  48 hr  seeding  culture  and  fermented  at  35oC  for  3  days.  The  resulting  cellulase  yield  was  8.5-fold  more  than  that
of  the  wild  type  strain  grown  on  the  basal  wheat  bran  medium.

The  need  for  utilizing  renewable  resources  to  meet  the
future  demand  for  fuel  has  increased  the  attention  on  cel-
lulose,  the  most  abundant  and  renewable  resource  in  the
world.  Cellulose  is  degraded  by  cellulases  to  reducing
sugars  and  is  fermented  by  yeast  or  bacteria  to  ethanol
[1],  which  is  an  attractive  alternative  fuel  to  petroleum.
Ethanol  production  from  glucose  is  most  commonly  car-
ried  out  by  the  yeast  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  [2]  and
the  bacterium  Zymomonas  mobilis  [3],  with  another  yeast
species,  Brettanomyces  custersii,  being  useful  in  ethanol
production  from  cellobiose  [4].  Cellulases  are  produced
by  various  fungi  and  bacteria.  Trichoderma  reesei  is  a
popular source of commercial cellulose, as it displays high
cellulose  activity,  owing  to  the  high  protein  secretion
capacity  of  mutant  strains  obtained  by  random  mutagene-
sis  [5].  Aspergillus  sp.  also  has  been  widely  exploited  for
production of cellulases [6, 7].

During  ethanol  production  from  lignocellulosics,  cellu-
lases  play  a  very  important  role  in  the  cellulose  digestion
process.  However,  the  very  prohibitive  cost  of  cellulases
due  to  the  large  amounts  required  for  cellulose  digestion
hinders their widespread use [1, 8]. Reduced cost of cellu-
lase production, improved cellulase activity and an increase
in sugar yields are all vital to reducing the processing costs
of bioethanol from cellulosic substrates [9].

Mutagenic  agents  can  achieve  strain  improvement [10].
Treatment  of  Fusarium  oxysporum  with  ultraviolet  (UV)

radiation  followed  by  N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
(NTG)  has  been  used  to  improve  cellulase  production
[11].  The  simultaneous  treatment  of  a  fungus  with  NTG,
UV and NTG combined with Co60 γ-rays created a mutant
that  more  exuberantly  produced  cellulose  [12].  Both  solid
and  liquid  fermentation  systems  have  been  used  for  the
production  of  cellulases.  Solid  state  fermentation  (SSF)  is
a process in which an insoluble substrate is fermented with
sufficient  moisture  but  without  free  water.  The  advantages
of  SSF  compared  to  submerged  liquid  fermentation  are
numerous  and  include  ease  of  use,  lower  capital  cost,
superior  productivity,  reduced  energy  requirement,  use  of
simpler  fermentation  media,  absence  of  rigorous  control
of  fermentation  parameters,  reduced  water  requirement,
reduced  produced  of  wastewater,  easier  control  of  bacte-
rial  contamination  and  lower  cost  for  downstream  pro-
cessing [13, 14].

To  date,  research  concerning  strain  improvement  and
optimization  of  culture  conditions  has  been  done  separately.
To  maximize  cellulase  production,  strain  improvement  and
optimization  of  culture  conditions  should  be  performed
consequently.  With  this  knowledge,  the  present  study  sought
to  modify  a  fungal  strain  and  optimize  solid  medium  and
culture conditions to enhance cellulose production.

nally  isolated  from  soil  was  used.  The  frozen  culture
stored  at  −80oC  was  streaked  on  potato  dextrose  agar
(PDA, 2% agar) and cultured at 30oC for 4~7 days.

Fungal  strain  improvement  by  mutagenesis. The  spores
of  fungal  strain  SU14  (108 spores/mL)  were  harvested
from  6-day-old  spores  grown  on  PDA  following  expo-
sure  to  different  doses  (0.5~2.5 KGy)  of  Co60  γ-rays.  The
survivors  were  grown  by  spreading  0.1 mL  of  treated
spores on PDA containing 0.1% (w/v) cellulose azure and
incubating  at  30oC  for  4~7  days.  Mutants  evident  by  the
presence  of  large  clear  zones  around  the  colonies  were
selected  and  re-irradiated  with  Co60  γ-rays.  The  best-sur-
viving mutant was then exposed to UV radiation (30 W at
a  distance  of  50 cm  for  2~60 min;  present  modifications)
[11].  The  selected  UV  mutant  was  treated  with  NTG
(100 µg/mL  in  0.2 M  citrate  buffer  solution,  pH  5)  using
four  cycles  of  10~60 min  each.  The  mutant  spores  were
washed  four  times  with  saline  solution  and  spread  on
PDA  as  described  above.  After  treatment  with  various
mutagenic  agents,  500  mutant  strains  were  picked  up  and
screened.  The  mutant  strain  that  was  superior  in  cellular
production,  which  was  designated  SU14-M15,  was  used
for further study.

Preparation of seeding culture. Ten grams of wheat bran
powder  and  90 mL  distilled  water  in  a  250 mL  Erlenm-
eyer  flask  (final  pH  3.5),  was  sterilized  at  121oC  for
20 min,  and  then  cooled.  To  this,  one  plug  (1 × 1 cm2)  of
7-day-old  conidia-mycelia  were  inoculated  and  incubated
at  30oC  in  an  orbital  shaking  incubator  operating  at  200
rpm for 1 day.

Solid  state  fermentation  (SSF). A  500 mL  Erlenmeyer
flask  containing  20 g  of  wheat  bran  with  33.3%  moisture
was  plugged  with  cotton  and  sterilized  for  20  min  at
121oC.  After  cooling,  10%  of  a  1-day-old  liquid  culture
was inoculated and incubated at 30oC for 3 days.

Preparation  of  crude  cellulase. The  moldy  wheat-bran
that  developed  after  3  days  of  fermentation  was  mixed
with  distilled  water  at  a  1 : 50  (w/v)  ratio.  The  mixture
was shaken at 30oC for 1 hr in an orbital shaker operating
at  200 rpm.  The  supernatant  obtained  after  centrifugation
of the mixture at 7,000 rpm for 10 min was used as crude
enzyme source.

Cellulase  activity  assay. The  activity  of  cellulase  was
determined as previously detailed [15]. The 1 mL enzyme
reaction  mixture  was  composed  of  0.5 mL  of  diluted
enzyme  and  0.5 mL  of  1%  (w/v)  carboxymethyl  cellulose
(CMC;  Sigma,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA)  in  acetate  buffer
(50 mM,  pH  5).  The  reaction  mixture  was  incubated  at
50oC  for  30 min  and  the  released  reducing  sugar  was

determined  by  the  3,5-dinitrosalicylic  acid  method  [16].  One
unit  (U)  of  enzyme  activity  was  defined  as  the  amount  of
enzyme  required  to  liberate  1 µM  of  glucose  from  CMC
per min under the assay conditions. Cellulase activity was
expressed  as  unit  per  1 g  of  fermented  solid  wheat  bran
(U/g).

Optimization  of  SSF. SSF  was  carried  out  to  study  the
effect of various physico-chemical parameters required for
the  maximal  production  of  cellulase  by  SU14-M15.  The
parameters that were optimized were substrate (wheat bran,
husk,  saw  dust),  moisture  (20~80%  v/w,  where  v  and  w
represent  water  and  water  +  dried  wheat  bran,  respec-
tively),  incubation  temperature  (20~45oC),  pH  of  solid
culture  (3~7),  incubation  time  (2~6  days),  aeration  area
(15~45 g  of  moistened  wheat  bran  in  a  500 mL  Erlenm-
eyer flask, age of liquid culture (1~4 days), inoculum size
(10~50%,  v/w).  Studies  were  also  conducted  to  examine
the effect on cellulose production of various additives sup-
plemented  into  wheat  bran  solid  culture.  The  examined
additives  were  carbon  sources  (glucose,  maltose,  rice
starch,  sucrose,  and  corn  starch;  at  1%  w/w);  nitrogen
sources  (urea,  yeast  extract,  tryptone,  tryptic  soy,  peptone,
nutrient  broth,  skim  milk,  casamino  acids,  soytone,  malt
extract,  NH4Cl,  and  NH4NO3  at  1%  w/w),  metal  salts
(CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, CuSO4, CoSO4, FeSO4, ZnSO4, and
KCl  at  2.5 mM),  surfactant  (Tween  20,  Tween  80,  Triton
X-100  at  0.05%  v/w,  and  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  [SDS]
and  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  [EDTA]  at  0.4 mM).
SSF  process  was  carried  out  at  30oC  for  3  days  with
wheat  bran  containing  33%  initial  moisture,  which  was
inoculated  with  10%  (v/w)  of  a  1-day-old  seeding  cul-
ture. Each experiment was replicated three times.

Results  and  Discussion

Improvement of fungal strain producing cellulase. Cel-
lulase-hyper  producing  Aspergillus  sp.  SU14  was  selected
by  γ-  and  UV-irradiation,  and  NTG  treatment  described
earlier.  The  cellulose  activity  of  the  selected  SU-M15
mutant  was  19.2 U/g,  which  represented  a  2-fold  improved
activity  than  that  of  wild  type  (9.65 U/g)  (Fig.  1).  The
success of the presently-employed mutant selection condi-
tions  has  been  amply  demonstrated.  For  example,  Ther-
momyces lanuginosus treated with three cycles of UV and
NTG  elevated  α-amylase  and  glucosamylase  by  7-fold
and  3-fold,  respectively,  as  compared  to  the  wild  type,  in
one  study  [17].  In  another  study,  F.  oxysporum  succes-
sively  treated  with  UV  and  NTG  displayed  3-fold  ele-
vated cellulose activity than wild type [11].

strates  used  for  the  colonization  of  Aspergillus  sp.  SU-
M15, as indicated by the maximum visible growth and the
highest enzyme yield (Fig. 2A). Therefore, solid wheat bran
was chosen for further experiments.
Initial moisture content in the solid substrate: Cellulase
production depends on the moisture level in the solid sub-
strate.  A  50%  moisture  content  resulted  in  cellulose  pro-
duction  (76.6 U/g)  that  was  much  higher  than  obtained  at
other  moisture  levels  (Fig.  2B).  Moisture  contents  < 40%
or  > 55%  were  not  suitable  for  high  cellulase  production.
In  SSF,  moisture  level  plays  an  important  role  in  biosyn-
thesis  and  secretion  of  many  kinds  of  enzymes,  especially
cellulases.  Very  high  moisture  content  in  solid  medium
results  in  decreased  substrate  porosity  as  well  as  reducing
oxygen penetration among the substrate particles [18], but
excessively  low  moisture  levels  in  solid  medium  leads  to
poor microbial growth, poor development and poor acces-
sibility to nutrients [18].
Incubation  temperature: Temperature  strongly  affects
the  SSF  process,  which  varies  according  to  the  organism
involved.  Even  slight  changes  in  temperature  can  affect
cellulase  production.  Presently,  the  optimal  temperature
for the highest production of cellulase was 35oC, with cel-
lulase  production  decreasing  at  higher  temperatures  (Fig.
2C).
Medium pH: The optimal pH varies with different micro-
organisms  and  enzymes.  Presently,  the  highest  production

cial  in  optimizing  SSF.  Presently,  wheat  ban  resulted  in  a
favorably  high  production  of  cellulase  (19.2 U/g),  while
other solid media such as husk, sawdust did not (Fig. 2A).

of  cellulase  was  observed  at  a  pH  of  3.5  (Fig.  2D).  The
influence  of  pH  on  cellulase  production  highlighted  the
widely-known importance of pH for microbial growth and
metabolic  activities,  and  the  sensitivity  of  the  latter  to  pH
change.
Fermentation  time: The  highest  production  of  enzyme
(28.31 U/g)  was  observed  after  3  days  of  fermentation
(Fig. 3A). 
Aeration  area: The  quantity  of  moistened  wheat  bran
per  flask  volume  of  culture  markedly  affected  the  poros-
ity  and  aeration  of  the  medium.  Production  of  cellulase
was  greatest  (29.6 U/g)  at  a  substrate  mass : flask  volume
ratio  of  3 : 100  (Fig.  3B).  This  ratio  was  used  for  further
experiments.
Age  of  seeding  culture: A  seeding  culture  age  of  2
days  was  suitable  for  inoculation  and  resulted  in  the  high
production  of  cellulase  (30.5 U/g).  Use  of  seeding  cul-
tures  more  than  2-day-old  produced  a  rapid  decrease  of
cellulase production (Fig. 3C).
Inoculum  size: Cellulase  production  increased  together
with  an  increasing  of  initial  inoculum  size  ranging  from
10~50%  (v/w)  of  total  inoculated  solid  medium.  Maxi-
mum  cellulase  production  (32.34 U/g)  was  observed  at  an
inoculum size of 26% (v/w) (Fig. 3D). This inoculum size
was  employed  for  further  experiments.  The  results  high-
lighted the importance of inoculum density in SSF. Higher
inoculum  levels  increased  the  spore  number  per  gram  of

solid substrate, as well as the water content in the medium;
both factors acted to hinder the penetration of oxygen into
the  solid  medium,  inhibiting  fungal  growth  and  cellulase
production.  However,  a  lower  inoculum  size  of  seeding
culture  extended  the  time  required  for  the  fermentation
process to complete a batch culture.

Effect of medium additives on the enzyme production.
Carbon: Glucose,  corn  starch,  sucrose,  maltose  or  rice
starch was supplemented to the basal medium, each at 1%
(v/w).  Each  additive  differentially  affected  cellulase  pro-
duction. Rice starch and corn starch slightly enhanced cel-
lulase  production,  while  the  other  carbon  sources  did  not
enhance cellulase production (Fig. 4A).
Nitrogen: NH4Cl,  urea,  and  malt  extract  significantly
enhanced  the  production  of  cellulase,  while  skim  milk
markedly decreased cellulase production (Fig. 4B).
Surfactants: Surfactants and fatty acids can enhance the
production  of  hydrolytic  enzymes  [19].  Surfactants  are
crucial  in  enhancing  microbial  growth  in  SSF  by  promot-
ing  the  penetration  of  water  into  the  solid  substrate  matrix,
leading  in  an  increase  of  surface  area  [20].  Presently,
amendment  of  wheat  bran  with  any  of  the  tested  surfac-
tants (Tween 20, Tween 80, Triton X100, EDTA and SDS)
enhanced cellulase production. Tween 80 and EDTA were
most  effective,  and  resulted  in  cellulase  production  of
38~40 U/g (Fig. 4C).

Metal  salts: The  influence  of  metal  salts  on  fermenta-
tive  metabolism  is  not  well-documented.  CuSO4  is  an
essential  salt  for  some  organisms  [21].  However,  pres-
ently  all  tested  metal  salts  enhanced  cellulase  production,
except  CuSO4  (Fig.  4D).  Solid  medium  supplemented
with MgCl2 produced the highest yield of cellulase (43 U/
g) (Fig. 4D).

Production  of  cellulase  in  supplemented  medium  at
optimal conditions. Cellulase was produced by Aspegil-
lus  sp.  SU-M15  using  SSF  from  wheat-bran  using  the
aforementioned  optimized  parameters.  Cellulase  produc-
tion  was  82.50 U/g  after  72 hr,  which  was  an  8.5-fold
increase over the wild-type (Fig. 5).

In  conclusion,  a  mutant  fungal  strain  was  created  by
repeated  and  sequential  mutagenesis  with  Co60  γ-rays,  UV
radiation  and  NTG.  From  the  resulting  500  mutants,
Aspergillus  sp.  SU-M15  was  selected.  SU-M15  was  culti-
vated  in  SSF  for  the  production  of  cellulase  using  wheat
bran  as  the  substrate.  Under  the  deduced  optimized
medium  and  SSF  conditions,  the  cellulase  production  of
SU-M15  was  82.5 U/g,  representing  an  8.5-fold  increase
in  cellulase  production  than  that  produced  in  wheat  bran
basal medium by the wild type strain.
