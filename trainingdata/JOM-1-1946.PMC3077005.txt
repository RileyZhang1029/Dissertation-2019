Background: The purpose of this study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in persistent apical lesions on
root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular methods.
Design: Twenty surgically removed apical lesions from therapy-resistant teeth were examined for the presence
of bacterial DNA using PCR targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, followed by cloning and sequencing.
Results: Bacterial DNA was detected in 17 of the 20 samples (85%). A total of 236 clones were analyzed.
Seven different bacterial phyla were represented and a total of 75 different bacterial taxa were identified; 36%
of the species have not yet been cultivated. Commonly detected bacterial species included Fusobacterium spp.,
Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroidetes spp.,
Peptostreptococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp.
Conclusions: A wide range of bacteria was identified in periapical lesions on therapy-resistant teeth. These
bacteria may contribute in the etiology of periapical infection and impede healing of these lesions.

Teeth with apical periodontitis are highly prevalent

amongst adults (1). The majority of apical period-
ontal lesions are located in previously root-filled
teeth (16). The proportion of root-filled teeth with apical
periodontitis was 43% in a study comprising 250 35-year-
old inhabitants in Norway in 2003 (7).

Bacteria play the major role in the etiology of periapical
lesion formation (8, 9), resulting in bone resorption which
is an active process carried out by osteoclasts. Bacteria can
gain access to the dental pulp through the crown or root
surfaces in association with processes such as caries,
periodontal disease, or trauma. A select group of micro-
organisms colonizing the normally sterile root canal space
can cause pulp necrosis and inflammation in the sur-
rounding bone. In well-controlled studies, where the root
canal is properly instrumented and obturated, a success
rate of 8090% has been shown (10, 11). However, if
bacteria are resistant to host defense mechanisms and/or
therapy, they will survive within the root canal system and
periapical tissue. In such cases, healing of the periapical
lesion is compromised.

Culture-independent analysis using the bacterial ribo-
somal RNA (rRNA) genes has provided insights into the
composition of mixed microbial communities in the root

canals (1219). It has been demonstrated that several
uncultivated phylotypes and newly named species are
present in the root canals associated with asymptomatic
primary or persistent endodontic infections (18), and
these can also take part in the root canal flora associated
with symptomatic endodontic infections (15).

While several studies have shown that Propionibacter-
ium and Actinomyces spp. can survive and thrive in
persistent periapical lesions (20, 21), it is controversial
whether or not a consortium of different species can live in
apical lesions. At present there is scarce information about
the role of microorganisms in apical lesions on therapy-
resistant teeth. One recent culture-independent study (22)
identified bacterial DNA,
including unidentified and
uncultured species, in samples from extraradicular infec-
tions. Studies employing molecular
techniques have
shown that the bacterial diversity in most environments
is strongly underestimated in surveys using cultivation-
based techniques (2325), in some cases with less than 1%
of the organisms being cultivable (26). As only 50% of the
oral bacteria have been cultivated, it is likely that at least
some members of the uncultivable flora may contribute
to disease. Molecular assays have shown that 7001,000
species can colonize different oral biofilms, far more than

detected by cultivation (25, 27). The development of 16s
rRNA phylogenetic methodology has widened the scope
of detectable microorganisms to include uncultivable
organisms that may play a significant, as yet undefined
role in the pathogenesis of oral disease (25, 27, 28).

Since tissue invasion is considered a major step in the
the periapical
pathogenesis and complete healing of
lesion is the ultimate goal
in the treatment of apical
periodontitis, the understanding of endodontic disease
requires knowledge on the entire bacterial population.
The aim of the present study was to further investigate
the bacterial diversity in persistent apical
lesions on
root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular
methods.

Methods

Subjects and sample collection
Twenty patients (age 2793, mean age 56) with persistent
apical periodontitis were surgically treated with apicec-
tomies by the same oral surgeon. Each patient was
referred to the oral surgeon for the treatment of one
tooth (Fig. 1). None of the teeth had previously responded
to conventional endodontic therapy. Fistulous tracts or
endo-perio-like lesions related to the teeth to be treated
were not present. No patients had pain at the time of
surgery and none had taken antibiotics the previous two
months before surgery. Radiographically, it was evident
that the patients referred for treatment had root-filled
teeth with periapical radiolucencies of diameters varying

between 4 and 12 mm. Clinical inspection showed that all
teeth had satisfactory coronal restorations.

All patients had an oral rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine
gluconate solution for 30 sec immediately before surgery.
The present investigation used a full-thickness muco-
periosteal flap, reflected without involving the sulcular
area of the periodontium. A submarginal incision was
applied in order to avoid contamination of the periapical
lesion with microorganisms present
in the marginal
area. Care was taken to avoid contamination from saliva.
The whole lesion was enucleated before apicectomy.
Samples were transferred to 200 ml of lysis buffer from
the extraction kit QiaAmp† DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
GmbH, Germany) and subsequently kept at 708C prior
to DNA extraction. The study was approved by the
Norwegian Ethical Board. Informed consent was received
from all patients.

Preparation of DNA and PCR amplification of 16s
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes
DNA was extracted using the QiaAmp† DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tion. PCR amplification of 16s rRNA gene was per-
formed using previously published universal eubacterial
primers (PA and PD) (MWG-Biotech, GmbH, Ebers-
berg, Germany) (29). Amplicons were purified using the
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).

Cloning procedures and 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
sequencing
The amplicons were ligated into the plasmid vector
pCR4-TOPO and transformed into Eschericia coli one
Shot Top10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen, Oslo,
Norway). The transformed cells were plated onto Luria
Bertoni agar plates, supplemented with kanamycin and
incubated overnight at 378C. From each sample, 1236
clones were randomly selected to investigate bacterial
species. A total of 236 clones were investigated. Correct
sizes of the inserts were determined by PCR with M13
forward (20) and M13 reverse primer (Invitrogen)
followed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. DNA
amplicons (7 ml) were purified in a mixture containing 1
ml exonuclease and 1 ml shrimp alkaline phosphatase,
and incubated for 15 min at 378C and 15 min at 808C,
as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Bios-
ciences, Cleveland, OH). The purified product was
sequenced on both strands using the primers PB and
PC (MWG-Biotech, GmbH)
(29) and the Big-Dye
Terminator mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA),
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The sequen-
cing reactions were run on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems).

The partial 16s rDNA sequences of approximately 500
bp were used to determine bacterial identity. For identi-
fication of closest relatives, the consensus sequences were

compared with 16s rDNA sequences in GenBank data-
bases using the Blast 2.1 program from the GenBank
Online Service. Clone sequences with 98100% identity
were considered to be of the same bacterial species. The
sequences were aligned with the CLUSTAL W program.
A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed
using the package MEGA, version 4.1 (30). Two hundred
bootstrap trees were generated, and bootstrap confidence
levels were determined with the MEGA program.

Results
In the present study, no PCR product was obtained from
three samples (nos. 5, 11, and 20) using the primers PA
and PD while 17 of 20 (85%) lesions were positive for
bacterial DNA. Bacterial species from seven different
phyla were represented (Table 1). Bacteroidetes, Fusobac-
teria, and Firmicutes dominated,
followed by Spiro-
chaetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Synergistes.
All specimens harbored 111 different bacterial species
with a mean of seven species per lesion. The bacterial
profiles of patients differed in diversity and bacterial
dominance (Table 2). One patient (no. 15) presented with
monoculture (Fusobacterium spp.), two patients had three
species (no. 3: Fusobacterium spp., Selenomonas-like spp.,
uncultured bacterial species; no. 4: Fusobacterium spp.,
Treponema spp., Propionibacterium spp.), otherwise 411
different species were found within the patient samples.
Fusobacterium spp. were the most prevalent (38% of taxa),
detected in all but two lesions (88%). Fusobacterium
nucleatum was the only bacterium that could be identified
to species level within this genus. Several other strains of
Fusobacterium were also found, including yet uncultivable
strains. Bacteroidetes was the second most prevalent
phylum with Prevotella as the most commonly detected
genus (present in 35% of the lesions). Other well-known
endodontic bacterial species such as Porphyromonas
endodontalis, Bacteroidetes spp., and Tannerella forsythia

of bacterial phyla or taxa could be observed using the chi-
square test (Fisher’s exact test, data not shown).

A high bacterial diversity, with 75 different bacterial
taxa, were identified amongst the 236 clones investigated
(Fig. 2). All 16s rDNA sequences, except for three,
showed 98100% similarity to sequences deposited to
GenBank. Three isolates (uncultured bacterium clone 2:3
[FJ472593], uncultured bacterium clone 7:8 [FJ472594],
and uncultured bacterium clone 14:12 [FJ472595]) were
not closely related to any sequence previously in the
GenBank database and,
thus, might represent new
phylotypes. Notably, 36% of the taxa represented yet
uncultivable/unidentified species and these were present
in 88% of the lesions comprising 23% of the total clones
investigated.

Discussion
The present study assessed the occurrence of cultivable
and also uncultivated phylotypes in persistent apical
lesions on root-filled teeth using culture-independent
molecular methods. Most studies of the bacterial etiology
of periapical lesions have used either culture-based or
targeted DNA approaches (3133), and it is therefore
likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. Sampling of
microorganisms in the periapical area during surgery is
difficult because the samples are easily contaminated with
microorganisms from the marginal area and the indigen-
ous oral microbiota unless care is taken to avoid such
contamination (3133). During surgery, a submarginal
incision was performed in order to avoid contamination
in the surgical field. It was, therefore, assumed that the
bacterial species recovered in this study were present
in the refractory lesions before surgery. Microbiologi-
cal profiling has previously indicated that following a
marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket
reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacter-
emia or direct translocation (32).

In the present study, three periapical samples were
negative for bacterial DNA, thus suggesting that in few
cases the bacteria causing the lesions may be present
exclusively in the root canal system. Alternatively, some-
times DNA extractions and subsequent PCR simply do
not work. Eighty-eight percent of the lesions harbored
uncultivable/unidentified bacterial species, constituting
34% of the taxa identified. These findings clearly indicate
that previously unrecognized bacterial species are present
in the apical lesions and may participate in persistent
apical periodontitis. This is in concordance with the
findings of Noguchi et al. (22) who detected unidentified
and uncultivable bacterial species in 11 of 14 samples
from extraradicular biofilm. The pathogenicity of the
uncultivable microbiota in endodontics is not known.
However, it is reasonable that at least some members of
this part of the microbiota are pathogenic and may
contribute in the disease process.

Many of the species identified in the present study were
the same that have been reported in extraradicular disease
based on cultivation and DNADNA hybridization
techniques. Fusobacterium is commonly isolated from
root canal infections, and in the present study all except
one lesion where bacterial DNA was detected harbored
this organism. F. nucleatum was recently found in high
proportions
canals
with multiple displacement amplification, checkerboard
DNADNA hybridization, and reverse-capture checker-
board hybridization (17, 34, 35). Fusobacterium species
are known to co-aggregate with many species of oral
bacteria and they are common participants in oral disease
(36). To our knowledge, the study by Noguchi et al. (22)
is the only published of extraradicular infection using
PCR-based 16s rRNA gene assay. They identified bacter-
ial DNA in 14 of 20 lesions and 113 bacterial species
were isolated. F. nucleatum (14 of 14) and Porphyromonas
gingivalis (12 of 14) were frequently detected. However,
some teeth were extracted before examination which can
give false positive results from the periodontal or
indigenous oral microbiota. This might explain the high
levels of the periodontopathogen, P. gingivalis, as op-
posed to our study where it was absent. However, P.
gingivalis has been detected in small areas of periapical
lesions by fluorescence in situ hybridization and DNA
DNA hybridization (31, 37).

Organisms belonging to Porphyromonas spp., Trepo-
nema spp., and T. forsythia are well-known pathogens
in periodontal diseases. In the recent years, these species
have also been detected in periapical tissue by DNA
DNA and in situ hybridization techniques (31, 33, 37).
T. forsythia is difficult to culture and has not yet been
recovered from root canals or periapical tissue with
cultivation techniques. This organism is, however, fre-
quently detected in necrotic canals with molecular
methods (34, 38, 39). Although some authors have
indicated that treponemes are important pathogens in
endodontic disease (4043), their fastidious growth has
led these organisms to be underestimated in endodontic
disease. It is only recently that molecular genetic analyses
confirm their presence in infected root canals (14, 34, 44,
45) and periapical tissue (22, 31, 33, 37). Based on their
frequent detection by molecular techniques, they might
be potential endodontic pathogens. Prevotella spp. have
frequently been found in different types of endodontic
infections (46, 47), but have only been detected in the
apical tissue with DNADNA hybridization and in situ
hybridization (31, 37). A Synergistes phylotype was
detected in one lesion in the present study. This phylotype
has recently been shown to be a frequent member of the
endodontic microbiota (18). Most isolates of Solobacter-
ium are found in the oral cavity, particularly in period-
ontitis (16, 48, 49) and in patients with halitosis (50).

A remarkably high diversity of species was identified
in the periapical
lesions. Although traditional views
suggest that organisms surviving root canal treatment
comprise a select group of the most robust organisms,
the application of ecological parameters indicates that
bacterial survival after root canal treatment will depend
not only on the robustness of the organisms, but on how
good an adaptor the organism is to the new limiting
factors in their corresponding niches. Surface adherence
by bacteria to form biofilms is an example of bacterial
adaptation. Increasing amount of information is now
available on the existence of polymicrobial biofilm
communities on root tips (51) and also in the apical
tissue (37). The foundation for this ecological approach
to endodontic infections suggests disease is caused by a
polymicrobial microbiota that undergoes physiological
and genetic changes triggered by changes in the root
canal environment. The frequent recovery of Enterococ-
cus faecalis in root canals, associated with persistent
infections, brought an intense research interest in this
bacterium. Actually, E. faecalis is seldom identified in
persistent apical lesions (22), and was not recovered in
any lesion in the present study,
indicating that this
organism may not be as important when it comes to
invading the apical area.

Molecular methods have expanded the list of endo-
dontic pathogens by inclusion of some fastidious bacter-
ial species and even uncultivated bacterial species that
have never previously been found in endodontic infec-
tions by cultivation procedures. It has been shown that
bacteria form biofilms in the root canal and extraradi-
cular area, both on root tips, extruded gutta percha
points, and directly in the periapical tissue (37, 51, 52). It
is reasonable that extraradicular infections are caused
during the acute phase of apical periodontitis or because
of overinstrumentation by the dentist during root canal
therapy. However, from a biofilm infectious viewpoint, it
is possible that extraradicular sites are infected both
during the acute or chronic phase of apical periodontitis.
Bacterial species in the infected root canals may invade
extraradicular sites and form biofilm which in turn can
function as a focus of acute infections.

In conclusion, a wide variety of bacterial species,
including a high percentage of uncultured/unidentified
bacteria were found to colonize periapical lesions. Since
endodontic infections develop in a previously sterile
place which does not contain a normal microbiota, every
bacterial species present in the mixed consortium has the
potential to play a role in the infectious disease process.
The present study has expanded the list of bacterial
species present in the extraradicular area suggesting that
the microbial etiology of periradicular disease is far more
complex than previously anticipated.
