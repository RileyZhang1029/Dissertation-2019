A commentary on

Acetogenesis  in  the  energy-starved  deep 
biosphere – a paradox?
by  Mark  Alexander  Lever  (2012).  Front. 
Microbiol. 2:284. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2011.00284

In  the  beginning  of  1983,  when  I  was  a 
post-doctoral student at the University of 
Illinois, Ralph Wolfe handed me an offprint 
of a long article and said: “Read this!” That 
paper was the review by Thauer et al. (1977) 
on “Energy conservation in chemotrophic 
anaerobic  bacteria.”  I  have  read  it  many 
times. I remember that the first and second 
time  I  understood  very  little.  During  the 
third and fourth reading I started to grasp 
the ideas expressed and to appreciate them. 
And after having read the paper for the fifth 
and sixth time I had become convinced that 
microbial metabolism and metabolic diver-
sity can only be properly understood using 
the  kind  of  thermodynamic  analyses  on 
which Thauer and his colleagues based their 
review. Until this day I use this thermody-
namic approach to explain the functioning 
of the microbial world in the basic and more 
advanced microbiology courses I teach.

At the same time Ralph Wolfe also intro-
duced me to the world of the acetogens. I still 
remember how excited he was that the culture 
of Clostridium aceticum, isolated in the 1930s 
(Wieringa, 1936) but subsequently consid-
ered as lost, had been revived from a prepara-
tion of endospores of the original strain and 
thus became again available for study (Braun 
et  al.,  1981).  The  place  of  the  acetogens  in 
nature, and especially those species that live 
as  autotrophs  on  hydrogen  as  their  energy 
source, has always been enigmatic. The reason 
becomes immediately obvious when calculat-
ing the thermodynamics of the process, com-
paring the Gibbs free energy change under 
standard  conditions  of  three  competing 
processes: sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, 
and homoacetogenic metabolism:

As  long  as  sulfate  is  available,  sul-
fate  reducers  will  consume  most  of  the 
hydrogen. They obtain more energy from 
hydrogen oxidation, and their affinity for 
hydrogen is much higher than that of the 
methanogenic  Archaea,  explaining  why 
the methanogens are out-competed when 
the energy source is limiting (Kristjansson 
et  al.,  1982).  When  sulfate  is  limiting, 
methanogens  will  take  over.  No  similar 
competition  studies  between  methano-
gens  and  acetogens  were  ever  reported, 
but based on the lower energy yield of the 
acetogenic  reaction  it  is  highly  probably 
that the acetogens will lose the competi-
tion.  Recent  calculations  confirm  this: 
assuming  a “biological  energy  quantum” 
(the  minimum  amount  of  free  energy 
change  of  a  reaction  that  can  drive  the 
formation  of  ATP)  of  −10  kJ,  the  ther-
modynamic  threshold  concentrations  of 
H2  calculated  for  chemolithoautotrophic 
sulfate reducers, methanogens, and aceto-
gens are ∼0.6, 11, and 410 nM, respectively 
(Lever, 2011). These numbers clearly show 
that the “homoacetogenic” reaction from 
H2–CO2 is thermodynamically unfavora-
ble.  The  advantage  of  the  methanogens 
over  the  acetogens  is  also  demonstrated 
in  the  following  calculation:  at  partial 
pressures  for  hydrogen  and  for  methane 
of 10−4 and 0.5 atm, respectively, and bicar-
bonate, and acetate concentrations of 100 
and 10 mM, the Gibbs free energy is −40 kJ 
per reaction for the formation of methane 
from bicarbonate and hydrogen, but only 
−13 kJ for the formation of acetate. Dolfing 
(1988) wrote: “A meaningful evaluation of 
the energy conservation and the selection 
mechanism  that  govern  the  outcome  of 
competition  between  methanogens  and 
acetogens has to wait until more data are 

available  on  (growth  parameters)  μ,  Ks, 
Km,  Y,  and  q  of  these  organisms,  prefer-
ably obtained in chemostat experiments.” 
To  my  knowledge  no  such  experiments 
have yet been performed.

The  question  therefore  remains  where 
in  nature  the  acetogens  can  out-compete 
the methanogens. In recent years evidence 
is accumulating that, unexpectedly, aceto-
gens may represent a quantitatively impor-
tant component of the microbial ecosystem 
in the oligotrophic marine and terrestrial 
deep  biosphere.  The  paper  by  Lever  pro-
vides an in-depth analysis of the possible 
factors that give the acetogens advantages 
in this vast, but largely unexplored niche. 
Lever argues that under conditions encoun-
tered in the subseafloor, the energy yields 
of most acetogenesis reactions are sufficient 
to  support  growth.  Furthermore,  aceto-
gens have a remarkable metabolic flexibil-
ity compared to methanogens and sulfate 
reducers,  and  can  use  more  substrates  or 
substrate  combinations  as  energy  source. 
Moreover, the fact that they use the energy-
efficient reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (also 
known  as  the  Wood–Ljungdahl  pathway) 
both  for  autotrophic  carbon  fixation  and 
for energy production makes their metabo-
lism highly efficient, enabling them to save 
precious energy for survival when stressed 
(Lever, 2011).

The title of this commentary – “There 
must  be  an  acetogen  somewhere”  para-
phrases Woese’s  (1994) “There  must  be  a 
prokaryote somewhere.” Nobody can have 
any doubt that prokaryotes play a central 
function in nature, but the role of the aceto-
gens was never really clear. Therefore Lever’s 
paper  contributes  much  toward  a  proper 
assessment of the  place of this intriguing 
group of prokaryotes in anaerobic ecosys-
tems worldwide.
