Kluyveromyces  fragilis  KCTC  7260  and  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904,  which  both  grew  well  in  pear  marc  extract,
were  selected  and  their  growth  profiles  and  physiological  functionalities  were  determined.  Both  of  the  selected  yeasts
established  maximal  growth  by  20 hr  of  cultivation  at  30oC  in  pear  marc  extract.  The  cell-free  extracts  showed  high
antihypertensive  angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  inhibitory  activity  of  68.9%  and  52.1%,  respectively.  The  extracts  also
displayed  9.2 U/mL  and  12.0 U/mL  of  protease  activity,  respectively.

KEYWORDS : Kluyveromyces  fragilis,  Pear  marc  extract,  Physiological  functionality,  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae

Pear  contains  10~13%  sugar,  various  organic  acids  and
vitamin C [1]. Especially, pear contains flavonoid compounds
such as quercetin and leuteolin, and polyphenol compounds
including  chlorogenic  acid,  catechin  and  arbutin.  These
constituents  bestow  various  physiological  functionalites
such  as  antioxidant  activity,  immunostimulating  activity,
cholesterol-lowering  activity,  antihypertension  activity  and
anti-inflammatory activity [1, 2].

A  large  amount  of  pear  marc  is  produced  during  the
preparation  of  pear  juice,  pear  paste  and  pear  makgeolli.
Pear  marc  contains  useful  substances,  such  as  phenolic
compounds,  organic  acid  and  edible  fiber.  However,  only
a  small  amount  of  pear  marc  is  used  as  animal  feed.  The
bulk  of  pear  marc  is  discharged  in  the  field,  causing
environmental  pollution.  It  is  imperative,  therefore,  to
improve  the  efficiency  of  pear  marc  utilization  and  to
develop high value bioactive agents from pear marc.

Yeast  has  some  industrial  advantages,  including  rapid
growth, ease of cultivation and the capacity to be grown in
a  cheap  medium  containing  agricultural  by-products  [3].
Recently,  bioactive compounds such as an antihypertensive
angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitor  [3],
ribonucleotides  [4, 5]  chitosan  [6],  an  anti-angiogenic
compound  [7]  and  an  antidementia  β-secretase  inhibitor
[8]  have  been  produced  and  characterized  from  yeasts
including Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  growth  characteristics,

physiological  functionality  and  enzyme  activity  of  yeasts
grown  on  pear  marc  extracts  for  the  efficient  utilization
and prevention of environmental pollution of pear marc.

Materials  and  Methods

Strains,  pear  marc  and  chemicals. Eighty  six  strains
of  yeast  including  S.  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904,  Candida
krusei  KCTC  7213,  Torulopsis  sphaerica  KCTC  7138,
Kluyveromyces fragilis KCTC 7260 and Zygosaccharomyces
rouxii  KCCM  12066  were  used  in  this  study.  Pear  marc
containing  80%  moisture  was  obtained  from  the  Wooil
pear  processing  plant,  Gwangju,  Chonnam  Province,
South  Korea.  Two  liter  of  distilled  water  were  added  to
100 g  of  pear  marc  and  shaken  for  24 hr  at  30oC.  After
centrifugation  at  10,000 ×g  for  15 min,  the  extracts  were
harvested.  ACE  was  extracted  from  rabbit  lung  acetone
powder  (Sigma-Aldrich,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  Hippuric
acid-histidine-leucine, fibrin, pyrogallol, and 2,2-diphenyl-
1-picrylhydrazy  (DPPH)  were  also  purchased  from  Sigma-
Aldrich. Unless otherwise specified, all the chemicals were
of analytical grade.

Assay  of  growth  and  physiological  functionality. The
selected  yeasts  were  cultured  in  the  pear  marc  extract  at
30oC for 20 hr and growth was determined by absorbance
at  660 nm.  After  centrifugation  at  10,000 ×g  for  15 min,

the  cells  were  harvested  and  disrupted  by  vortexing  with
glass  beads.  After  centrifugation  at  12,000 ×g  for  20 min,
the  cell-free  extract  was  obtained  and  physiological
functionalities were determined as follows.

ACE  inhibitory  activity  was  assayed  by  the  method  of
Cushman  and  Cheung [9]. A mixture containing 100 mM
sodium  borate  buffer  (pH  8.3),  300 mM  NaCl,  3 units  of
ACE  and  an  appropriate  amount  of  the  cell-free  extract
was  preincubated  for  10 min  at  37oC.  The  reaction  was
initiated  by  adding  50 µL  of  Hip-His-Leu  at  a  final
concentration  of  5 mM  and  was  terminated  after  30 min
of  incubation  by  the  addition  of  250 µL  of  1.0 N  HCl.
The  liberated  hippuric  acid  was  extracted  with  1 mL  of
ethyl  acetate  and  0.8 mL  of  the  extract  was  dried  with  a
Speed  Vac  Concentrator  (EYELA,  Tokyo,  Japan).  The
residue  was  dissolved  in  1 mL  of  sodium  borate  buffer.
The absorbance at 228 nm was measured.

Fibrinolytic  activity  was  assayed  by  the  method  of
Fayek  and  El-Sayed  [10].  Each  sample  of  0.5 mL  was
added  to  3 mL  of  a  substrate  solution  (0.6%  fibrin  in
0.1 M Mcllvaine buffer, pH 7.0) and incubated at 40oC for
10 min.  The  reaction  was  stopped  by  adding  3 mL  of
0.4 M  trichloroacetic  acid  for  30 min.  The  mixture  was
then filtered through Whatman No. 2 filter paper (Whatman,
Newton,  MA,  USA).  A  reaction  mixture  of  1 mL  of  the
filtrate,  5 mL  of  0.4 M  Na2CO3  and  1 mL  of  1 N  Folin
reagent  was  placed  at  room  temperature  for  30 min.  The
amount  of  tyrosin  released  from  the  fibrin  as  a  substrate
was  determined  from  the  tyrosine  standard  curve  by
measuring the absorbance at 660 nm.

Antioxidant activity was also assayed by the method of
Lee  et  al.  [11, 12]  using  DPPH  as  substrate.  A  0.8 mL
volume  of  DPPH  solution  (12.5 mg  DPPH  dissolved  in
100 mL  ethanol)  was  added  to  0.2 mL  of  the  sample,
shaken  for  10 sec,  and  left  for  10 min.  The  absorbance  at
525 nm was then determined  and  antioxidant  activity  was
calculated  as  [(A525  of  reaction  mixture − A525  of  sample
alone)/A525 of blank ] × 100.

Superoxide  dismutase  (SOD)-like  activity  was  assayed
as described  previously [11]. A 20 mL sample was added
to  20 mL  of  55 mM  tris-cacodylic  acid  buffer  (TCB,  pH
8.2),  after  which  the  mixture  was  homogenized  for  2 min
and  centrifuged  at  4oC  for  30 min  at  12,000 rpm.  The
supernatant  was  adjusted  to  pH  8.2  and  then  increased  in
volume up to 50 mL (sample extracts). Five µL of 24 mM
pyrogallol  containing  10 mM  HCl  (substrate)  was  added
to 0.95 mL of the sample extracts, after which absorbance
at  420 nm  was  measured  for  the  first  2 min.  SOD-like
activity (%) was calculated as [(A − B)/A] × 100, where A
is  the  increase  in  absorbance  of  TCB  (blank)  and  B  the
increase in absorbance of the sample.

Tyrosinase inhibitory activity was assayed by the method
of  Kim  et  al.  [13].  The  conversion  of  L-DOPA  to  a  red-
colored  oxidation  product,  dopachrome,  was  measured

spectrophotometrically. A 0.1 mL sample was incubated for
5 min  at  30oC.  At  time  zero,  1 mL  of  L-DOPA  solution
(4 mg/mL)  was  rapidly  added  while  stirring,  and  the
absorbance was measured at 475 nm. After incubation for
an  additional  5 min,  the  mixture  was  shaken  again,  and  a
second reading was determined. Tyrosinase inhibitory activity
(%)  was  determined  as  [1 − (A475  of  sample  reaction
mixture)/A475 blank] × 100.

Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity was determined by
a  modification  of  a  previously-described  method  [14].
Xanthine  oxidase  (0.2 U/mL)  100 µL  was  added  to  a
mixture  containing  0.6 mL  of  0.1 M  potassium  phosphate
buffer  (pH  7.5)  and  100 µL  of  sample  (1 mg/mL)  and
200 µL  of  1 mM  xanthine.  After  reacting  the  mixture  at
37oC for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of
200 µL of 1 N HCl. Protein was removed by centrifugation
at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and then amount of the released
uric acid was determined by absorbance at 292 nm.

α-Glucosidase inhibitory activity was assayed as follows.
α-Glucosidase  and  p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucophylanoside
(PNPG)  were  dissolved  in  0.1 M  potassium  phosphate
buffer (pH 6.8). An enzymatic reaction mixture composed
of  100 µL  α-glucosidase  (0.2 U/mL),  100 µL  of  1.5 mM
PNPG and sample was incubated at 37oC for 25 min. The
reaction  was  terminated  by  adding  100 µL  of  sodium
carbonate solution (0.1 M, pH 9.8). The inhibitory activity
of  sample  was  determined  by  measuring  the  remaining
activity  of  α-glucosidase  at  a  concentration  of  50 µM.
Enzymatic  activity  was  measured  by  the  amount  of  the
released p-nitrophenol detected by absorbance at 405 nm.

Results  and  Discussion

Growth  characteristics  of  yeasts. Eighty  six  strains  of
yeast  were  cultivated  in  pear  marc  extract  at  30oC  for
48 hr and five strains grew in the pear marc extract (Table
1). Among these, K. flagilis KCTC 7260 and S. cerevisiae
KCTC 7904 grew especially well in the pear marc extract.
Their  growth  was  better  than  those  of  C.  krusei  KCTC
7213 (A660;  0.14),  K.  fragilis  KCTC  7260  (A660; 0.13)  and
S. cerevisiae T-71 (A660; 0.32) grown on ginseng-steaming
effluent [5].

Physiological 
physiological  functionalities  of  cell-free  extract  from  the
selected  yeasts  were 
(Table  2).  The
antihypertensive  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  K.  flagilis
KCTC  7260  grown  on  pear  marc  extract  was  68.9%,
which  was  about  16%  higher  than  that  of  the  cell-free
extract from S. cerevisiae KCTC 7904. These results were
higher  than  those  of  the  biomass  from  Pichia  anomala
(31.0%)  [5]  and  its  mutant  HA-2  (16.0%)  [4]  grown  on
ginseng-steaming effluent and the biomass from S. cerevisiae
(42.1%)  grown  on  YEPD  medium  [3].  However,  it  was
lower  than  that  of  P.  anomala  KCCM  11473  (72.0%)
grown on ginseng-steaming effluent [15]. Recently, various
ACE  inhibitors  with  antihypertensive  effects  have  been
isolated from various protein hydrolysates, sake and its by-
products,  Korean  traditional  rice  wines,  cereals  and
legumes,  and  microbes  such  as  yeast  and  mushrooms
including Pleurotus cornucopiae [3, 16]. From our reports
on ACE inhibitory activity of pear yakju (57.2%) [1], pear
wine  (32.2%)  and  pear-strawberry  wine  (70.8%)  [2],  and
from pear marc extract itself (49.5%), we surmise that the
high  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  the  cell-free  extract  from
the  selected  yeasts  grown  on  pear  marc  extract  is  caused
by  transfer  of  ACE  inhibitor  from  pear  marc  extract  or
production  of  ACE  inhibitor  during  cultivation  of  yeasts.
Several  ACE  inhibitors  are  peptides  [3].  Therefore,  cell-
free  extract  of  K.  fragilis  KCTC  7260  was  treated  by
pepsin  under  optimal  reaction  conditions  and  the  ACE
inhibitory  activity  was  determined.  The  ACE  inhibitory
activity  of  K.  fragilis  KCTC  7260  increased  about  9%
after  treatment  of  cell-free  extract  with  pepsin  (77.5%)
(data  not  shown),  indicating  the  peptide  nature  of  the
ACE  inhibitor  of  cell-free  extract  from  K.  fragilis  KCTC
7260. This result was similar to that of alcohol fermentative
S.  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904  [3].  Further  purification  and
characterization  of  the  ACE  inhibitor  from  K.  fragilis
KCTC 7260 is reguired.

Almost  30%  of  antigout  xanthine  oxidase  inhibitory
activity  was  detected  only  in  K.  fragilis  KCTC  7260,
whereas  39.0%  of  SOD-like  activity  was  showed  in  S.
cerevisiae  KCTC  7904.  However,  the  other  functionalities

KCTC  7260  and  S.  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904  in  pear  marc
extract  was  investigated.  Maximum  growth  of  K.  flagilis
KCTC  7260  was  attained  at  20 hr  of  cultivation,  very
similar  to  growth  in  yeast  extract,  peptone,  dextrose
(YEPD)  medium  (Fig.  1).  S.  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904  also
displayed  maximal  growth  after  20 hr  of  cultivation  in
pear marc extract (Fig. 2). However, its growth was lower
than  attained  in  YEPD  medium  and  compared  to  K.
flagilis  KCTC 7260. In another study, Hansenula anomala
KCCM  11473  displayed  maximal  growth  after  6 hr  at

of control).

The activities of α-amylase, lipase and neutral protease
were  spectrophotometrically  determined  by  using  1%
soluble  starch,  triolein  and  0.6%  skim  milk,  respectively
[11,  17].  Neutral  protease  activity  of  the  cell-free  extract
from  K.  fragilis  KCTC  7260  and  S.  cerevisiae  KCTC
7904 were 9.2 U/mL and 12.0 U/mL, respectively. However,
α-amylase  activity  and  lipase  activity  were  very  low  or
not detected (Table 3).

We  have  previously  reported  on  the  production  of
bioactive  ribonucleotide  [5]  and  chitosan  [6]  from  yeasts
grown  on  ginseng-steaming  effluent.  Presently,  K.  fragilis
KCTC 7260 and S. cerevisiae KCTC 7904 grew exuberantly
when  supplied  with  pear  marc  extract.  The  present
findings may be beneficial in the production of high value
antihypertensive  agents  and  prevention  of  environmental
pollution  arising  from  pear  marc  disposal.  Further  studies
are  necessary  on  the  application  the  yeasts  biomass  and
some bioactive compounds from this study into functional
foods or medicinal compounds.
