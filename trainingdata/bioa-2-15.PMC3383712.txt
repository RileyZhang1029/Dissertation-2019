kines, serves as the signals, and a family

is how a
chemotaxis of
GPCR transduces signals to control the
assembly of
the actin network that
generates directional force for cell migra-
tion. Over the past decade, a variety of
signaling components have been impli-
cated to transduce the GPCR signaling
to the actin cytoskeleton. Studies in a
lower eukaryotic organism, Dictyostelium
discoideum, have allowed us to discover
evolutionary
components
involved in the GPCR-controlled actin
network during chemotaxis. However,
complete pathways
linking GPCR to
the actin network are still far from clear.
Here we first summarize the previous
studies on these components, and then
update with our finding showing a new
pathway, consisting of a GPCR, Gβc,
Elmo/Dock, Rac and Arp2/3 and actin.
We suggest that this pathway serves as
a direct linkage between the GPCR/G-
protein,
sensing
machinery, and the actin cytoskeleton,
the machinery of cell movement during
chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells.

cal roles in diverse physiological processes,

such as the recruitment of leukocytes to

and metastasis of
behavior is achieved by integrating chemo-
attractant signals from receptors, such as
chemokine receptors, a family of GPCR
which sense gradients of chemokines, and
regulating cell movement accordingly. The
chemotactic response in eukaryotes such
as Dictyostelium discoideum, immune cells
and cancer cells is accomplished by signal
transduction between two machineries—
the GPCR/G-protein sensing machinery
and
cytoskeleton moving
machinery. In response to a chemokine,
GPCRs

G-proteins consisting of Ga and Gβc
subunits, which in turn regulates

in chemotaxis.2,3 Currently,

cells are still unknown. Fortunately, the
molecular mechanisms that control
the
fundamental aspects of chemotaxis appear
to be evolutionarily conserved, and studies
in the lower eukaryotic model system,
D. discoideum, have allowed us to uncover
molecular components. Over the years,
many of
the
signaling network have been elucidated,
and basic questions have been addressed
in the studies of chemotaxis using the
model system D. discoideum.4 Here, we
will mainly focus on the major signaling
components and pathways that connect
GPCR/G-protein,
chemoattractant
sensing machinery to the actin cytoskele-
ton, the machinery of cell movement in
D. discoideum. Because this
is a mini

Signaling Components Involved
in Chemotaxis in D. discoideum

cAMP,

Many of the core components of chemo-
taxis signaling have been elucidated. In
D. discoideum, binding of
a
chemoattractant, to the receptor, cAR1,
induces the dissociation of heterotrimeric
G-proteins into Ga and Gβc subunits.5
Free Gβc activates
the small Ras-like
G-proteins,
leading to the activation of
phosphoinsositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and
the generation of phosphatidylinositol-
(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phos-
phatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).
Once generated, PIP3 prompts the mem-
brane translocation of proteins containing
pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, such
as
the cytosolic regulator of adenylyl
cyclase (CRAC) and protein kinase B
(PKB), which play roles in the regulation
of actin polymerization during chemo-
taxis.6,7 Phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN), a well-known tumor suppressor,
acts as an opposite regulator by converting
PIP3 to PIP2. When PTEN is missing,
cells
lose the regulation of PIP3 pro-
duction and localization, and as a con-
sequence, cells are defective in chemotaxis
by generating multiple protrusions
in
random directions due to the misregula-
tion of the actin cytoskeleton.8,9 It has
been therefore well established that PIP3
is essential
it was
faced with a challenge from the later
studies by Hoeller and Kay. They found
that D. discoideum cells lacking all five
PI3K isoforms and PTEN are still able
to migrate directionally suggesting that
there must be parallel pathways
that
transduce signals from GPCR/G-protein
to the actin network.10
additional

that
overlap with the PIP3 pathway have been
revealed recently. For instance, Chen et al.
reported that a patatin-like phospholipase
A2 (PLA2) functions in parallel to PI3K
signaling to mediate chemotaxis.11 By
using a genetic screen in the D. discoideum
cells
the
authors identify the genes whose disrup-
tion causes more serious chemotaxis. They

taxis, but cells under typical 5 h starvation
do not. By using genetic screening, they
identified a
cyclase
(sGC)
that can compensate for PI3Ks
and PLA2 in later development. Interest-
ingly sGC has two functions: as a protein
that interacts with the actin filaments at
the front, while as an enzyme which
produces cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP) to induce myosin filaments at
the back of cells.12

Recent findings about TORC2 (target
of rapamycin complex 2) provide more
insights
into elucidating the signaling
mechanisms in chemotaxis. TORC2 was
first reported to regulate polarized actin
assembly in S. cerevisiae.13 Lee et al. then
identified a TORC2 that plays a role in
integrating cell movement during chemo-
taxis and signal relay in Dictyostelium.14
Additionally, Kamimura and colleagues
found that PKB and PKBR1, which is
tethered to the plasma membrane via
N-terminal myristoylation, can be phos-
phorylated at
their hydrophobic motifs
mediated by TORC215 and at their activa-
tion loops mediated by phosphoinositide-
dependent kinase.16 Besides, Cai et al.

there are still
Despite much progress,
significant gaps in our understanding of
the signaling pathways controlling chemo-
taxis. On one hand, as summarized above,
the cAR1/GaGβc machinery regulates
four
signaling enzymes, PI3K, PLA2,
sGC and TORC2, all of which are
involved in chemotaxis, but it remains
unclear how these proteins associate with
upstream G protein subunits; on the other
hand, although these enzymes are impli-
cated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton
to drive cell migration, it is still not well
understood by what mechanisms they link
to downstream components to control the
actin network.

Recently, we discovered a novel signal-
ing pathway that directly links GPCR
signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during
eukaryotic chemotaxis. We demonstrated
that a Gβc effector, ElmoE, transduces
GPCR signaling to the actin network
in D. discoideum.20

DOCK-ELMO complexes receive signals
from GPCRs to activate Rac leading to

and other receptors link to and activate
DOCK-ELMO has not been determined
so far. We demonstrated that GPCRs
regulates ELMO function through form-
ing a complex containing Gβc and an
Elmo protein. In addition, we discovered
that ElmoE associates with Dock-like
proteins, small GTPase RacB, and actin
nucleation Arp2/3 complex as well. We
also found that activation of cAR1 pro-

Do these pathways contribute equally to
