The interferon-inducible host restriction factor bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-
2/tetherin) blocks the release of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses. In turn, these viruses
have evolved speciﬁc antagonists to counteract this host antiviral molecule, such as the HIV-
1 proteinVpu. BST-2 is a type II transmembrane protein with an unusual topology consisting
of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) followed by a single transmembrane (TM) domain, a
coiled-coil extracellular (EC) domain, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor at the
C terminus. We and others showed that BST-2 restricts enveloped virus release by bridg-
ing the host and virion membranes with its two opposing membrane anchors and that
deletion of either one completely abrogates antiviral activity. The EC domain also shows
conserved structural properties that are required for antiviral function. It contains several
destabilizing amino acids that confer the molecule with conformational ﬂexibility to sus-
tain the protein’s function as a virion tether, and three conserved cysteine residues that
mediate homodimerization of BST-2, as well as acting as a molecular ruler that separates
the membrane anchors. Conversely, the efﬁcient release of virions is promoted by the
HIV-1 Vpu protein and other viral antagonists. Our group and others provided evidence
from mutational analyses indicating that Vpu antagonism of BST-2-mediated viral restric-
tion requires a highly speciﬁc interaction of their mutual TM domains. This interpretation
is further supported and expanded by the ﬁndings of the latest structural modeling stud-
ies showing that critical amino acids in a conserved helical face of these TM domains are
required for Vpu–BST-2 interaction and antagonism. In this review, we summarize the cur-
rent advances in our understanding of the structural basis for BST-2 antiviral function as
well as BST-2-speciﬁc viral antagonism.

INTRODUCTION
As a result of exposure to viral pathogens over millions of years,
humans and other mammals evolved intrinsic immunity pro-
teins that provide resistance to infection by directly interfering
with different stages of the viral life cycle. These so-called host
restriction factors are normally induced by interferon-α (IFN-α)
during induction of the innate immune response by viral infec-
tion. A case in point is HIV-1, an extensively studied pathogen
for which four major restriction factors have been identiﬁed: the
apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-
like 3 (APOBEC3) family of cytidine deaminases (Sheehy et al.,
2002); the α-isoform of the tripartite motif-containing protein 5
(TRIM5α; Stremlau et al., 2004); the bone marrow stromal antigen
2 (Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008; BST-2, also known
as tetherin or CD317, referred to hereafter as BST-2), which is
the subject of this review article; and, more recently, SAMHD1
(Hrecka et al., 2011; Laguette et al., 2011). HIV-1, in turn, evolved
countermeasures to overcome the antiviral activity of their host
restriction factors, mainly by acquiring a series of trans-acting
viral accessory proteins, including Vif and Vpu. Vif blocks the
above-described APOBEC3 proteins that mediate extensive deam-
ination of cytosines in single-stranded viral DNA, thus halting

HIV replication. Vpu is another viral antagonist of the transmem-
brane BST-2 protein that blocks the release of enveloped viruses by
physically binding the budding viral particles to the membrane of
infected cells. Likewise, in HIV-2 and related simian immunodeﬁ-
ciency viruses, Vpx acts as an antagonist of SAMHD1 that blocks
HIV-1 replication in dendritic and myeloid cells. It should be noted
that HIV-1 is not susceptible to human TRIM5α antiviral action
(Stremlau et al., 2004). In this review, we focus on current advances
in structure-based analyses of BST-2 and viral antagonists.

BST-2: MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS
BST-2 is an interferon-induced type II membrane glycoprotein of
unusual topology (Ishikawa et al., 1995; Kupzig et al., 2003), which
efﬁciently blocks the release of diverse mammalian enveloped
viruses by directly tethering viral particles to the membranes
of infected cells. Viruses restricted by BST-2 are found among
diverse families,
including ﬁloviruses, arenaviruses, paramyx-
oviruses (Jouvenet et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Sakuma et al.,
2009a; Radoshitzky et al., 2010), gamma-herpesviruses (Mansouri
et al., 2009; Pardieu et al., 2010), rhabdoviruses (Weidner et al.,
2010), and a wide array of retroviruses from several mammal host
species (Arnaud et al., 2010; Dietrich et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011).

BST-2/tetherin versus its viral antagonists

A recent study characterizing a feline BST-2 ortholog reported
the protein’s strong activity against FIV particle release in vitro
(Dietrich et al., 2011). BST-2 comprises a short, 21-amino-acid
cytoplasmic N-terminal tail (CT), followed by an α-helical trans-
membrane (TM) domain, an extracellular domain (EC) that is
predominantly helical and contains an extended parallel coiled-
coil, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) compo-
nent that acts as a second anchor linking the protein back to the cell
membrane (Kupzig et al., 2003; Figure 1A). This double-anchor
topology is extremely unusual and is only shared by an isoform of
the prion protein (Moore et al., 1999).

Accumulating evidence supports the view that the struc-
tural features of BST-2 are key to its antiviral activity, as dis-
cussed in detail in the following sections. In agreement with
a direct tethering mechanism, a requirement for both the TM
and GPI anchors has been found for BST-2’s antiviral activ-
ity (Neil et al., 2008; Iwabu et al., 2009; Perez-Caballero et al.,
2009). Additionally, the EC of BST-2 contains a series of impor-
tant residues that are conserved throughout the protein’s mam-
malian orthologs, and these residues are essential to the inhibition
of viral release (Van Damme et al., 2008; Andrew et al., 2009;
Sakuma et al., 2009b). Whereas the stability of BST-2 is main-
tained by disulﬁde-links (Hinz et al., 2010; Schubert et al., 2010),
the EC forms an extended coiled-coil domain that contains sev-
eral conserved destabilizing amino acid residues, providing the
conformational ﬂexibility necessary for the molecule to sustain its
role as a physical tether, as described later. Salient BST-2 struc-
tural motifs important for antiviral function are summarized in
Table 1.

Based on the identiﬁcation of these structural features critical
for BST-2’s antiviral activity, Perez-Caballero et al. (2009) through
domain replacement experiments, were able to show that BST-
2’s conﬁguration rather than its primary sequence is critical for
antiviral activity. In an elegant demonstration, the authors gener-
ated a completely artiﬁcial BST-2-like protein made of structurally
similar domains from three unrelated heterologous proteins (the
TM from the transferrin receptor, the coiled-coil from dystrophia
myotonica protein kinase, and the GPI anchor from the uroki-
nase plasminogen activator receptor). Despite its lack of sequence
homology with native BST-2, this artiﬁcial protein reproduced the
latter’s antiviral activity as it was able to inhibit the release of HIV-1
and Ebola virus-like-particles.

BOTH TM AND GPI ANCHOR ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE
RESTRICTION OF VIRUS RELEASE
The TM (amino acid positions 22–43) of BST-2 is a short single-
pass α-helix that anchors the molecule to the plasma membrane,
while the GPI anchor is located at the C-terminal region of the pro-
tein (Kupzig et al., 2003). These two membrane anchors in part
determine the antiviral function of BST-2. This unusual topology
suggests a model that BST-2 directly tethers budding virions to
the membrane of infected cells. Indeed, unequivocal support for
this model has come from immunoelectron microscopy studies
demonstrating that BST-2 is associated with virions and located
between the viral and cell membranes as well as between tethered
virions (Neil et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2010; Hammonds et al.,
2010).

(TM) protein. BST-2 features a short cytoplasmic N-terminus followed by an
α-helical single-pass TM domain and an extended coiled-coil extracellular
domain that is linked back to the plasma membrane by a C-terminal GPI
anchor. N-glycosylation sites and cysteine residues for disulﬁde-bond
formation in the extracellular domain (EC) are noted. (B–D) Topological

Monomers are anchored in both membranes with opposing orientations.
(D) Membrane-spanning parallel model. Monomers are anchored in both
membranes with the same orientation.

As shown in Table 1, two structural elements are absolutely
required for BST-2-mediated restriction of viral release; (1) the
presence of both the TM and the GPI anchor (Neil et al., 2008;
Van Damme et al., 2008; Iwabu et al., 2009; Perez-Caballero et al.,
2009); and (2) homodimer formation through EC disulﬁde-bond
interactions (Andrew et al., 2009; Perez-Caballero et al., 2009).
The latter is discussed in greater detail in a later section of
this review. These two elements form the basis of the two pro-
posed topological models of BST-2. In the “EC self-interaction
model (Figure 1B),” individual BST-2 monomers are anchored at

both ends to the same membrane (cellular or viral), and interac-
tion between the EC domains of cell-bound and virion-bound
monomers is required for the restriction of virus release. The
alternative is the “membrane-spanning model (Figures 1C,D),”
in which both BST-2 end tails (TM and GPI anchor) are anchored
in different membranes (i.e., cellular and viral). Theoretically, the
BST-2 monomers in this model can be arranged in either an
anti-parallel (Figure 1C) or parallel (Figure 1D) conﬁguration.

The ﬁrst approach to resolve the topology of BST-2 involves
cleavage of the GPI anchor by treatment with the hydrolytic
enzyme phosphatidyl inositol-speciﬁc phospholipase C (Pi–PLC).
However, the enzymatic treatment does not effectively release
restricted virions from the cell membrane (Fitzpatrick et al., 2010),
supporting either a membrane-spanning anti-parallel conﬁgura-
tion (Figure 1C) or the EC self-interaction model (Figure 1B), in
which monomers would be able to remain attached to the respec-
tive membrane by the TM domain even after cleavage of the GPI
anchor.

The second approach is to evaluate the gap between the cel-
lular and viral membranes in electron microscopy studies. If the
BST-2 monomers are positioned parallel to the cellular and viral
membranes (EC self-interaction model; Figure 1B), virions would
be tethered very close to the membrane, less than 3–5 nm, as
described in (Hinz et al., 2010). However, imaging studies show
larger distances between virions and cells (Neil et al., 2008; Perez-
Caballero et al., 2009; Hammonds et al., 2010), thus supporting a
membrane-spanning model (Figures 1C,D).

The third approach to this problem has been the system-
atic determination of BST-2 function in mutational analyses. We
have previously shown that the anchoring of BST-2 through both
its N-terminal and C-terminal regions is required for antiviral
activity (Iwabu et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, mutagenesis studies using

GPI-anchor-deleted and CD4 signal peptide chimeric versions
of BST-2, in which the protein is linked to the cell mem-
brane only through one of its ends, showed that removal of
either end abrogated the antiviral effect of BST-2 on virus
production. Therefore, we concluded that membrane bind-
ing through both the TM and GPI anchor of BST-2 is crit-
ical
the
membrane-spanning parallel conﬁguration (Figure 1D). Fur-
ther evidence for this parallel-dimer model comes from the
analysis of residual BST-2 found in virions released through
proteolytic treatment with subtilisin (Perez-Caballero et al.,
2009).

for its antiviral activity, supporting the model of

Finally and more importantly, four different groups have
combined high-resolution crystallography (1.6–2.8Å), and small-
angle X-ray scattering-based modeling to determine the structures
of the entire human and murine BST-2 EC, and have shown
that BST-2 forms parallel coiled-coil arrangements (Hinz et al.,
2010; Schubert et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010a; Swiecki et al.,
2011). Taken together, these observations suggest that the antivi-
ral state of BST-2 present at the cell membrane corresponds to
the membrane-spanning parallel conﬁguration model as shown
in Figure 1D.

THE EC MEDIATES HOMODIMERIZATION
The BST-2 EC (amino acid positions 44–160) is predominantly
an α-helical coiled-coil structure that contains a series of residues
highly conserved among mammalian orthologs: two asparagines
that are N-linked glycosylation sites (N65, N92), and three cys-
teines (C53, C63, C91) responsible for intermolecular disulﬁde-
bonds that result in homodimerization (Figure 1A; Ohtomo et al.,
1999; Andrew et al., 2009). Disulﬁde linkage through these cys-
teine residues is critical for the restriction of HIV production

BST-2/tetherin versus its viral antagonists

(Table 1). Mutational analyses demonstrate that partial disulﬁde-
bond formation through at least one such cysteine residue is nec-
essary for the retention of antiviral activity, whereas mutations at
all three positions result in the total loss of antiviral function even
though expression of the protein at the cell membrane remains
unaltered (Andrew et al., 2009; Perez-Caballero et al., 2009; Hinz
et al., 2010), although this is not the case for ﬁlovirus or arenavirus
(Lassa virus) particles (Perez-Caballero et al., 2009; Sakuma et al.,
2009a).

Several conserved amino acids within the EC domain, which
are also thought to stabilize the dimers through weak coiled-
coil domain interactions, include two interhelical salt bridges
(E105–K106, and E133–R138) and one interhelical hydrogen bond
(N141), and contribute to stabilize the EC domain interface (Hinz
et al., 2010). Glycosylation of residues N65 and N92 was shown to
contribute to anterograde transport and correct protein folding,
but mutations in these positions had no effect on BST-2 antiviral
activity (Table 1; Andrew et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009a). In
summary, all evidence thus far suggests that BST-2 EC contains a
dimeric coiled-coil that is stabilized by C53–C53, C63–C63, and
C91–C91 disulﬁde-bonds, with the conservation of at least one of
these, along with weak interactions within the coiled-coil domain,
and is required for dimer stability and the antiviral activity of
BST-2.

THE BST-2 EC EXHIBITS CONFORMATIONAL FLEXIBILITY
The most recent structural studies provide valuable clues to the
biological function of the EC while at the same time reconciling
the topological models of BST-2 dimer conﬁguration with avail-
able electron microscopy data, as outlined above. Resolution of the
crystal structure of human BST-2 EC (Hinz et al., 2010; Schubert
et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010a) together with small-angle X-ray
scattering data suggest an elongated extracellular domain form-
ing a long rod-like structure and a greatly extended EC separating
the two membrane anchors, acting as a molecular ruler with a pre-
dicted distance of 170Å (Table 1). This distance would correspond
to the predicted separation between membrane-tethered virions
and the plasma membrane of the host cells, or between tethered
viral particles, and is in agreement with the separation determined
in published electron micrographic studies. This ﬁnding seems
to be consistent with the aforementioned membrane-spanning
model (Figure 1D).

The authors of those studies also described the presence of
irregularities in the 90-Å coiled-coil motif. The irregularities arise
from the introduction of destabilizing residues (see Table 1) that
are arranged regularly in core heptad positions, i.e., amino acid
residues located at the center of the α–helix. The destabilizing
residues loosen regular coiled-coil packing increasing the pitch
and radius of the α-helix, accounting for the low stability of BST-
2’s coiled-coil under reducing conditions in vitro. These positions
are conserved throughout all available BST-2 sequences, and their
mutations result in loss of the antiviral function of BST-2 (Hinz
et al., 2010). Yet, despite this intrinsic instability, the disulﬁde-
bonds are still able to be formed, restabilizing the EC domains
in a dimeric form. These ﬁndings suggest that conformational
ﬂexibility allows adaptation to the dynamic events of virion bud-
ding, while disulﬁde-bond-mediated dimerization prevents major

separation of the coiled-coils. Together, these two properties result
in a dynamic structure that permits dimer dissociation and resta-
bilization during the process of virion trapping (Hinz et al.,
2010; Swiecki et al., 2011). A high-resolution crystal structure of
the full-length mouse BST-2 EC conﬁrmed the presence of an
elongated EC characteristically unstable due to the insertion of
destabilizing residues (Swiecki et al., 2011). In that study, struc-
tural and biophysical analyses of murine and human BST-2 EC
domains revealed that an unstable coiled-coil motif is evolution-
arily conserved. This evidence provides further support for the
aforementioned model of conformational ﬂexibility.

THE GPI ANCHOR MEDIATES SURFACE LOCALIZATION AND
THE CT IS CRITICAL FOR BST-2 TRAFFICKING
BST-2 localizes both to the plasma membrane and internal com-
partments, particularly the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recy-
cling endosomes (Kupzig et al., 2003; Rollason et al., 2007; Dube
et al., 2009; Masuyama et al., 2009; Habermann et al., 2010). At the
cell surface, BST-2 localizes into cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts,
due to its GPI anchor. This localization is implicated in the pro-
motion of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Rollason et al., 2007;
Masuyama et al., 2009) and, importantly, it allows BST-2 to directly
interfere with the virion-release process, as lipid rafts are the pref-
erential site of budding of several enveloped viruses (Aloia et al.,
1993; Panchal et al., 2003; Waheed and Freed, 2009). This also
positions BST-2 at the virological synapse (VS; Casartelli et al.,
2010; Jolly et al., 2010; Pais-Correia et al., 2010), but its poten-
tial to restrict cell-to-cell viral spread remains controversial. With
respect to internalization and cell trafﬁcking, it was previously
shown that rodent BST-2 is internalized from the cell surface in
a clathrin-dependent manner (Rollason et al., 2007; Masuyama
et al., 2009). Internalization requires a non-canonical dual tyrosine
motif at amino acid positions 6 and 8 of the protein’s CT (YxY6–8;
Table 1). This motif is highly conserved through all mammalian
orthologs and sequentially participates in the interaction of BST-2
with the clathrin adaptors AP-2, which mediates internalization
by endocytosis, and AP-1, which retrieves BST-2 to the TGN. The
CT domain of BST-2 indirectly interacts with the underlying actin
cytoskeleton through a series of adaptor proteins (RICH2, EBP50,
ezrin), although additional studies are required to understand the
implications of these interactions for BST-2 function (Rollason
et al., 2009).

VIRAL ANTAGONISM OF BST-2
Since BST-2 targets the lipid bilayer of the host cell, viruses cannot
evade it simply by escape mutations. Therefore, enveloped viruses
had been obliged to evolve trans-acting countermeasures speciﬁ-
cally to overcome BST-2 restriction. Among primate lentiviruses,
three different viral gene products are known to antagonize BST-
2. In most SIV strains, the viral Nef protein antagonizes primate
BST-2, while in HIV-1 and HIV-2, the Vpu protein and the Env
glycoprotein, respectively, antagonize human BST-2. Other BST-2
antagonists include the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV) K5 protein and the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP). With
the exception of Ebola GP, all of these viral proteins downregulate
BST-2 at the plasma membrane, thus effectively removing it from
viral budding sites.

BST-2/tetherin versus its viral antagonists

HIV-1 Vpu
Just as the study of HIV-1 Vif led to the discovery of APOBEC3
as a host restriction factor (Sheehy et al., 2002), BST-2 was iden-
tiﬁed by searching for the host restriction factor antagonized by
the accessory viral protein Vpu. This 16-kDa type I transmem-
brane viral protein is a BST-2 antagonist and as such promotes
the release of HIV-1 virions (Cohen et al., 1988; Strebel et al.,
1988; Malim and Emerman, 2008). Importantly, Vpu can directly
mediate the removal of BST-2 away from its site of action on the
cell surface, although the mechanisms remain hotly debated (Van
Damme et al., 2008; Iwabu et al., 2009, 2010; Ruiz et al., 2010;
Lau et al., 2011). Thus far, it appears that Vpu recruits cellular
proteins to remove BST-2 from the surface (Figure 2A). As we
and others have shown, BST-2 downregulation by Vpu involves
a beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)-dependent
mechanism (Douglas et al., 2009; Iwabu et al., 2009; Mangeat
et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2009; Dubé et al., 2010; Tokarev et al.,
2011); however, this only partially explains the underlying mecha-
nism, since mutations in the β-TrCP-binding motif of Vpu do not
entirely abrogate its antagonism of BST-2 (Schubert and Strebel,
1994; Van Damme et al., 2008; Iwabu et al., 2009).

Whereas several reports suggest that BST-2 downregulation in
the presence of Vpu is accomplished at least in part through pro-
teasomal degradation (Gofﬁnet et al., 2009; Gupta et al., 2009a;
Mangeat et al., 2009), evidence obtained by our group and others
supports a model of BST-2 downregulation through lysosomal
degradation (Douglas et al., 2009; Iwabu et al., 2009; Mitchell
et al., 2009; Janvier et al., 2011). It is proposed that Vpu causes
the retention of BST-2 within endosomes by blocking its recy-
cling after endocytosis (Mitchell et al., 2009; Dubé et al., 2010; Lau
et al., 2011). Alternatively, it is hypothesized that Vpu inhibits the
membrane transport of BST-2 by causing its intracellular seques-
tration within the TGN (Dubé et al., 2010; Andrew et al., 2011; Lau
et al., 2011). We and others suggested that Vpu directly internal-
izes BST-2 from the cell surface through TM interactions leading
to lysosomes (Iwabu et al., 2009, 2010; Janvier et al., 2011; Skasko
et al., 2011a). An additional level of complexity in the BST-2 down-
regulation mechanism stems from a report that in certain cell lines
(CEMx174, H9), Vpu overexpression results in the enhancement
of virion production, but without effectively reducing the surface
levels of BST-2 (Miyagi et al., 2009). Thus, it is not yet clear how
Vpu affects the internalization, recycling, or membrane transport,
of BST-2.

Regardless of the mechanisms of Vpu-induced BST-2 down-
regulation, the ability of Vpu to bind to BST-2 is crucial for the
antagonism of BST-2-mediated restriction (Figure 2A), as evi-
denced by data showing that the anti-BST-2 activity of Vpu is
abrogated by mutations that disrupt TM-TM interaction. (Gupta
et al., 2009a; Iwabu et al., 2009; McNatt et al., 2009; Rong et al.,
2009; Skasko et al., 2011a). This interaction is highly speciﬁc
since single point mutations in either BST-2 (I34, L37, L41;
Table 1; Kobayashi et al., 2011) or Vpu (A14, A18, and W22;
Vigan and Neil, 2010) render BST-2 resistant to Vpu antagonism.
Their structural analyses showed that these residues form both
hydrophobic faces of the helices, and therefore presumably con-
tribute to their interacting surfaces. Recently, the aforementioned
residues have been shown by NMR spectroscopy to interact

directly in a membrane-embedded TM–TM interface (Skasko
et al., 2011b).

Importantly, a high degree of species-speciﬁcity characterizes
this interaction. Even though all primate BST-2 proteins are able to
block HIV-1 virion-release, non-human BST-2 proteins are mostly
insensitive to Vpu antagonism (Gofﬁnet et al., 2009; Gupta et al.,
2009a; Jia et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Analyses of codon-
speciﬁc positive selection in the primate lineage showed that a
mutation of residue T45 in human BST-2 is sufﬁcient to reduce
its sensitivity to Vpu (Gupta et al., 2009a). Likewise, the transfer
of amino acid positions 30–45 of the human BST-2 TM domain
into rhesus BST-2 was sufﬁcient to render it Vpu-sensitive, while
a single I48T mutation in rhesus BST-2 conferred partial Vpu
sensitivity (Yoshida et al., 2011). These results suggest that this
speciﬁcity of HIV-1 Vpu for BST-2 depends on conserved amino
acids in the latter’s TM domain (as described above) that are
divergent between the human protein and its simian counterparts.

OTHER BST-2 ANTAGONISTS
Most of the primate lentiviruses that do not encode a Vpu protein
instead use Nef to counteract BST-2’s antiviral function (Jia et al.,
2009; Sauter et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). It should be noted that
even though the primate ancestors of HIV-1, SIVcpz, and SIVgor
from chimpanzees and gorillas encode Vpu, they also use Nef to
antagonize BST-2 (Sauter et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010b). Analo-
gous to HIV-1 Vpu antagonism of human and chimpanzee, but not
other primate BST-2 proteins (Gofﬁnet et al., 2009; McNatt et al.,
2009; Hauser et al., 2010), SIV Nef counteracts primate but not
human BST-2 orthologs. This selectivity resides in the CT of non-
human primate BST-2, which contains a discreet DDIWK14–18
sequence (Table 1) that is required for the response to SIV Nef
but is deleted in the protein’s human counterparts (Sauter et al.,
2009; Lim et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010b). Furthermore, antag-
onism of non-human primate BST-2 is abrogated by mutations
in the myristoylation site of SIV Nef (Figure 2B; Jia et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2009). In addition, SIV Nef mutations that impair
CD4 and CD28 downregulation also abrogate BST-2 antagonism,
suggesting a similar mechanism of interaction (Zhang et al., 2009).
By contrast, BST-2 antagonism by some strains of HIV-2 (as well
as SIVtan from Tantalus monkeys) is mediated by the Env gly-
coprotein (Figure 2C; Bour and Strebel, 1996; Ritter et al., 1996;
Abada et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 2009b). Although the exact deter-
minants of interaction are not well understood, an endocytic motif
(GYxxφ) in the cytoplasmic region of gp41 (Boge et al., 1998) is
known to be required to bind to AP-2, triggering BST-2 downreg-
ulation (Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009), while extracellular domains
of HIV-2 Env apparently bind to the EC of BST-2. It was recently
reported that an A100D point mutation of BST-2’s EC abrogates
the HIV-2 Env-mediated block of BST-2 restriction (Gupta et al.,
2009b), supporting a model of interaction between HIV-2 Env and
the EC of BST-2.

Other BST-2 antagonists include KSHV K5 protein, which
ubiquitinates K18 residue in the CT domain of BST-2 (Table 1),
leading to reduced surface and intracellular levels of BST-2, pre-
sumably through an endolysosomal process (Figure 2D; Mansouri
et al., 2009; Pardieu et al., 2010). The Ebola virus GP2 appears
to use a novel non-sequence-speciﬁc mechanism, overcoming

BST-2/tetherin versus its viral antagonists

FIGURE 2 | Viral antagonists of BST-2 and their domains of interaction.
Schematic representation of BST-2 and its known antagonists. The structural
domains of interaction are indicated by red arrows. (A) HIV-1 Vpu and BST-2
interact through their mutual transmembrane (TM) domains. Key amino acid
residues involved in the interaction are depicted in the TM helices. Also
shown is the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex required for BST-2
internalization. (B) SIV Nef recognizes the cytoplasmic (CT) domain of BST-2.
The AP-2 clathrin adaptor recruited for BST-2 internalization is also shown.

Myr, myristoylation site. (C) The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-2 and
SIVtan binds to BST-2 through their mutual ectodomains (EC), and recruitment
of AP-2 by the CT domain of Env required for internalization is also shown. (D)
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K5 protein that is an
ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates a target lysine motif in the CT domain of BST-2,
resulting in its internalization. (E) The antagonistic mechanisms of the Ebola
virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) are unclear, but require interaction between
GP2 subunit of EBOV–GP and BST-2 EC.

BST-2’s restriction without signiﬁcant removal of the protein from
the cell surface (Figure 2E; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Lopez et al., 2010;
Kühl et al., 2011). Inﬂuenza virus is suspected of harboring an
unidentiﬁed viral antagonist against BST-2, since BST-2 expression
was unable to block replication-competent inﬂuenza virus pro-
duction but inhibited the release of inﬂuenza virus-like-particles
(Watanabe et al., 2011).

CONCLUSION
Considerable progress was made recently in understanding the
structure and function of BST-2, as well as the mechanisms
by which viral antagonists counteract its activity. Through a

combination of biological studies and structural analyses, the
functional state of BST-2 is characterized as that of a parallel
dimeric coiled-coil that, via its double-membrane anchors, physi-
cally binds budding virions to the infected cell. More importantly,
current evidence shows that the unusual structural features of
BST-2 determine its antiviral function independently of sequence
homology. The EC has a prime role acting as a molecular ruler
that separates the membrane anchors, in addition to allowing
dimerization of BST-2 and providing conformational ﬂexibility
to sustain the protein’s function as a viral particle tether. Likewise,
loss of BST-2’s double-membrane anchoring leads to the complete
abrogation of the antiviral activity.

BST-2/tetherin versus its viral antagonists

Although most of the evidence presented here was obtained
from in vitro systems, a recent study using BST-2 knockout mice
has shown that BST-2 inhibited the replication and release of a
murine retrovirus in vivo, in a manner completely dependent on
IFN-α production. Additionally, BST-2 restricted viral pathogene-
sis and delayed disease progression, suggesting that it has veriﬁable
antiviral activity not only in vitro but also in vivo. (Liberatore
and Bieniasz, 2011). Another study using rhesus macaques has
conﬁrmed the importance of the antagonism of BST-2 antiviral
activity by Vpu in vivo (Shingai et al., 2011). Further investigation

of the antiviral mechanisms exerted by host restriction factors,
as well as the evolution of viral countermeasures, will not only
advance our understanding of AIDS pathogenesis but also lead to
the development of therapeutic alternatives.
