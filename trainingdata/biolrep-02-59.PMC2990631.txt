Abstract
Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is rapidly evolving and is starting to be utilized by the clinical field
as well as diagnostics. We describe major recent advances that have come about as a result of the
application of MPS in the biomedical field and the first approaches in medical genetics that have made
use of MPS. Without any doubt, MPS has proven to be a very powerful technique. To unravel the
capabilities of MPS for patient care, the most important aspect for the acceptance of MPS within
clinics and diagnostics is to guarantee that the large amount of data undergoes vitally important
analyses and interpretation and is securely managed.

Introduction and context
The evolution of the so-called next- or second-generation
sequencing technologies has been extremely rapid
during the last 4 years. This is supposed to continue as
the third generation of sequencers starts to enter the
market with new approaches and devices that enable
longer read lengths and shorter analysis time. Compa-
nies such as Pacific Biosciences (Menlo Park, CA, USA)
promise to enable sequencing of samples in a few
minutes to address the needs of diagnostics. However,
the second-generation platforms such as the FLX from
Roche (Basel, Switzerland), the Genome Analyzer from
Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA), and the SOLiD platform
from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) have
proven to be very powerful tools for genomic analyses
and have transformed biomedical science by opening up
fascinating new opportunities. So far, the majority of
projects performed on these platforms have been in the
basic or biomedical research context. This might change
by the recently achieved and more streamlined work-
flows for all commercially-available next-generation
sequencing platforms. To appeal to smaller labs and
the diagnostics market, the three leading manufacturers
(Roche, Illumina, and Applied Biosystems) started to

launch smaller-scaled devices. These instruments enable
more flexibility and shorter processing times at reduced
throughput.

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) enables simulta-
neous screening of thousands of loci for disease-causing
mutations, structural rearrangements, or epigenetic
changes. On the RNA level, mutational analysis, post-
transcriptional modifications, and the profiling of abun-
dant transcripts become possible in one experiment. MPS
is, for example, by far the best technique to analyze allele-
specific expression or splicing, RNA editing, or to follow
the exact genotype of the sequences involved in copy
number variation (CNV). The strength of this technology
is to allow investigators to look at several aspects in one
single experiment. This allows many complex analyses to
be simplified and probably will lead to the replacement of
other technologies such as microarrays, which have been
shown to be useful in the diagnostic setting (for instance,
in the classification of cancer types) [1-3]. In contrast to
microarray-based techniques, sequencing is essentially
digital and therefore can provide almost unlimited
accuracy (depending on the sequencing depth). However,
the prospects of these enormous capacities have to be well

balanced with the requirements associated with daily
routine use in diagnostics. In particular, a simple work-
flow with few requirements on sample preparation and
barcoding, a reasonable time per operation, easy bioinfor-
matics, and (last but not least) manageable costs for the
instrument,
its operation, and data management are
obligatory. Other questions frequently discussed in the
community, such as the required read length or the read
quality, depend greatly on the planned application.

Major recent advances
In regard to the biological target, the analysis of genetic
variation such as mutational analysis and structural
variants is of major interest in diagnostics. The classical
way of detecting causative mutations has been amplicon
sequencing. An application of amplicon sequencing on
MPS was shown by Varley and Mitra [4], who combined a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based enrichment
approach to extract 94 exons from six genes that cause
cancer when mutated in the germline (TP53, APC, MLH1,
RB1, BRCA1, and VHL) using the 454 sequencing
approach. But the technology itself is not limited to a
few exons or amplicons. An example of genome-wide
analysis was shown by Lupski and colleagues [5]. To
unravel the causative mutations in a patient with Charcot-
Marie-Tooth neuropathy, whole-genome sequencing was
performed and clinically relevant variants were identified
in the causative alleles, providing diagnostic information
for the care of these patients [5]. Nevertheless, in the near
future (1-3 years), it is more likely that analyses will be
performed on target regions in diagnostics. The regions
might differ from kilobases to megabases, and focus on
specific loci, but with the improvement of data reduction
and computation-aided analysis tools, the size of regions
will increase in the coming years and finally we might
end up on the genome-wide scale. However, recent work
has shown the usefulness of targeted MPS. Choi and
colleagues [6] made an unanticipated genetic diagnosis of
congenital chloride diarrhea in a patient referred with a
suspected diagnosis of Bartter syndrome. The molecular
diagnosis was based on the finding of a homozygous
missense mutation and could be confirmed by clinical
follow-up [6]. Ng et al. [7] successfully identified a
candidate gene causing the Miller syndrome by using
exome enrichment
followed by MPS and successive
mutation analysis. An example of a further candidate for
the targeted approach is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM), a heterogeneous autosomal dominant cardiac
disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 500. So far, more than
450 different pathogenic mutations in at least 16 genes
have been identified with alternative techniques. The large
allelic and genetic heterogeneity of HCM requires high-
throughput, rapid, and affordable mutation detection
technologies, which can be provided by MPS [8].

A significant advantage of MPS is the ability to detect
even rare variants, which are not represented in the
common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
usually scored by array-based SNP genotyping techni-
ques. Rare variants were recently shown to be signifi-
cantly correlated with the risk for schizophrenia, whereas
no significant association could be found for common
variants [9]. The comprehensive assessment of variants
for a patient in a single experiment can be used to
determine dose requirements and the susceptibility to
adverse drug effects of current and future novel drugs.
However, sequencing, in parallel, will provide informa-
tion on CNVs and translocations and therefore will help
to get a much more complete picture of all potentially
relevant changes in the genome. MPS also allows easy
integration of information on the transcriptome (expres-
sion levels, splicing, and RNA editing), DNA methyla-
tions (e.g., by the use of MeDIP [methylated DNA
immunoprecipitation]-based procedures), or protein-
DNA interactions (chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing [ChIP-seq]) on the same material. This is
particularly interesting for cancer treatment. Experiences
from sequencing tumor genomes have shown that
tumors typically have tens of thousands of somatic
changes, making every tumor different and therefore
making the response of every patient to a particular
treatment an individual response. It is now well under-
stood that tumors of identical clinical classification may
require very different
treatments [10]. The genetic
instability and clonal evolution of cancer genomes lead
to very heterogeneous tissues. This can result in the
misleading interpretation of data coming from array-
based or PCR-based analyses. At a sufficient depth of
coverage, MPS enables the quantification of even low
abundant sequences and thus their accurate detection.

Diagnosis should be as non-invasive a process as possible.
MPS represents a new approach that
is potentially
applicable to non-invasive diagnosis in all body fluids.
This was shown by Chiu et al. [11] for maternal plasma
samples, which were screened for fetal chromosomal
aneuploidies. For epigenetic changes of cell-free DNA in
blood, a similar approach is applicable as well, as it has
been shown that these mutations may act as diagnostic
or early detection/risk markers for cancer [12]. In this
context, targeted approaches [13] and genome-wide
approaches [14] have been demonstrated to access the
methylation status. Alternatively, genome-wide histone
modifications have been identified by combining ChIP
with MPS [15].

For detection and quantification of viral or bacterial
populations, MPS provides the ability to identify rare
or even currently unknown microorganisms by their

sequence. Recent examples have shown a combination
of
targeted enrichment of an informative genomic
sequence followed by deep sequencing. Claesson and
colleagues [16] used the V4 and V6 regions of 16S
ribosomal RNA genes in bacterial DNA to decipher the
microbial spectrum in the human intestinal tract. Holtz
et al. [17] identified a new picornavirus by phylogenetic
analysis of deep sequencing data of a sample derived
from a patient. Wang and colleagues [18] used ultra-deep
pyrosequencing to detect minor sequence variants in
HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase genes from
clinical plasma samples. With appropriate analysis, ultra-
deep sequencing is a promising method for characteriz-
ing genetic diversity and detecting minor yet clinically
relevant variants in biological samples with complex
genetic populations. For a wide range of applications, the
short-read-delivering technologies (not more than 201
base pairs) are well suited and are advantageous in
regard to throughput and costs per experiment. But to
distinguish between different species with a high degree
of homology or to detect structural variants, longer reads
are required. Paired-end and mate-pair sequencing can
help to circumvent this [19]. But the complex sample
preparation procedure and the required high amounts of
input DNA make mate-pair sequencing in particular
improper for routine diagnostics.

Next-generation sequencers produce an enormous
amount of data. Currently, the instruments have a weekly
data output of approximately 400 gigabytes to 1 terabyte.
Large genome centers are prepared to deal with this, but
the majority of diagnostics laboratories are not. Tremen-
dous computing and storage capacities are still needed
at the moment. Cloud computing is discussed as one
possible way to circumvent investments of zillions of
dollars from the diagnostics community in information
technology infrastructure [20]. Langmead and colleagues
[21] recently reported the development of software that
uses cloud computing to enable the analysis of a human
genome within one day. Currently, the transfer of data is
still limiting, facing potentially hundreds of gigabytes of
data from a single experiment. However, the concerted
improvements of data size reduction and data transfer
capacities might solve this in the near future. For the
handling of patient data, data safety is of particular
concern. Standards for the privacy and security of health-
related data have to be established. Superior in this respect
leader Amazon (Seattle, WA, USA). The
is market
company committed itself
to data security by its
compliance with the Health Insurance Portability Act
[20]. Besides the technical issues that need to be solved,
there are ethical questions. Patients will gain a huge
amount of information describing potential risks and
genetic predispositions. Future advances in medical

research could mean that people end up discovering
things that they might not have wanted to know, an issue
that needs to be resolved both ethically and legally.

Future directions
By looking at the requirements of smaller and diagnostics
laboratories, companies have started to launch smaller
devices and more streamlined workflows, which enable
the continuous analysis of many samples within a
relatively short period of time. We expect that, in the
next 1-3 years, targeted enrichment will enable the set up
of disease-focused applications. This, in combination with
barcoding, gives the flexibility needed in the diagnostics
setting. On the other hand, we can expect sequencing costs
to drop further, sequencing speed to increase dramatically,
and third-generation sequencing techniques, based (for
example) on fluorescence detection (Pacific Biosciences),
alternative detection systems (Ion Torrent, Guilford, CT,
USA), or nanopore-based techniques (Oxford Nanopore
Technologies Ltd, Oxford, UK), to allow the routine
determination of the sequence of entire genomes at low
cost in less than an hour. Therefore, at sufficiently low cost
and sufficiently high speed, whole-genome/transcriptome
sequencing, in the long run, might be as cost-effective as
enrichment-based strategies.

In the context of diagnostics, simpler sample preparation
is needed as are new methods to handle data and
to assess statistical significance without immense bioin-
formatics support in the clinical routine. Quality metrics
will help to access technical reproducibility, accuracies
of raw base calls, or systematic error patterns. Cloud
computing providing standard analysis pipelines might
be an option for data analysis, but the data safety issue
has to be solved technically as well as legally. Data
storage and transfer have to be of major concern in the
near future so that we are prepared for the application
of this technology in diagnostics. This will crucially
influence the arrival of MPS in diagnostics.

Methods for data storage, management, and analysis
and the suitable workflow to fit into diagnostics are
technologically-oriented developments needed to tightly
link MPS to diagnostics routine. A major difficulty,
however, will be to efficiently transform the large amounts
of sequence information, which are increasingly easy to
generate, into clinically relevant information. For this, few
systematic approaches are seen in the field. One example is
the Treat 1000 project [22], which is going to develop
individually optimized treatments for patients with cancer.
Modeling tools will be used to generate models of the drug
response of individual patients on the basis of data
obtained by deep sequencing of the genome and tran-
scriptome of the tumor and the genome of the patient.

Although such tools are promising, we still need additional
biological knowledge of complex disorders in order to
develop robust models into which the obtained compre-
hensive data are fed. It is hoped that the safe interpretation
and prediction that result from this will
lead to a
personalized medical care that earns the trust of the patient.
