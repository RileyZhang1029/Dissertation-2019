Human enterovirus species A (HEV-A) is one of the four species of HEV in the genus
Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. Among HEV-A, coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and
enterovirus 71 (EV71) are the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease
(HFMD). Some other types of HEV-A are commonly associated with herpangina. Although
HFMD and herpangina due to HEV-A are common febrile diseases among infants and
children, EV71 can cause various neurological diseases, such as aseptic meningitis and
fatal encephalitis. Recently, two human transmembrane proteins, P-selectin glycoprotein
ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2), were identiﬁed
as functional receptors for EV71 and CVA16. In in vitro infection experiments using the
prototype HEV-A strains, PSGL-1 and SCARB2 could be responsible for the speciﬁc recep-
tors for EV71 and CVA16. However, the involvement of both receptors in the in vitro and
in vivo infections of clinical isolates of HEV-A has not been clariﬁed yet. To elucidate a
diverse array of the clinical outcome of HEV-A-associated diseases, the identiﬁcation and
characterization of HEV-A receptors may provide useful information in understanding the
HEV-A pathogenesis at a molecular level.

INTRODUCTION
The genus Enterovirus within family Picornaviridae, non-
enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive
polarity, is comprised of more than 100 serotypes (Pallansch and
Roos, 2007). Human enteroviruses (HEVs) are presently classiﬁed
into four species, HEV species A, B, C, and D (HEV-A, B, C, and
D). At present, coxsackievirus A2 (CVA2), CVA3, CVA4, CVA5,
CVA6, CVA7, CVA8, CVA10, CVA12, CVA14, CVA16, enterovirus
71 (EV71), EV76, EV89, EV90, EV91, and EV92 have been classi-
ﬁed as HEV-A (Oberste et al., 2004, 2005, 2008). In addition, four
types of simian enteroviruses are classiﬁed as HEV-A (Oberste
et al., 2007). Although most enterovirus infections are asympto-
matic, particular clinical manifestations are associated with spe-
ciﬁc types of enteroviruses (Pallansch and Roos, 2007). CVA2,
CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, and CVA10 are commonly associated with
herpangina. EV71 and CVA16 are major causative agents of hand,
foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a common febrile disease occur-
ring mainly in young children, characterized by skin rash involving
palms and soles, and ulcers on oral mucosa. Recently, HFMD out-
breaks mainly due to CVA6 have been reported (Fujimoto et al.,
2012). Clinical manifestations of HFMD caused by EV71, CVA6,
and CVA16 are usually mild and self-limited. However, EV71 infec-
tion causes a diverse range of neurological diseases, such as aseptic
meningitis, acute ﬂaccid paralysis, brainstem encephalitis, and
neurogenic pulmonary edema, and may result in long-term neuro-
logical sequelae, mainly in infants and young children (Alexander
et al., 1994; McMinn, 2002; Modlin, 2007).

Recently, two human transmembrane proteins, P-selectin gly-
coprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1; Nishimura et al., 2009) and scavenger
receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2; Yamayoshi et al., 2009),
were identiﬁed as functional receptors for EV71 and CVA16 (Patel
and Bergelson, 2009). In addition, annexin II (Yang et al., 2011),

sialic acid (SA; Yang et al., 2009), and dendritic cell (DC)-speciﬁc
ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; Lin et al., 2009b) were
found to be cellular factors involved in the early stages of EV71
infection. This review summarizes our current understanding of
the EV71/CVA16 receptors and their role in HEV-A infection.

P-SELECTIN GLYCOPROTEIN LIGAND-1
Patients with severe EV71-associated encephalitis and neurologi-
cal pulmonary edema showed a signiﬁcant depletion of T cells and
high levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines (Lin et al., 2003; Wang
et al., 2003), suggesting the possible involvement of lymphocytes
in EV71 infection and the immunopathogenesis. Therefore, we
generated a cDNA library from Jurkat T cells and used it for expres-
sion cloning to identify a receptor on lymphocytes that speciﬁcally
binds to EV71. Finally we identiﬁed PSGL-1 as a functional EV71
receptor on Jurkat T cells (Nishimura et al., 2009).

P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 is a sialomucin leukocyte
membrane protein expressed as a homodimer of disulﬁde-linked
subunits and it can bind to three different selectins (P, E, and L;
Sako et al., 1993; Laszik et al., 1996; Somers et al., 2000). The tis-
sue distribution of PSGL-1 is restricted to myeloid, lymphoid, and
dendritic lineages, and platelets. PSGL-1 is also expressed on DCs
of lymph nodes and macrophages in the intestinal mucosa (Laszik
et al., 1996), which could be the primary sites of EV71 replication.
PSGL-1 plays critical roles in the tethering and rolling of leuko-
cytes for the recruitment of cells from blood vessels to the sites of
acute inﬂammation upon stimulation by infection.

We found that some representative EV71 strains bind to PSGL-
1 but other strains did not (Nishimura et al., 2009). According
to their PSGL-1 binding capability, we classiﬁed the EV71 isolates
as PSGL-1 binding strains (EV71-PB) and PSGL-1-non-binding
strains (EV71-non-PB). The replication of EV71-PB in Jurkat T

HEV-A receptors

cells was inhibited by anti-PSGL-1 monoclonal antibody (KPL1),
indicating that EV71-PB replicated in Jurkat cells in a PSGL-1-
dependent manner. On the other hand, EV71 replicated in non-
leukocyte cells (such as RD cells) expressing little or no PSGL-1,
and the replication was not affected by KPL1. Therefore we con-
clude that EV71 does not use PSGL-1 as the major cellular receptor
on RD cells and other receptor(s), including SCARB2 or annexin
II, may be responsible for EV71 infection in non-leukocyte cells
expressing little or no PSGL-1.

Post-translational modiﬁcations of

the N-terminal region
of PSGL-1 contribute the efﬁcient binding to selectins and
chemokines (Pouyani and Seed, 1995; Sako et al., 1995; Wilkins
et al., 1995; Liu et al., 1998; Hirata et al., 2004). In this region, there
are a potential O-glycosylation residue (T57) and three potential
tyrosine sulfation sites (Y46, Y48, and Y51). We demonstrated that
tyrosine sulfation, not O-glycosylation, of the N-terminal region
of PSGL-1 facilitates its binding to EV71-PB and viral replication
in Jurkat T cells (Nishimura et al., 2010).

Coxsackievirus A16 is genetically and antigenically related to
EV71 and is a major causative agent of HFMD as well as EV71
(Oberste et al., 2004). The inoculation of L-PSGL-1.1 cells, mouse
L929 cells stably expressing human PSGL-1, with the proto-
type CVA16-G-10 strain induced faint cytopathic effects (CPE)
(Nishimura et al., 2009). The replication of CVA16-G-10 was
partially inhibited by KPL1 in L-PSGL-1.1 cells. This result indi-
cated that the prototype CVA16 strain may use human PSGL-1
and another unidentiﬁed receptor(s) to infect L-PSGL-1.1 cells.
CVA16-G-10 replication in Jurkat cells was not apparently inhib-
ited by KPL1 (Nishimura et al., 2009), but signiﬁcantly inhibited
by a sulfation inhibitor, sodium chlorate (Nishimura et al., 2010).
Therefore some sulfated molecules other than PSGL-1 might be
involved in the replication of CVA16 in Jurkat cells. CVA16-G-
10 would use unidentiﬁed receptor(s) to infect Jurkat T cells
(Nishimura et al., 2009; Patel and Bergelson, 2009).

To investigate the PSGL-1-dependent replication phenotype of
HEV-A, we tested the replication of 10 prototype HEV-A strains in
L-PSGL-1.1 cells in the presence or absence of KPL1 (Figure 1A).
On day 6 post-inoculation, there was no signiﬁcant replication of
CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, or CVA8 in L-bsd cells (blasticidin-resistant
control L929 cells) or L-PSGL-1.1 cells. Although higher viral
titers were found for CVA2 and CVA7 in L-PSGL-1.1 cells com-
pared with those in L-bsd cells, replication was not affected by
KPL1. These results suggest that CVA2 and CVA7 may infect to
L-PSGL-1.1 cells in an alternative pathway via PSGL-1 or glyco-
sylated PSGL-1, without the interaction between EV71-PB and
the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 recognized by KPL1. We could
not demonstrate any PSGL-1-dependent replication of the CVA3,
CVA10, CVA12, and CVA14 strains in L-PSGL-1.1 cells, because
they replicated even in PSGL-1 negative L-bsd cells as previ-
ously reported for certain HEV-A ﬁeld isolates (Nadkarni and
Deshpande, 2003; Yamayoshi et al., 2009).

Coxsackievirus A7 and CVA14 infection induced CPE in L-
PSGL-1.1 cells, but not in L-bsd cells (Table 1). On the other hand,
CVA7 and CVA14 induced CPE in L-Empty cells (puromycin-
resistant control L929 cells; Table 1; Yamayoshi et al., 2009). The
difference in the CPE induction by some HEV-A strains might be
due to the maintenance or cultivation conditions of the mouse

L929-derived cells regardless of the receptor expression of PSGL-1
or SCARB2. Some strains of HEV-A are able to infect mouse L929
cells regardless of expression of PSGL-1 or SCARB2 (Nadkarni and
Deshpande, 2003; Yamayoshi et al., 2009). It is therefore impossible
to determine receptor usage of HEV-A by simply investigating the
susceptibility of mouse L929 cells expressing the putative cellular
receptor. Receptor usage of HEV-A should be determined care-
fully by showing several lines of evidence such as acquisition of
susceptibility by expressing a putative receptor in non-susceptible
cells, loss of susceptibility by knocking down of the receptor in
susceptible cells, and direct binding of the virus to the receptor, etc.
L-PSGL-1.1 cells did not support PSGL-1-dependent replica-
tion of the HEV-B and HEV-C strains (Figure 1B); however, the
prototype EV70 strain (HEV-D) replicated in L-PSGL-1.1 cells
more efﬁciently than in L-bsd cells. Although EV70 replication
was not affected by KPL1 (Figure 1B), we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that EV70 utilizes α2,3-linked SA, which could be a receptor
for EV70 (Nokhbeh et al., 2005).

Recently we reported that that four out of ﬁve EV71-PB strains
replicated poorly in L-PSGL-1.1 cells (Miyamura et al., 2011). We
found that EV71 variants, which were propagated once in L-PSGL-
1.1 cells, have several possible adaptive mutations, including a
putative amino acid determinant of the adaptive phenotype in
L-PSGL-1.1 cells at VP2-149 (Miyamura et al., 2011). The results
suggest that adaptive mutations, along with a PB phenotype, may
facilitate efﬁcient PSGL-1-dependent replication of the EV71 vari-
ants in L-PSGL-1.1 cells. It is possible that HEV-A strains other
than EV71 also require adaptive mutations for efﬁcient replication
in L-PSGL-1.1 cells.

SCAVENGER RECEPTOR CLASS B, MEMBER 2
Yamayoshi et al. (2009) identiﬁed SCARB2 (also known as lysoso-
mal integral membrane protein II, or CD36b like-2) as an EV71
receptor on RD cells, widely used for isolation of EV71 from
clinical specimens. They transfected EV71-non-susceptible mouse
L929 cells with the genomic DNA of RD cells and selected two cell
clones that were susceptible for EV71 infection. By a transcriptome
analysis, SCARB2 was identiﬁed as an EV71 receptor on RD cells.
Scavenger receptor class B, member 2 is a heavily N -
glycosylated type III transmembrane protein consists from 478
amino acids and belongs to the CD36 family of scavenger recep-
tor proteins (Fujita et al., 1992; Calvo et al., 1995). SCARB2
has a N-terminal transmembrane domain, a ∼400 amino acid
lumeral domain, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and a
C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of ∼20 amino acids (Fujita et al.,
1992). SCARB2 involves in an enlargement of early endosomes
and late endosomes/lysosomes and an impairment of endocytic
membrane out of the enlarged compartments (Kuronita et al.,
2002). SCARB2 deﬁciency caused ureteric pelvic junction obstruc-
tion, deafness, and peripheral neuropathy in mice (Gamp et al.,
2003). SCARB2 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues (Eske-
linen et al., 2003); therefore, it might be involved in systemic EV71
infections (Yamayoshi et al., 2009).

Human SCARB2 has 10 potential N -glycosylation sites (Fujita
et al., 1992). But the carbohydrate chains of human SCARB2
are not essential for the interaction between EV71 and human
SCARB2 (Yamayoshi and Koike, 2011). Experiments using a

inoculated with viruses at 10 CCID50/cell for 1 h, washed, and incubated in the
medium, as described previously (Nishimura et al., 2009). Cells were
incubated at 34˚C. For mAb inhibition, the cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml
mAb for 1 h, washed, and maintained in the medium with 10 μg/ml mAb. At
the indicated time [just after infection (0 h) and 6 days postinfection (6 d)], the
infected cells and supernatants were freeze-thawed and viral titers were
determined by CCID50 titration using RD cells. The titers are expressed as the

identiﬁed that the amino acids 142–204 of human SCARB2
(encoded by human SCARB2 exon 4) are responsible for EV71
binding and infection (Yamayoshi and Koike, 2011).

Mouse L929 cells expressing human SCARB2 in the presence
of puromycin (L-SCARB2 cells) permitted the replication of all
EV71 strains tested, including the non-PB strains (Yamayoshi et al.,
2009). CVA16 induced CPE in L-SCARB2 cells, whereas CVA2,
CVA3, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA8, and CVA12 did not. CVA16
grew efﬁciently in L-SCARB2, whereas CVA2, CVA3, CVA4, CVA5,
CVA6, CVA8, and CVA12 did not (Table 1). Yamayoshi et al. (2009)
concluded that CVA16 also infect L-SCARB2 cells in a SCARB2-
dependent manner and that infection with most other HEV-A is
not dependent upon SCARB2. CVA7, CVA10, and CVA14 induced

CPE in both L-Empty cells and L-SCARB2 cells (Yamayoshi et al.,
2009). They could not determine whether the CPE induced by
these viruses were due to human SCARB2–mediated infection.

ANNEXIN II
Yang et al. (2011) identiﬁed annexin II as an EV71 VP1-binding
protein on RD cells. Using a recombinant VP1 protein of EV71
fused with a calmodulin-binding peptide, they tried to identify
VP1-binding proteins from the total cellular proteins of RD cells.
A virus-overlay protein-binding assay followed by a mass spec-
trometry analysis identiﬁed annexin II as a VP1-binding protein.
Annexin II is a member of the annexin family – the multifunc-
tional phospholipid-binding proteins. Annexin II on the surface
of endothelial cells acts as a proﬁbrinolytic coreceptor for both

plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator facilitating the gen-
eration of plasmin (Kim and Hajjar, 2002). The interaction to
annexin II was speciﬁc to EV71; CVA16 did not bind to annexin II
in the virus-overlay protein-binding assay (Yang et al., 2011).

SIALIC ACID
Sialic acid is usually found as terminal monosaccharides on the
glycan chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins (Varki and Varki,
2007). Coxsackievirus A24 variant (CVA24v) uses SA-containing
glycoconjugates as attachment receptors on corneal cells (Nils-
son et al., 2008). Yang et al. (2009) hypothesized that SA would
be important for EV71 infection, as the transmission route of
EV71 and CVA24v is fecal-oral and/or droplet-aerosol route. EV71
infection to DLD-1 intestinal cells was inhibited by an O-glycan
synthesis inhibitor, but not by an N -glycan synthesis inhibitor.
Sialidase treatment decreased EV71 replication in DLD-1 cells.
Furthermore, DLD-1 cells co-cultured with SA-linked galactose
signiﬁcantly reduced the EV71 infection. Thus Yang et al. (2009)
concluded that SA-linked glycans are EV71 receptors on DLD-
1 cells. Recently, Neu5Acα2,3Gal disaccharides on PSGL-1 were
reported as a candidate receptor of CVA24v (Mistry et al., 2011).
It is unknown whether other enteroviruses, including HEV-A,
recognize SA-containing glycans as the entry receptors.

DENDRITIC CELL-SPECIFIC ICAM3-GRABBING
NON-INTEGRIN
Dendritic cells play crucial roles in antiviral immunity by func-
tioning as professional antigen-presenting cells to prime T cells
and by secreting cytokines to modulate immune responses. In a
mouse model of EV71 infection, DCs from the brains of EV71-
infected, but not of uninfected, mice expressed viral antigen and

reported that EV71 infection enhances mouse DCs to elicit pro-
tective immune response and also found that EV71 infects human
immature DCs and that viral entry is partially inhibited by anti-
DC-SIGN antibody. However, the direct interaction between EV71
and DC-SIGN is still unclear. It is essential to characterize the role
of DC-SIGN and other receptors for EV71 in DCs for understand-
ing the host immunological responses and immunopathogenesis
of HEV-A including EV71.

CONCLUSION
Identiﬁcation of PSGL-1 and SCARB2 as the cellular receptors
for EV71 and CVA16 has advanced our understanding of the early
stages of HEV-A infections at the molecular level. However, further
experiments using clinical HEV-A isolates are necessary to clarify
the general role of PSGL-1 and SCARB2 in HEV-A infection and
their pathogenesis. Most of the prototype (laboratory-adapted)
HEV-A strains other than EV71 and CVA16 may use unidenti-
ﬁed receptor(s) to infect susceptible human cells such as RD cells.
Characterization of the identiﬁed and unidentiﬁed HEV-A recep-
tors is essential to understand the mechanism of HEV-A infection
and development of a diverse array of the clinical outcomes of
HEV-A-associated diseases.
