Actin cytoskeleton dynamics lie at the heart of cell mechanosensing signaling. in fibroblast cells, two perinuclear acto-
myosin  structures,  the  actin  cap  and  the  transmembrane  actin-associated  nuclear  (tAn)  line,  are  components  of  a 
physical pathway transducing extracellular physical signals to changes in nuclear shape and movements. We recently 
demonstrated the existence of a previously uncharacterized third apical perinuclear actin organization in epithelial cells 
that  forms  during  epithelial–mesenchymal  transition  (emt)  mediated  by  transforming  Growth  Factor-beta  (tGFβ).  A 
common regulatory mechanism for these different perinuclear actin architectures has emerged with the identification of 
a novel family of actin bundling proteins, the Refilins. here we provide updates on some characteristics of Refilin proteins, 
and we discuss potential function of the Refilins in cell mechanosensing signaling.

Introduction

Recent discoveries have established that mechanical properties of 
the cellular environment such as rigidity, geometry and external 
stresses play an important role in determining the cellular func-
tion and fate. Mechanical properties influence cell shape and ori-
entation, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and even 
govern the development and organization of tissues.1 In eukary-
otic  cells,  physical  connections  between  the  nuclear  envelope 
and the cytoskeleton provide a mechanism to transmit extracel-
lular and cytoskeletal forces to the nucleus to coordinate nuclear 
migration  and  anchorage,  organize  chromatin  and  gene  tran-
scription, and aid meiotic chromosome pairing.2-5 In fibroblasts, 
two related perinuclear actin structure anchored to the nuclear 
membrane have been characterized, the actin cap and TAN lines. 
These structures may play important role in cell mechanosensing 
and mechanotransduction, i.e., the ability of cells to sense and 
respond  to  changes  in  substrate  rigidity  and  externally  applied 
forces, respectively.6 Actin cap has been first described on fibro-
blast grown on adhesive micropatterned surfaces to control the 
overall cell shape.7,8 TAN lines were observed in NIH3T3 fibro-
blasts  migrating  into  scratch  wounds,  where  they  are  involved 
in nuclear movement and nuclear positioning.4,9 Actin caps are 
made  of  actomyosin  bundles  connected  to  the  outer  nuclear 
membrane through the LINC (linker of the nucleoskeleton and 
cytoskeleton) or SUN-KASH complex and TAN lines are a spe-
cific set of LINC complex proteins that interact with perinuclear

acto-myosin  fibers.4,7-9  To  progress  our  understanding  of  the 
functions  of  perinuclear  actin  cytoskeleton  in  mechanosens-
ing and mechanotransduction, an important step is to identify 
proteins  that  participate  in  their  organization.  In  this  context, 
we have identified a new family of short- lived actin regulatory 
proteins,  Refilins  (RefilinA  and  RefilinB),  that  organizes  peri-
nuclear actin cytoskeleton during cell differentiation switches. In 
cells, Refilins interact with the actin-binding proteins Filamins 
(FLNA, FLNB, FLNC) to exert their function.10,11 Filamins are 
a family of actin binding and scaffolding proteins that integrate 
cellular architectural and signaling parameters and are essential 
for  normal  fetal  development.12-15  Here  we  aim  to  update  the 
properties  of  Refilins  to  further  highlight  their  implications  in 
cell mechanosensing signaling.

The Refilins

Refilins  (RefilinA  and  RefilinB)  belong  to  the  FAM101  gene 
family highly conserved in mammals, xenopus and zebrafish, but 
without homologs in the genomes of Drosophila or Caenorhabditis 
elegans. In situ hybridizing studies in early mouse embryo show 
that both RefilinA (cfm2) and RefilinB (cfm1) transcript levels 
are high at the time of brain development and in peripheral tis-
sues when, concomitantly, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchy-
mal transition (EMT) are observed.16

Refilins  are  small  hydrophilic  proteins  enriched  in  proline 
with a secondary structure predicted to be composed of β sheet

and RefilinB (residues 1–112) proteins shows conserved regions with homologous (purple) or similar (blue) residues. A 15 amino-acid n-terminal 
sequence, harbouring a DSG(X)2–4S motif is fully conserved between the two proteins (blue rectangle), whereas a specific adjacent sequence is only 
found in RefilinB (red rectangle). (B) Sequence comparison of the DSG(X)2–4S motif within β-catenin, iκBα, emi1, Snail, AtF4, nFκB1/p105, Refilin and

and coiled domains lacking α helices. Such remarkable primary 
and  secondary  structures  cause  recombinant  protein  to  aggre-
gate  in bacteria, yeast, or following in vitro translation. Refilins 
are  stabilized  upon  interaction  with  their  target  protein  FLNA. 
Hence,  Refilins  can  be  purified  for  in  vitro  experiments  only 
when  complexed  with  FLNA.10  Refilins  homodimerize  through 
their N-termini. The N-termini of Refilins are also characterized 
by  a  conserved  ubiquitin-independent  PEST  degradation  signal 
(Pestfind  score:  7.8  and  10.2  for  RefilinA  and  B,  respectively) 
which overlaps with a DSG(X)2–4S motif that targets protein for 
rapid proteasome-dependant degradation (Fig. 1).17 

To our knowledge, only inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) proteins have 
both a PEST sequence and a DSG(X)2–4S motif that are responsi-
ble for the degradation of the free form and the NFκB-bound form 
of IκB, respectively.18 By treating transfected human astrocytoma 
cell line U373 MG with cycloheximide, the half-life of a recombi-
nant RefilinA-Myc fusion protein was found less than 1 h (unpub-
lished data). Remarkably, RefilinB-Myc showed a longer half-life 
than RefilinA (~7 h). We have now identified a sequence specifi-
cally present in RefilinB, contiguous to the PEST sequence (red 
rectangle in Fig. 1), that functions as an auto-inhibitory domain 
for  degradation  (unpublished  data).  Similar  regulation  has  been 
observed for unbound IκBα.18 Studies are now in progress to deter-
mine the complex pathways associated with Refilins’ stability and 
degradation.  The  relative  short  half-life  of  Refilins  suggests  that 
in physiological situations Refilins may function in dynamic actin 
cytoskeleton regulations. Accordingly, endogenous Refilins local-
ize primarily on perinuclear actin structures that transiently form 
in cells that respond to external stimulations by change in shape, 
migration and differentiation. These include rat neural progenitors 
stimulated to migrate out of neurospheres upon adhesion on poly-
l-lysine substrate for glial differentiation (unpublished data), and 

murine epithelial NMuMG cells undergoing EMT in response to 
TGFβ stimulation.10

Refilin/FLNA-Dependent Actin Bundling Promotes 
Cell-Type-Dependent Actin Cytoskeleton Phenotypes

In vitro, Refilins bind to FLNA and convert FLNA from an actin 
branching protein into one that bundles.10 Among the impressive 
number of FLNA interacting proteins so far identified,15 Refilins 
are the only ones that promote such a switch in FLNA proper-
ties. The mechanistic of this process has been studied in detail.10 
Taking into account that both Refilin and FLNA are capable of 
homodimerization,  a  model  where  Refilin  dimer  functions  as 
a  zipper  to  promote  multimolecular  FLNA  complex  to  bundle 
F-actin has been proposed.10,11

In vivo, the short half-life of Refilin makes the protein hardly 
detectable  by  conventional  immunological  tools.  Hence,  prin-
ceps studies aimed at understanding the Refilin/FLNA complex 
functions used ectopic Refilin protein expression system. Actin 
bundling  mediated  by  the  Refilin/FLNA  complex  can  convey 
very different actin cytoskeleton phenotypes depending on the 
cell  type  used  for  investigation.  A  straightforward  illustration 
is provided by comparison of Refilin-dependent phenotypes in 
human astrocytoma U373MG cell line cells and in its derivative 
clone  U373A  selected  for  its  tumorogenic  properties  by  xeno-
graft (Fig. 2). In the parental U373MG cells, ectopic expression 
of  Refilin-GFP  promotes  a  relocalization  of  FLNA  primarily 
onto basal actin stress fibers that show increased F-actin stain-
ing by phalloidin (Fig. 2A). In U373A cells, ectopic expression 
of Refilins promotes the formation of robust apical perinuclear 
parallel actin bundles forming a cap and star-shaped actin super-
structures that co-immunostain with FLNA (Fig. 2B). Formation

results clearly demonstrate that the Refilin/FLNA-mediated actin 
cytoskeleton re-organization, particularly the actin perinuclear and 
star shaped superstructures, is tightly dependent on the cell physi-
ology and probably on other signaling molecules.

Actin Cap Mediated by Refilin  
is Regulated by Cell Geometry

The dependence of the Refilin/FLNA complex on cell signaling to 
promote formation of actin perinuclear structures has gained fur-
ther support from studies in cells expressing endogenous RefilinB. 
In  mouse  NIH3T3  fibroblasts  grown  on  plastic  dishes,  endoge-
nously expressed RefilinB is stabilized when cell reach confluence. 
In RefilinB positive cells, RefilinB immunoreactivity co-localizes 
with FLNA on perinuclear actin cap.10 In NHI 3T3 cells stably 
transfected with shRNA against RefilinB, cells showed a disrupted 
actin  cap  implying  RefilinB  in  actin  cap  dynamic  regulations.10 
We confirmed a correlation between RefilinB expression and peri-
nuclear  actin  cap  formation  in  the  human  retina-derived  RPE1 
cells  grown  to  confluence  (Fig.  3).  As  previously  noticed  with 
NHI 3T3 cells, not all cells express RefilinB and only those with 
perinuclear actin cap do show significant RefilinB 
immunoreactivity.

Figure 2. Localization of the Refilin/FLnA complex in u373 mG and 
u373A cells. u373mG cells (A) and their tumorogenic u373A countepart 
(B) were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing RefilinB-
GFp. cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and immunostained with 
antibodies against FLnA from uSBiological (red). Bar = 20 µm.

In  sparsely  growing  NIH3T3  or  RPE1  cells, 
endogenous  RefilinB  concentration  is  below  the 
detection  limit  and  only  few  cell  do  show  actin 
cap. Ectopic expression of RefilinB-GFP in sparsely 
growing cells was not sufficient to promote the for-
mation of actin cap. In sparsely growing NIH3T3 
the half-live of recombinant RefilinB-GFP, assessed 
trough  cycloheximide  chase  and  protein  gel  blot 
analyses,  was  much  lower  that  in  confluente  cells 
and the protein showed diffuse cytoplasmic local-
ization or localized with FLNA on basal actin stress 
fibers  (unpublished  data).  Taken  together  these 
results indicate that RefilinB stabilization and actin 
cap  formation  are  co-regulated.  They  also  suggest  that  RefilinB 
stabilization as well as formation of the actin cap are linked to the 
cell responses to physical constraints imposed by confluence.

To confirm the dependence of actin perinuclear structure for-
mation on cell physical status, we used U373A that spontaneously 
form actin cap in response to RefilinB-GFP expression, and ana-
lyzed the presence of the actin cap depending on the substrata and 
physical constraints imposed to the cells (Fig. 4). Perinuclear actin 
organization decorated with Refilin-GFP and FLNA are clearly vis-
ible with U373A cells grown on fibronectin (Fig. 4A, left column). 
As  previously  reported  for  fibroblast  cells,  the  actin  cap  orients 
along the direction of the main axis of the cell.7 When U373A cells 
are plated onto collagen 1, cells adopt a more flattened morphol-
ogy and the actin cap does not form, although the Refilin/FLNA 
complex still decorated the basal actin stress fibers (Fig. 4A, right 
column). Moreover, when individual U373A cells were grown on 
adhesive fibronectin-coated micropatterns that prevent cells from 
adopting an elongated morphology, the Refilin/FLNA-dependent 
actin perinuclear structure did not form (Fig. 4B). In these cells,

the  Refilin/FLNA  complex  localized  onto  basal  stress  fibers,  
tension fibers and actin superstructures. These observations sug-
gest  that  actin  perinuclear  structure  formation  mediated  by  the 
Refilin/FLNA  complex  is  dependent  on  adhesion  signaling  and 
cellular geometry, and support a function for the actin cap as  a 
mediator of cellular mechanosensing and mechanotransduction.8

Refilin-dependent Actin Bundling in EMT

EMT is a biological process that allows the transformation of a 
coherent layer of epithelial cells into a group of individual and 
migrating mesenchymal cells.19,20 A number of distinct molecular 
processes  are  engaged  in  order  to  initiate  EMT.  These  include 
stabilization  of  master  transcription  factors,  such  as  Snail  and 
ATF4, which are normally degraded by the phosphorylation of 
serines  of  the  DSG(X)2–4S  motif,  which  leads  to  proteosomal 
degradation.21,22  Refilins  share  this  consensus  phosphorylation 
DSG(X)2–4S motif (Fig. 1B). Like Snail and ATF4, RefilinB pro-
tein level also specifically increases in epithelial cells stimulated

epithelial cells were cultured in the presence of tGFβ (2 ng/ml) for 12 
h. cells were then fixed with methanol and double immunostained 
with guinea pig anti RefilinB antibody (red) and mouse anti FilaminA 
antibody (green). Low (upper; Bar = 20 µm) and high (lower; Bar = 5 µm) 
magnification confocal microscopy images are shown.

Confocal  microscopy  observations  show  that,  in  polarized 
epithelial  NMuMG  cells,  TGFβ  stimulation  promotes  rapid 
concentration  of  RefilinB  protein  at  the  cell-cell  contact  sites 
at the apical surface, where it co-localizes with FLNA (Fig. 5). 
The Refilin/FLNA complex then persists on actin bundles that 
organize above the nuclei. Interestingly, during TGFβ treatment, 
basal actin stress fibers will also form but show no Refilin/FLNA 
staining.10 This suggests that the Refilin/FLNA complex contrib-
utes to re-organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton to pro-
mote the formation of the perinuclear actin bundles, and most 
likely to initiate its formation.

In  NMuMG  cells  stably  expressing  RefilinB  shRNA,  the 
perinuclear actin bundles did not form whereas basal actin stress 
fibers  re-organization  was  left  unchanged,  confirming  that  the 
RefilinB/FLNA complex functions as a specific regulator of api-
cal perinuclear actin dynamics during EMT.10 Additional stud-
ies are now required to understand the functional properties of 
this new perinuclear actin organization during EMT and to draw 
comparison with actin cap and TAN line. It is of prime interest 
to determine if the perinuclear actin network that forms in the 
initial  steps  of  EMT  is  anchored  to  the  nuclear  membrane  for 
force transduction to control nuclear movement, nuclear shape 
and/or transcription associated with EMT.

Conclusions

It is now well established that physical and mechanical cues regu-
late cell behavior, and that actin cytoskeletal tension behave as 
a  bioregulator  in  mechanotransduction.1,5  It  is  thus  likely  that 
specific actin regulatory proteins are involved in mechanosens-
ing and mechanoresponses. We have shown that Refilin form a 
novel family of actin bundling proteins whose activities depend 
on mechanical cues instructed by the substrata and by the cell 
geometry.  An  important  characteristic  of  the  proteins  is  their

with  TGFβ  suggesting  that  RefilinB  is  a  downstream  effector 
in the TGFβ pathway linked to EMT.10 It is now important to 
evaluate if TGFβ treatment regulates RefilinB stability through 
dephosphorylation of the serines of the DSG(X)2–4S motif and to 
identify the kinases responsible for its degradation in the absence 
of EMT.

It is admitted that EMT processes start with the disruption 
of  cell-cell  junctions  associated  with  the  functional  loss  of  cell 
adhesion  molecules  and  cortical  actin  cytoskeleton  reorganiza-
tion into basal stress fibers and focal adhesions.20,23 We add a level 
of complexity to this process by showing that RefilinB controls a 
novel apical actin-based network organization during early steps 
of EMT that is independent from basal stress fibers.10

to  consider  when  analyzing  Refilin-dependent  cell  phenotypes 
and  functions.  In  confluent  NIH3T3  fibroblasts  and  in  RPE1 
cells, endogenous RefilinB is stabilized when cells organize their 
actin cap suggesting that RefilinB is an actin cap-specific protein. 
The capacity of Refilin to promote actin cap has allowed for the 
first time to stimulate formation of actin caps in cells. In U373A 
cells transfected with Refilin plasmid, the ectopically expressed 
protein  localizes  with  FLNA  on  both  apical  perinuclear  actin 
cap and basal actin bundles, but only perinuclear actin cap was 
dependent on the substrata and the cell geometry (Fig. 4). These 
findings  support  a  model  where  Refilin  function  in  mechano-
sensing signaling and mechanotransduction through interaction 
with FLNA to organize/stabilize the actin cap. They open new 
perspectives toward understanding mechanisms of the actin cap 
formation, regulation and functions.

Identifying the role of Refilin/FLNA complex in organizing a 
perinuclear actin network during changes in cellular phenotype, 
such as those observed during EMT, should also have implications 
for understanding the process of intracellular mechanotransduction 
linked  with  cell  differentiation  especially  during  embryogenesis, 

when  these  regulations  are  prevalent.1,5  Dysregulation  of  peri-
nuclear actin dynamics in EMT programs could lead to develop-
mental defects or pathologies such as those observed in FLNA-null 
mouse embryos and syndromes associated with Filamin mutations. 
Loss of function of FLNA in mice or FLNA mutations in human 
are  associated  with  severe  organogenesis  defects  during  embry-
onic  development  and  adulthood.24-26  The  mechanisms  involved 
in EMT are also integrated with oncogenic pathways regulating 
tumor growth and metastasis.19,23,27 Unravelling the implication of 
the actin cap in mechanotransduction linked with the control of 
the EMT switch, could have a broad impact in understanding dys-
regulation associated with tumorogenic processes.
