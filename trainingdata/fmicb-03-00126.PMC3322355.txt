Pathogenic intracellular bacteria can respond to antimicrobial mechanisms of the host cell
through transient activation of stress-responsive genes by alternative sigma (σ) factors
of the RNA polymerase. We evaluated the contribution of the extracytoplasmic function
sigma factor Eσ for Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis resistance to stress conditions
resembling those found intracellularly during infection. A sigE-null mutant strain (ΔsigE) of
this bacterium was more susceptible in vitro to acidic pH, cell surface stressors, and bio-
logically relevant concentrations of nitric oxide (NO). The same mutant strain was unable
to persist in C57BL/6 mice but remained infective in mice lacking inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), conﬁrming the signiﬁcance of Eσ for resistance to nitric oxide/peroxide
stress in vivo. High-throughput proteomic analysis identiﬁed NO-responsive extracellular
proteins of C. pseudotuberculosis and demonstrated the participation of Eσ in composition
of this bacterium’s exoproteome.

INTRODUCTION
Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, a pathogenic bacterium
belonging to the so-called CMN-group of Actinobacteria, is the
etiological agent of various disease manifestations in different
hosts, including humans (Dorella et al., 2006; Trost et al., 2010).
The high infectious potential of C. pseudotuberculosis is depen-
dent on its ability to resist diverse stressful conditions, both as a
free-living organism and within the host. Previous reports have
suggested that this bacterium can survive in the environment for
several months before infecting an animal (Baird and Fontaine,
2007). Once inside the host, C. pseudotuberculosis survives phago-
cytosis to remain as an intracellular parasite within phagocytic cells
(Stefa ´nska et al., 2010). This is achieved by overcoming the innate
antimicrobial defense mechanisms of the host cells. These cells cre-
ate a harsh environment inside the phagolysosome by generating
reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, via phagocyte oxidase
(Phox) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), respectively
(Nathan and Shiloh, 2000).

Bacteria can respond to different environmental stimuli
through switching of the primary sigma (σ) factor subunit that
is associated with core RNA polymerase by alternative σ factors.
This confers novel promoter-recognition speciﬁcities to the poly-
merase and provides a mechanism for rapid regulation of different
sets of stress-responsive genes (Staron et al., 2009). Proteins of the
extracytoplasmic function (ECF) family of alternative σ factors,

such as σE, mostly regulate response to cell surface-stresses and
have already been shown to control virulence-associated genes in
different pathogenic bacteria (Helmann, 2002; Kazmierczak et al.,
2005).

Previous studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis transcriptional
responses to the stress conditions found within phagocytic cells
have suggested the involvement of the ECF sigma factor σE in bac-
terial intracellular survival (Ohno et al., 2003; Schnappinger et al.,
2003; Talaat et al., 2004; Fontán et al., 2008). Moreover, sigE has
recently been shown to be part of a small set of M. tuberculosis
genes that are selectively up-regulated in response to nitrosative
stress (Voskuil et al., 2011).

In this study with C. pseudotuberculosis, we show that σE is
indeed required for resistance to in vitro-generated, biologically
relevant concentrations of nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, we also
demonstrate that this regulatory protein plays a role in resis-
tance to combined NO/peroxide stress faced by bacteria during
infection.

strains were maintained in Luria–Bertani medium and employed
in DNA manipulation experiments, according to standard proto-
cols. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were used
where appropriate.

A chemically deﬁned medium (CDM), previously optimized
for growth of C. pseudotuberculosis (Moura-Costa et al., 2002),
was used in all the experiments that included stress-generating
agents. The composition of the CDM was as follows: auto-

KH2PO4 (2.55 g/l), NH4Cl (1 g/l), MgSO4·7H2O (0.20 g/l), CaCl2

CONSTRUCTION OF A sigE-NULL MUTANT STRAIN OF C.
PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS
A conserved region of the sigE gene of C. pseudotuberculo-
sis (GenBank: ADL20681.1) was initially isolated by a strat-
egy employing degenerate primers. Basically, the amino acid
sequences of
tuberculosis
(Rv1221), C. diphtheria (DIP0994), C. glutamicum (NCgl1075),
and C. efﬁciens (CE1177) were retrieved from public databases
and aligned using the ClustalW tool. Highly conserved regions
were identiﬁed in the σE factors of these bacteria and degen-
erate primers were designed according to the coding sequences
of these factors, such that it would be possible to amplify
a partial region of the sigE gene in all genomes analyzed.
The primer pair sigE#1: GGMACCGCAGCDTTCGACGC and
sigE#2: CGTCCRCGGTGRATWCGGGA was used for ampliﬁca-
tion of an expected 490 bp internal fragment of the sigE gene
of C. pseudotuberculosis. PCR products around the expected
size were puriﬁed from agarose gels,
ligated into the vector
pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen), and sequenced according to standard
protocols.

A plasmid carrying a fragment of the sigE gene was intro-
duced into the wild-type strain 1002 of C. pseudotuberculosis by
electroporation. This plasmid functions as a suicide vector for
this bacterium, as it does not carry a functional corynebacter-
ial replication origin. C. pseudotuberculosis clones that underwent
recombination were selected by kanamycin resistance (25 μg/ml).
Conﬁrmation of recombination events in the C. pseudotuberculosis
genome was obtained by Southern blot analysis using a [α32-
P]dCTP radiolabeled probe for the sigE gene, or through PCR reac-
tions employing different combinations of primers that align in
the start and stop codons of sigE with primers that align within the
inserted plasmid: sigE#3-ATGACATCGAACAGTGGTTC/sigE#4-
TTAGTGGGACATCGGTAGG; Kan#1-ATGATTGAACAAGATGG
ATTG/Kan#2-TTAATAATTCAGAAGAACTC; M13F/M13R (Invit-
rogen; data not shown).

IN VITRO RESISTANCE TO STRESS-GENERATING AGENTS
Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis strains were grown in CDM

to early exponential phase (OD540nm = ∼0.1), cultures were

split into several aliquots and then incubated separately with

different concentrations of various stress-generating agents,
as follows: osmotic stress (NaCl, 0.5 and 1 M); acidic stress
(HCl, to pH 4.5 and 5.5); detergent stress (SDS, 0.01% w/v
lysozyme, 500 and 750 μg/ml; alcoholic stress
and 0.05%);
(ethanol, 2.5 and 5%); oxidative stress (H2O2, 1, 10, and
50 mM); nitric oxide stress (DETA/NO – diethylenetriamine
NON-Oate, 0.1 and 1 mM). For starvation stress, CDM was
prepared with low concentrations of glucose: 0.3 and 0.15%.
For heat and cold shocks, cultures were incubated at 50
or 4˚C for 30 min, and then returned to normal growth
at 37˚C.

Growth of the control and stressed cultures of C. pseudotu-
berculosis, of both wild-type (1002) and mutant (ΔsigE) strains,
was monitored for 24 h in a LabSystems iEMS Absorbance Plate
Reader (Thermo Fisher), at OD540nm. Results were plotted using
the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc); the inte-
grals of the areas under the curves (AUC) were determined,
and a growth index (GI) was then calculated, as follows: GI

(%)= [(AUCTreated culture/AUCControl culture)× 100]. Experiments

were performed at least in triplicate.

NITRIC OXIDE DETECTION
Steady-state concentrations of NO generated by the NO-donor
DETA/NO in the cell culture medium were determined ampero-
metrically using an NO-speciﬁc electrode (ISO-NOP, World Pre-
cision Instruments, Inc.) attached to an NO meter (ISO-NO Mark
II, WPI). Brieﬂy, the electrode was immersed in CDM and the
electrode current allowed to stabilize under conditions identical
to those used in the cell culture experiments before addition of
different concentrations of DETA/NO and recording of the elec-
trode response. Stock solutions of DETA/NO (Sigma-Aldrich)
were prepared fresh and kept on ice in the dark, as described
(Feelisch, 1998). Currents in pA were converted into NO concen-
trations by comparison to a standard calibration curve generated
from either copper(I)-mediated decomposition of S-nitroso-N -
acetyl-d,l-penicillamine or from iodide-mediated nitrite reduc-
tion, under otherwise identical conditions (Davies and Zhang,
2008).

ate macrophage viability following C. pseudotuberculosis infection
(MOI 5:1), as described (McKean et al., 2007).

EXTRACTION OF C. PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS EXTRACELLULAR
PROTEINS FOLLOWING NO-TREATMENT AND COMPARATIVE
EXOPROTEOME PROFILING
The 1002 (wt) and ΔsigE strains of C. pseudotuberculosis were
grown in CDM to mid-exponential phase, cultures were split
into two aliquots and 100 μM of the NO-donor DETA/NO were
added to one aliquot of each strain. NO-treated cultures along
with control cultures were further incubated for 1 h at 37˚C.
At this point, extracellular proteins were extracted by the three-
phase partitioning technique and identiﬁed/quantiﬁed by a high-
throughput proteomic strategy, based on a recently introduced
method of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry acquisition
(LC–MSE), exactly as previously described (Pacheco et al., 2011).
Biological function annotations for the identiﬁed proteins were
retrieved from the gene ontology (GO) database, using the web
tool AmiGO1 (Carbon et al., 2009). Protein regulation data were
obtained from the CoryneRegNet v6.0 Database2 (Pauling et al.,
2011).

RESULTS
A sigE-NULL MUTANT STRAIN OF C. PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS IS MORE
SENSITIVE TO CELL SURFACE STRESSORS, ACIDIC PH, AND
IN VITRO-GENERATED NITRIC OXIDE
In order to evaluate the role played by the ECF sigma factor
σE in C. pseudotuberculosis resistance to stress conditions faced
during intracellular infection, a sigE-null mutant strain of this
bacterium (ΔsigE) was generated by homologous recombination
in the parental strain 1002 (wt). Both strains were submitted to a
series of stress-generating agents in vitro, which aimed at mimic-
king conditions found by bacterial pathogens in the intraphago-
somal environment (Rohde et al., 2007; Ehrt and Schnappinger,
2009; Schaible, 2009).

Mutation of sigE in C. pseudotuberculosis did not alter cell
growth and morphology under normal conditions (Figure 1).

Growth of the ΔsigE strain was also comparable to the 1002
(wt) strain under conditions of nutrient starvation (limiting glu-
cose), and under osmotic, thermal, alcoholic, and oxidative stresses
(Figure 1). On the other hand, the mutant strain was more sensi-
tive to an acidic pH that resembles that found within an activated
macrophage (pH= 5.5), and to cell surface stressors, namely SDS
and lysozyme treatments (Figure 1), corroborating previous stud-
ies on the role of σE in resistance to environmental-stresses in
other corynebacteria and mycobacteria (Manganelli et al., 2001;
Park et al., 2008). Interestingly, growth of the ΔsigE strain was
also more affected than that of the wt strain following exposure to
different concentrations of the NO-donor DETA/NO (Figures 1
and 2A). NO electrode measurements indicated that the con-
centrations of the NO-donor used in our experiments, 0.1 and
1 mM, resulted in steady-state NO concentrations of ∼500 nM
and 5 μM, respectively. The effect of these concentrations on
growth of the two C. pseudotuberculosis strains was apparently
more due to a bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal action of NO
(Figure 2C), as reported for other bacterial pathogens (Ogawa
et al., 2001; Voskuil et al., 2011). Notably, the ΔsigE strain was
much more sensitive to the combination of the NO-donor and
H2O2 (Figures 1 and 2B), reinforcing the requirement of σE
for C. pseudotuberculosis resistance to combined NO/peroxide
stress.

σE IS REQUIRED FOR C. PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS RESISTANCE TO
NO-STRESS DURING INFECTION
The participation of σE in C. pseudotuberculosis resistance to
the conditions found within the host was ﬁrst evaluated by
infection of C57BL/6 mice with the wt and mutant strains of
this bacterium, followed by analysis of bacterial persistence in
mouse spleens. After 3 days of infection, the ΔsigE strain of
C. pseudotuberculosis was virtually undetectable in the spleens
of C57BL/6 mice, whereas the 1002 (wt) strain still persisted
(Figure 3A). We then evaluated whether nitrosative stress was
a determining condition for the lowered persistence of
the
ΔsigE mutant in the host. For this, we infected C57BL/6 or

duce NO in the intraphagosomal environment, and compared
bacterial loads in mouse spleens 3 days post-infection. Again,
the C. pseudotuberculosis strain lacking σE was unable to per-
sist in C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Figure 3B); nevertheless, the
ΔsigE mutant displayed a surprisingly high ability to survive
animals, following an initial 106 CFU inoculum
in the iNOS
(Figure 3B).

Wild-type C. pseudotuberculosis has been shown to possess a
profound capability to kill macrophages in culture (Stefa ´nska et al.,
2010), but this natural ability is also affected in the ΔsigE strain
(Figure 3C). However, only ca. 30% of iNOS
macrophages
survived after 4 h infection with this mutant (Figure 3C). This cor-
roborated the importance of σE in C. pseudotuberculosis resistance
to NO generated intracellularly.

ALTERATIONS OF THE C. PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS EXOPROTEOME IN
RESPONSE TO NO-STRESS
The extracellular proteomes of the 1002 (wt) and ΔsigE strains
of C. pseudotuberculosis were proﬁled by a high-throughput

proteomics method (LC–MSE), before and after treatment by
100 μM of the NO-donor DETA/NO.

In total, 281 extracellular proteins were conﬁdentially identi-
ﬁed by this strategy, in the four groups studied: (i) 1002 (wt)
untreated; (ii) 1002 (wt)+ DETA/NO; (iii) ΔsigE untreated; (iv)
ΔsigE + DETA/NO. This represented 104 different extracellular
proteins of C. pseudotuberculosis (Figure 4A). Proteins exported
after NO-treatment could be detected in both 1002 (wt) and ΔsigE
strains (Figure 4A). The mutant strain exported a higher number
of proteins in comparison to the wt strain, under normal growth
conditions, and after NO-stress (Figure 4A). The majority (67%)
of these differential proteins of the ΔsigE strain are predicted in sil-
ico to be truly exported proteins (data not shown). Moreover, the
proteins commonly identiﬁed in the four groups presented very
similar concentrations in all samples (Figure 4B) showing a high
reproducibility of the methods used for extraction and identiﬁ-
cation of the exoproteins. This demonstrates that the qualitative
differences observed between the exoproteomes are in fact due to
biological variations of the extracellular proteomes.

Three proteins were commonly identiﬁed in the 1002 (wt) and
ΔsigE strains exclusively after treatment by NO (Figure 4A). Only

were again highly represented predicted biological functions in
this protein set (Table 1). Some of these proteins have already
been seen to participate in C. pseudotuberculosis responses to other
environmental stress conditions, according to the CoryneRegNet
Database (Table 1).

A few proteins primarily considered to have a cytoplasmic loca-
tion have been identiﬁed following NO-stress (Table 1). These
included the chaperonin GroEL, which was found in the exopro-
teomes of both wt and ΔsigE strains of C. pseudotuberculosis,
and the proteins glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) and dnaK, differentially exported only in the mutant
strain (Table 1). These cytoplasmic proteins have been consistently
identiﬁed in recent exoproteome studies of various bacteria (Sen-
gupta et al., 2010; Dreisbach et al., 2011). Besides, environmental
cues such as osmotic stress and host contact have been shown
to induce exportation of some of these proteins (Chitlaru et al.,
2007; Mattinen et al., 2007; Pumirat et al., 2009). However, the
molecular mechanisms that account for non-classical (leaderless)
secretion of speciﬁc cytoplasmic proteins is still to be completely
understood (Pasztor et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011). Moonlighting
roles have already been demonstrated for these proteins while in
the extracellular environment, including adhesion to host cells and
evasion of host’s immune mechanisms (Matta et al., 2010; Jin et al.,
2011).

Noticeably, while most of the proteins commonly identiﬁed
between the exoproteomes of the NO-treated strains presented
very similar concentrations (Figure 4B), a single protein anno-
tated as a “putative secreted protein” (ADL21925.1) was highly
secreted only in the ΔsigE strain. This protein has also been shown
to be differentially regulated during osmotic stress, according to
CoryneRegNet.

DISCUSSION
Pathogenic bacteria that reside within phagocytic cells face
nitrosative stress due to the action of iNOS, which delivers NO
to the intraphagosomal compartment (Nathan and Shiloh, 2000;
Ehrt and Schnappinger, 2009). NO is a highly reactive radical
which in high concentrations can lead to metabolic arrest and
damage of cellular components, including membranes and DNA,
thus inhibiting bacterial growth (Ogawa et al., 2001). Through
combination with reactive oxygen species, considerably more reac-
tive antimicrobial agents can be generated, such as peroxynitrite
(ONOO
; Ehrt and Schnappinger, 2009). To survive such stress-
ful conditions found in the intracellular environment, bacteria
need to be able to rapidly respond to environmental cues through
global changes in gene expression; this role is played by alterna-
tive sigma factors of the bacterial RNA polymerase (Helmann,
2002).

Previous studies with M. tuberculosis have consistently shown
that the gene coding for the extracytoplasmic function sigma
factor σE is up-regulated during intracellular infection (Ohno
et al., 2003; Schnappinger et al., 2003; Talaat et al., 2004; Fontán
et al., 2008). More recently, the sigE gene was shown to par-
ticipate in a speciﬁc transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis
following NO-treatment in vitro (Voskuil et al., 2011). Taken
together, these studies strongly suggest that σE may be neces-
sary for M. tuberculosis to cope with reactive nitrogen species

within the host cell, but this possibility has not been speciﬁcally
investigated yet.

In this study, we show that σE is indeed required for full resis-
tance to nitrosative stress in the intracellular actinobacterium
C. pseudotuberculosis. Biologically relevant concentrations of NO,
generated here by the NO-donor DETA/NO, importantly affected
growth of this bacterium, similarly to what has been reported for
M. tuberculosis (Voskuil et al., 2003, 2011). Growth impairment
was much more pronounced in a sigE-null mutant strain of C.
pseudotuberculosis, following exposure to both low and high con-
centrations of NO (Figure 1). The fact that the strain lacking
σE displayed lowered persistence in mice following experimental
infection (Figure 3A) raises the possibility that impaired growth
in the host might be due, at least in part, to the inability of
this strain to resist NO-stress during infection. This notion was
conﬁrmed by our experiments in mice unable to mount an intra-
cellular NO response during infection (iNOS knockout mice). In
these animals, the ΔsigE strain of C. pseudotuberculosis persists
much longer than in wild-type mice (Figure 3B); this demon-
strated that σE is in fact necessary for resistance to nitrosative
stress in vivo. Moreover, the signiﬁcant effect of this mutant on
macrophages in culture (Figure 3C), which
viability of iNOS
is expected to be related to the ability of the bacteria to repli-
cate in the intraphagosomal compartment, further corroborates
the involvement of σE in bacterial survival to reactive nitrogen
species.

Since the ECF sigma factor σE seems to participate in
response to cell envelope stresses in different bacteria, we hypoth-
esized that mutation of its coding gene in C. pseudotubercu-
losis could lead to alterations of this bacterium’s extracellular
proteome in response to NO-stress. In fact, we could iden-
tify differentially regulated exoproteins of C. pseudotuberculosis

following NO-treatment. Besides, marked differences were
observed between the exoproteomes of the 1002 (wt) and ΔsigE
strains (Figure 4).

Exportation of proteins involved in metal ion acquisition and
redox homeostasis seems to be a primary response of C. pseudotu-
berculosis to biologically relevant concentrations of NO (Table 1).
Recent studies on the transcriptional alterations in M. tubercu-
losis and M. bovis BCG following treatment by NO or H2O2
also demonstrated that these bacteria up-regulate iron acquisition
genes as a speciﬁc response to nitrosative and oxidative stresses
(Jang et al., 2009; Voskuil et al., 2011). Additional proteins found
to be exported in the ΔsigE mutant strain of C. pseudotubercu-
losis in response to NO, compared to the 1002 (wt) strain, might
be indicative of a compensatory, more general response to stress
(Table 1). This is reinforced by the fact that some of these pro-
teins have already been shown to be part of other stimulons in
C. pseudotuberculosis, regulated by heat shock, osmotic, or acidic
stresses (Table 1).

In conclusion, our results demonstrate a role for the ECF sigma
factor σE in resistance of an intracellular bacterium to nitrosative
stress. While deletion of this sigma factor in C. pseudotuberculosis
did contribute for altering the composition of this bacterium’s
exoproteome in response to environmental cues, further stud-
ies remain necessary to better deﬁne SigE-responsive genes that
account for the observed nitric oxide-susceptible phenotype of
the ΔsigE strain.
