Extensive mats of Fe oxyhydroxides and associated Fe-oxidizing microbial organisms form
in diverse geochemical settings – freshwater seeps to deep-sea vents – where ever oppos-
ing Fe(II)-oxygen gradients prevail.The mineralogy, reactivity, and structural transformations
of Fe oxyhydroxides precipitated from submarine hydrothermal ﬂuids within microbial mats
remains elusive in active and fossil systems. In response, a study of Fe microbial mat
formation at the Loihi Seamount was conducted to describe the physical and chemical
characteristics of Fe-phases using extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure spectroscopy,
powder X-ray diffraction, synchrotron radiation X-ray total scattering, low-temperature mag-
netic measurements, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Particle sizes of 3.5–4.6 nm were
estimated from magnetism data, and coherent scattering domain (CSD) sizes as small as
1.6 nm are indicated by pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Disorder in the nanostruc-
tured Fe-bearing phases results in limited intermediate-range structural order: less than that
of standard two-line ferrihydrite (Fh), except for the Pohaku site. The short-range ordered
natural Fh (FhSRO) phases were stable at 4˚C in the presence of oxygen for at least 1 year
and during 400˚C treatment.The observed stability of the FhSRO is consistent with magnetic
observations that point to non-interacting nanoparticles. PDF analyses of total scattering
data provide further evidence for FhSRO particles with a poorly ordered silica coating. The
presence of coated particles explains the small CSD for the mat minerals, as well as the
stability of the minerals over time and against heating. The mineral properties observed
here provide a starting point from which progressively older and more extensively altered
Fe deposits may be examined, with the ultimate goal of improved interpretation of past
biogeochemical conditions and diagenetic processes.

INTRODUCTION
Iron (Fe) microbial mats form in opposing iron and oxygen gra-
dients in a wide variety of settings (Emerson and Revsbech, 1994;
Chan et al., 2004; Rentz et al., 2007; Druschel et al., 2008; Edwards
et al., 2011). The physical and chemical properties of the Fe-
bearing phases will determine the biogeochemical reactivity of
the minerals within the mats (Ekstrom et al., 2010; Boland et al.,
2011; Hansel et al., 2011). Yet the crystallinity, local Fe coordi-
nation environment, and available reactive sites of the minerals
are difﬁcult to measure, and the structure or continuum of struc-
tures that compose one of the most common Fe oxyhydroxides,
ferrihydrite (Fh), is an active topic of research and scientiﬁc con-
troversy today (Michel et al., 2007a, 2010; Penn, 2007; Manceau,
2009, 2011; Pinney et al., 2009; Maillot et al., 2011), as it has
been for more than two decades (Campbell, 1991; Drits et al.,
1993; Manceau and Drits, 1993; Waychunas et al., 1996; Jam-
bor and Dutrizac, 1998; Janney et al., 2000; Schwertmann et al.,
2004). Poorly crystalline iron oxyhydroxides are often difﬁcult to

characterize due to nanometer particle dimensions (Michel et al.,
2007a; Hochella Jr. et al., 2008) and a large number of polymorphs
(Navrotsky et al., 2008). In addition, structural and compositional
variability and complexity is intrinsic to Fe oxyhydroxides formed
in settings such as microbial bioﬁlms (Edwards et al., 2003; Chan
et al., 2004; Toner et al., 2009) or in the presence of strongly sorbing
inorganic and organic ligands (Cornell and Schwertmann, 1979;
Waychunas et al., 1996; Rose et al., 1997; Vilge-Ritter et al., 1999;
Doelsch et al., 2003; Mikutta, 2011). Considering that the gold
standard measurement for mineralogy – powder X-ray diffraction
(XSD) – relies on long-range structural order, it is not surprising
that Fe mineralogy of microbial mats, often formed in the pres-
ence of abundant inorganic ligands and microbial cell surfaces
and exudates, remains elusive. One viable strategy for describing
Fe microbial mat mineralogy is to measure a suite of funda-
mental properties: (1) short-range structural order and valence
state; (2) degree of structural defects relative to standard syn-
thetic minerals; (3) degree of particle interaction and aggregation;

(4) distribution of particle dimensions and extent of structural
coherence; and (5) stability and recrystallization as a function of
time and temperature.

In this context, the mineralogy of Loihi Seamount Fe microbial
mats was examined as a function of temperature, water depth, and
bulk aqueous geochemistry. Loihi Seamount is a seismically active
submarine volcano and emerging Hawaiian Island (Klein, 1982;
DeCarlo et al., 1983). Hydrothermal venting at Loihi produces
opposing Fe and oxygen gradients (Glazer and Rouxel, 2009) and
supports abundant microbial life including Fe-oxidizing bacteria
(Emerson and Moyer, 2002). Iron mat formation at Loihi is per-
vasive, occurring at a range of temperatures (0–60˚C), in diverse
settings (ultra-diffuse regional venting at 5000 m to focused vent-
ing as shallow as 1116 m), and microbial activity in the mats has
been demonstrated (Moyer et al., 1994, 1995; Emerson and Moyer,
2002; Edwards et al., 2011). Filamentous, non-ﬁlamentous, tubu-
lar, and branching microbial structures in the mats that form near
venting are encrusted with Fe minerals, and biological Fe oxidation
contributes approximately 60% of total Fe oxidation (Karl et al.,
1988, 1989; Emerson and Moyer, 2002). Vent ﬂuids near the sum-
mit of Loihi are enriched in carbon dioxide, ammonium, silicon
(Si), Fe, and manganese (Mn) (Sedwick et al., 1992; Wheat et al.,
2000). The goal of this research is to describe the physical and
chemical properties of the minerals formed in Loihi Fe microbial
mats. To accomplish this, we used synchrotron radiation X-ray
absorption spectroscopy, X-ray ﬂuorescence microspectroscopy,
and X-ray total scattering, as well as Mössbauer spectroscopy and
low-temperature magnetic measurements to identify the factors
contributing to mat mineralogy. We also examine whether bio-
geochemical factors that control mineral formation inﬂuence only
the initial precipitation of Fe oxyhydroxides or their long-term
properties and preservation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
LOIHI MAT COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Iron microbial mats at the Loihi Seamount were collected during
research cruises in 2006 (R/V Melville), 2007 (R/V Kilo Moana),

and 2008 (R/V Thompson) as part of a National Science Founda-
tion Fe Microbial Observatory (FeMO) project. General charac-
teristics of each site are summarized in Table 1. Sites represent the
range of naturally occurring characteristics of the vents that occur
at Loihi.

The remotely operated vehicle JASON2 was used to collect mats
with scoops and suction samplers. Typically the samples collected
by slurp suction sampling experience a vigorous mixing of a large
volume (several liters) of mat material, whereas consolidated mats
collected in polycarbonate scoops retain some of their structural
cohesiveness. Once shipboard, the loosely aggregated, well-mixed
mat “ﬂocs” were sub-sampled into 15 mL sterile tubes and either:
(1) stored at 4˚C and referred to as “fresh” or “aged” mat samples;
or (2) frozen at −20˚C and referred to as “frozen” mat samples.
In the laboratory, a subset of these ﬂocculent mat samples were
defrosted, rinsed with puriﬁed water to remove sea salts, and dried
at 40˚C: these samples are referred to as (3) “dry” mat samples.
At the deepest, very low-temperature diffuse venting site Ula Nui,
approximately the top 5–10 cm of layered Fe–Mn microbial mats
were collected in scoop-samplers and were stored fresh and frozen
as fully (4) “intact” map samples. All of the mat samples exam-
ined for this study are reported in Table 1. The term “fresh” mat
is applied to samples that were stored at 4˚C and analyzed within
1 month of seaﬂoor recovery. The term “aged” mat is applied to
samples stored at 4˚C and analyzed after 0.5 to greater than 1 year
after seaﬂoor recovery.

X-RAY ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY
Iron K-edge X-ray absorption microspectroscopy
X-ray microprobe measurements were performed for three types
of Loihi mat samples: (a) intact surface crust from Ula Nui; (b)
fresh mat ﬂocs; and (c) 4˚C aged mat ﬂocs.

One intact surface crust of an Fe–Mn layered mat from Ula
Nui was prepared for X-ray microprobe element mapping by slic-
ing a 3-mm thick by 8 cm wide by 4 cm tall section of a sample
frozen at −20˚C. The slice was then positioned into an anaero-
bic aluminum sample holder with thin mylar windows that was

Mineralogy of iron microbial mats

continuously purged with helium at room temperature. Three
different regions of the slice were then mapped – “R1,” a 200-
μm× 200-μm region at the very top surface of the mat, “R2,”
a 1600-μm× 200-μm region located 400 μm below the surface
of the mat, and then “R3,” a ﬁnal 200 μm× 200 μm region in
the middle of the mat. Each map area was sequentially raster
scanned at three energies across the Mn K-edge (6545, 6550, and
6560 eV) and then three energies across the Fe K-edge (7120,
7126, and 7133 eV) at BL 2-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia-
tion Lightsource using a Si 220 phi= 0 monochromator detuned
30% and a focused spot size of 2 μm× 2 μm. Full X-ray ﬂu-
orescence spectra were collected for each pixel with a 100-ms
dwell time using a three-element germanium detector. A matrix
of predicted Fe(II) versus Fe(III) and Mn(II) versus Mn(IV) ﬂu-
orescence yields at each incident energy was generated from the
Fe X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of a
reduced basalt glass [88% Fe(II)] versus the 100% Fe(III)-oxide
standard, and the Mn XANES spectra of Mn2+
(aq) [100% Mn(II)]
and δ-MnO2 [100% Mn(IV)] standards (e.g., Templeton et al.,
2009). The resulting I 0-normalized, dead time-corrected element
distribution, and oxidation–reduction maps were generated using
Microanalysis Toolkit (Webb, 2006). Iron and Mn K-edge XANES
spectra were also collected from speciﬁc spots in each map and
analyzed using SixPack to conﬁrm the oxidation states of Fe and
Mn by comparison to our model compound library.

X-ray microprobe measurements were also conducted among a
random assortment of disseminated mat particle aggregates (ﬂocs)
to determine Fe speciation. These fresh and aged Loihi mat ﬂocs
(Lohiau, Pohaku, Naha, and Ula Nui) were deposited on polycar-
bonate membranes (0.2 μm pore size) and rinsed with puriﬁed
water using a glass ﬁltration tower (MilliPore) and hand vacuum
pump. Mat samples were analyzed at room temperature on the
membrane with no further processing using a published method
(Toner et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, microprobe Fe extended X-ray absorp-
tion ﬁne structure (EXAFS) spectra were collected at the Advanced
Light Source on beamline 10.3.2 with a seven-element germanium
detector in ﬂuorescence mode (Marcus et al., 2004). The mono-
chromator energy calibration was set with Fe foil at 7110.75 eV.
The spectra were collected to a reciprocal space (k) value of 14.4
−1) whenever possible. Individual scans collected at the same
(Å
sample location were examined for changes in line-shape and peak
position, and no photon-induced sample damage was observed.
Spectra were dead time-corrected, energy calibrated, and averaged
using custom beamline software (Marcus et al., 2004) and con-
verted to k-space using SixPack (Webb, 2005). No over-absorption
corrections were applied to EXAFS data.

Bulk iron K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Bulk Fe EXAFS spectra were collected for two types of Loihi mats:
(1) frozen samples stored and analyzed under inert gas; and (2)
“dry” samples that were frozen shipboard, and defrosted, rinsed,
dried, and analyzed in ambient atmosphere.

Synchrotron-based Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra for two bulk
mat ﬂocs (Spillway and Hiolo mats) were collected from 7000
to 8000 eV on beamline 11-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia-
tion Lightsource using a Si(220) phi= 0 monochromator crystal
detuned 30% for harmonic rejection, and a Lytle detector for

ﬂuorescence measurements. All data reduction including aver-
aging, dead time correction, and post-edge normalization was
conducted using SixPack to generate background-subtracted, k3-
weighted EXAFS spectra. Spectra were calibrated using the ﬁrst
inﬂection of a Fe0 foil at 7112 eV. These three mat samples were
analyzed in a hydrated state after being thawed and loaded into
a 2-mm× 20-mm slit in a 1-mm mylar holder sealed with kap-
ton tape in an anaerobic chamber. The mylar sample holder was
maintained under anaerobic conditions on BL 11-2 by continu-
ously ﬂushing nitrogen through a specialized sample box attached
to the ﬂuorescence detector.

Several dry Loihi mat samples (Ula Nui-A, Ula Nui-B, Lohiau
A, Spillway A, and BT37) were applied to double-sided adhesive
in thin layers. Mat samples were analyzed at room temperature
with no further processing. Bulk Fe EXAFS were collected at
the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 20-BM in transmis-
sion mode. The monochromator energy was set with Fe foil at
7110.75 eV. The spectra were collected to a reciprocal space (k)
−1). Individual scans were examined for
value of greater than 15 (Å
changes in line-shape and peak position, and no photon-induced
sample damage was observed. Spectra were dead time-corrected,
energy calibrated, averaged, and converted to k-space using Athena
(Ravel and Newville, 2005). The spectra were compared to ref-
erence Fe oxyhydroxides (goethite and two-line Fh) synthesized
using published methods (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003), and
sample preparation and data collection were identical to that
described for the dry Loihi mat samples.

Reference Fe EXAFS spectra for this data set include goethite,
six-line Fh, two-line Fh, lepidocrocite, hematite, siderite, green
rust sulfate, jarosite, marcasite, magnetite, vivianite, and Fe(III)–
phosphate (Hansel et al., 2003), as well as Fe-smectite (O’Day
et al., 2004), additional Fe-silicates such as basalt, olivine, pyroxene,
chlorite, Fe-bearing serpentine and talc group minerals (Mayhew
et al., 2011), and a biogenic Fe oxyhydroxide formed during a
seaﬂoor sulﬁde incubation study (Toner et al., 2009).

SYNCHROTRON RADIATION X-RAY DIFFRACTION AND TOTAL
SCATTERING
High-energy X-ray total scattering experiments were conducted
at beamline 11-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne
National Laboratory. Selected dry mat samples (Ula Nui-A/B,
Lohiau A, Spillway A, and BT37) were packed into ∼1 mm O.D.
polyimide (Kapton) capillaries and the scattered intensity from the
samples was collected at ambient temperature with an amorphous-
silicon-based ﬂat-panel detector system (Perkin Elmer) mounted
orthogonal to the incident beam path. For synchrotron radia-
tion X-ray diffraction (XRD; SR-XRD) measurements the X-ray
energy was ﬁxed at ∼58 keV (λ= 0.2128 Å) and the sample-to-
detector distance was optimized to cover d-spacings ranging from
∼0.5 to 8.5 Å. For pair distribution function (PDF) experiments
the X-ray energy was ﬁxed at ∼90.5 keV (λ= 0.13702 Å) and a
sample-to-detector distance of ∼21.5 cm was chosen. This exper-
imental geometry yielded scattering data with a maximum usable
−1 (where Q = 4πsinθ·λ−1 is the magnitude of
Q-range of 30 Å
the scattering vector or momentum transfer). The total expo-
sure time for the blank (i.e., empty capillary) was 3200 s and
each sample was 1200 s. Fit2D (Hammersley et al., 1996) was

used to convert two-dimensional data to one-dimensional inten-
sity versus scattering angle (2θ). The experimental total scattering
structure function S(Q), reduced structure function f(Q), and PDF
were obtained using PDFgetX2 (Qiu et al., 2004). The data were
corrected for parasitic background scattering and inelastic con-
tributions (e.g., Compton scattering) as well as those corrections
unique to image-plate geometry (Chupas et al., 2003). A Lorch
modiﬁcation function (Lorch, 1969) was applied.

The PDF, or G(r), is the Fourier transform of the reduced struc-
ture function and has been described in detail elsewhere (Guinier,
1963; Egami and Billinge, 2003). In general, peaks in the PDF occur
at characteristic distances separating pairs of atoms, and thus the
PDF is an averaged representation of structure. As discussed below,
additional information such as the scattering domain size can be
extracted from the attenuation in peak intensities with increasing
r (see Gilbert, 2008 for review). In this study, the maximum coher-
ent scattering domain (CSD) size for the samples and references
is estimated from the PDFs and is reported with an error of ±3 Å
(Hall et al., 2000). Structural information was extracted directly
from the experimental PDFs by ﬁtting the features with Gauss-
ian functions (PeakFit v4.12). At shorter length scales (<∼2.5 Å)
the peak positions yield actual average bond lengths (e.g., Si-O,
Fe-O). At longer length scales the PDF becomes more compli-
cated because peaks from different origins overlap. As such, the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian functions
were varied together in order to minimize the number of free
parameters. In addition, the positions of peaks at 3.03 and 3.44 Å
(representing edge- and corner-sharing Fe polyhedra, respectively,
as described below) were ﬁxed during ﬁtting of the natural samples
in order to further constrain the number of degrees of free-
dom. As discussed below, the presence of at least edge-sharing
Fe polyhedra is further justiﬁed by the EXAFS results for these
samples.

Synthetic two-line Fh and amorphous silica were used as ref-
erences. Ferrihydrite was precipitated at room temperature by the
rapid hydrolysis of 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 to pH 7 with 2 M NaOH.
Amorphous SiO2 (am-SiO2) was precipitated by hydrolysis of
tetraethyl orthosilicate [Si(OC2H5)4 (Fisher Scientiﬁc)] with 12 M
HCl according to the procedure described by Hirata et al. (2003).

MAGNETISM
A commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-XL-Quantum
Design) was used to measure induced magnetization curves [zero
ﬁeld cooling (ZFC) and ﬁeld cooling (FC)], hysteresis loops,
room temperature saturation isothermal remanent magnetization
(RTSIRM), and AC susceptibility as a function of temperature,
and frequency (Institute for Rock Magnetism, University of Min-
nesota). ZFC induced magnetization curves were obtained by
cooling the samples in zero ﬁeld from 300 to 2 K, then the magne-
tization was recorded as temperature increases in a small applied
ﬁeld (B = 5 mT). For ﬁeld cooled induced magnetization curves,
the sample is cooled to 2 K in a 5-mT applied ﬁeld, and magneti-
zation is measured as temperature increases. Hysteresis loops were
obtained by using maximum applied ﬁelds up to 5 T at tempera-
tures from 2 to 300 K. RTSIRM curves were obtained by applying
a ﬁeld of 2.5 T at room temperature, and measuring the rema-
nent magnetization upon cooling to 10 K, and then warming back

to 300 K. The AC susceptibility curves are measured for variable
frequencies (1–1000 Hz) in the temperature range 2–300 K.

To estimate the particle size using ZFC data, the T P temper-
atures were identiﬁed directly from ZFC curves and the particle
volume was obtained by the Néel–Arrhenius Law:

KV
kBT

τ = τ0e
where T = T P, τ is the measuring time, τ0 is a constant char-
−11 s), V is volume and kB is
acteristic of the material (10
Boltzmann’s constant. After mathematical manipulation the above
equation can be rewritten as
V = 25kBT
K

−9–10

The volume was estimated considering particles with spheri-
cal geometry and Fh anisotropy constant of K = 1.7× 105 J/m3
(Rodmacq, 1984). The values of constant of anisotropy K of
Fh available in the literature are still under debate and could
be a source of uncertainty in this estimate. The range of K
values reported in the literature include: 3.6× 105 J/m3 (Gilles
et al., 2000); 3.12× 105 J/m3 (Duarte et al., 2006); 1.0× 105 J/m3
(Berquó et al., 2009); 4.7× 105–1.5× 104 J/m3 (Silva et al., 2008);
1.7× 105 J/m3 (Suzdalev et al., 1996). Another source of error is
related to the fact that the model used to calculate particle size
of natural Fh considered spherical particles. Previous work on
synthetic Fh (Erbs et al., 2008) suggests that these particles may
have an aspect ratio that is greater than 1. As such, the estimates
obtained here are considered upper limits and are useful to identify
particle size changes associated with the vents temperature.

MÖSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPY
A conventional constant-acceleration spectrometer (Institute for
Rock Magnetism, University of Minnesota) was used in trans-
mission geometry with a 57Co/Rh source, using α-Fe at room
temperature to calibrate isomer shifts (ISs) and velocity scale. The
magnetic hyperﬁne parameters such as magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld
(BHF), IS, and quadrupole splitting (QS) were ﬁtted using the
NORMOS program (Brand, 1987).

HEAT TREATMENT OF HIOLO MAT FLOCS
The Hiolo mat was subjected to heating experiments in an oven to
determine the temperature at which the Fh-like minerals trans-
formed to hematite. One mat sample (Hiolo) was dried and
divided in ﬁve aliquots. One part was kept without thermal treat-
ment and the other four aliquots were used for thermal treatment
at different temperatures. The heating procedure started and ﬁn-
ished always with samples at room temperature reaching a maxi-
mum temperature (T max) of 400, 500, 600, or 800˚C. After the oven
reached T max the samples were maintained at that temperature for
about 20 min, and then samples were cooled inside the oven. Pow-
der XRD measurements were conducted for mat samples using a
PANalytical X-Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer equipped with
a cobalt source and high speed detector (X-Clerator; Laboratory of
R. Lee Penn, Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota).
The data were collected over the range of 10–90 2θ˚, with a scan rate

of 0.6˚/min, and data are compared to reference powder diffraction
patterns. Mössbauer spectra were also collected for the heat treated
mat, as described in Section “Mössbauer Spectroscopy.”

ELEMENTAL ANALYSES
Thawed Loihi Fe mat samples were prepared for elemental analysis
(Aqueous Geochemistry Laboratory, Department of Earth Sci-
ences, University of Minnesota) by 3× centrifugation and rinsing
steps (18.2 Ω Milli-Q water), followed by drying for 24 h at 50˚C.
The dried samples were dissolved in 6 mL of a 50/50 mixture of
Trace Grade HCl and HNO3, and diluted with 18.2 Ω water to
a total volume of 30 mL. Major elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr,
Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Si, Sr, Zn) were measured using
a Thermo Scientiﬁc iCAP 6500 dual view Inductively Coupled
Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer. The mat solutions were
diluted for analysis with a cesium matrix modiﬁer and yttrium as
an internal standard. For trace metal analysis, the dissolved sam-
ples were diluted 40×, and 40 ppb of In internal standard was
added. Trace elements (Be, Al, Sc, Ti, V, Ga, As, Se, Rb, Y, Zr, Mo,

XSERIES 2 ICP-MS w/ESI PC3 Peltier cooled spray chamber, SC-
FAST injection loop, and SC-4 autosampler. All elements except
Li, Be, Al, were analyzed using He/H2 collision–reaction mode.

To quantify organic carbon contents in several mats, 7–25 mg
of material was leached in 0.1 N HCl, dried, reweighed, loaded into
tin capsules, and analyzed using a Costech CHN 4010 elemental
combustion system.

RESULTS
IRON X-RAY ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY
Microprobe Fe EXAFS spectra were collected for fresh and 4˚C
aged Loihi Fe microbial mats (Ula Nui, Lohiau, Naha, and Pohaku;
slurp samples; Table 1). The microprobe EXAFS data are pre-
sented in Figure 1 along with bulk EXAFS data and selected
reference spectra of Fe oxyhydroxides (goethite, two-line Fh, and
Juan de Fuca Ridge biogenic Fe oxyhydroxide). Point measure-
ments from different particle aggregates within the mat samples
indicate that Fe speciation was homogeneous at a spatial scale of
10 μm2. Comparison between the microprobe and bulk Fe EXAFS
spectra for these mat ﬂocs shows that the Fe speciation measured
at the microscale is also representative of the bulk Fe speciation
(Figure 1; Table 2).

Iron EXAFS spectra (Figure A1 in Appendix) for the Ula Nui
mat were collected on samples with different storage (frozen under
N2, frozen in ambient atmosphere, and aged in ambient seawa-
ter at 4˚C) and preparation (thawed under N2, thawed/rinsed in
ambient atmosphere, and thawed/rinsed/dried at 40˚C) on three
different instruments (SSRL 2-3, ALS 10.3.2, and APS 20-BM).
These spectra are very similar despite different storage, handling,
and instruments. Although there is a perceptible line-shape differ-
ence in the EXAFS spectrum for the 4˚C aged sample (Ula Nui C)
at k = 7.5 Å
−1, the biggest difference among these Ula Nui spectra
is observed in the amplitude of ﬂuorescence versus transmission
mode measurements. We interpret the lower amplitude in the ﬂu-
orescence mode data to be over-absorption effects as the Loihi
mats are up to 45.6% by weight Fe (Table 2). These observations

hold true for other mats examined by replicate EXAFS measure-
ments. Therefore, in Figure 1 only representative EXAFS spectra
from Loihi mats are displayed while a full summary of spectra are
available in Figure A2 in Appendix.

In Figure 1, several spectral features are highlighted for the
Loihi mats and reference minerals. The Fe EXAFS spectra col-
lected for the Loihi mats have similarities with two-line Fh in terms
of line-shape, amplitude, and phase. In the Fourier transformed
data, a corresponding reduction or absence of the longer peak
(R + ΔR = 3.2 Å) in the second Fe–Fe shell is observed (except for
Pohaku; Figure 1). For the Fe oxyhydroxide goethite, the spectral
feature observed in k-range= 7–8 Å
−1 corresponds to corner-
sharing Fe-O octahedra and the three-dimensional character of
the structure (Toner et al., 2009). The EXAFS data indicate that the
mats are composed primarily of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide phases with
less three-dimensional ordering than two-line Fh. Therefore, these
Fe(III) phases will be referred to as natural short-range ordered
Fh (FhSRO) hereafter.

Iron and Mn oxidation state maps, coupled with total Fe, Mn,
Ca, and Ti distributions, were collected for an intact surface crust
sample from the Ula Nui site (Figure 2). This sample was frozen
shipboard under N2 and analyzed at the synchrotron in the absence
of O2. Noticeable, discontinuous black banding can be observed
visually in the laminated mats and these bands are represented
in the X-ray ﬂuorescence maps as regions of higher Mn ﬂuores-
cence intensity [e.g., top of Region I (R1) and II (R2) in Figure 2].
XANES ﬁtting of multiple energy maps collected across the Mn K-
edge also indicates that these Mn-rich regions are Mn(IV)-oxides.
The valence state is conﬁrmed by analysis of Mn K-edge XANES
spectra for this sample (data not shown). The majority of the
mat proﬁle is then dominated by Fe(III) particles, although a zone
dominated by reduced Fe(II) was mapped at the top of R2. Cal-
cium is also enriched by more than an order of magnitude at
the top of R2, and these Ca-rich zones envelop the particles in
which Fe(II) is present. No micro-EXAFS spectra were collected
on this sample and therefore the full speciation of the Fe in discrete
regions is unknown, but possible candidate solid-phase Fe species
include carbonates, sulﬁdes, or basalt. The Fe(II)-rich particles are

expected for phenocrysts of olivine or feldspar. Instead, carbon-

SYNCHROTRON X-RAY DIFFRACTION AND PAIR DISTRIBUTION
FUNCTION ANALYSIS
Five Loihi mat samples (BT37, Ula Nui-A, Ula Nui-B, Spillway A,
and Lohiau A) from the 2006 cruise were analyzed by SR-XRD, and
all contain a Fh-like phase based on the presence of diffuse scatter-
ing features similar to those observed for the synthetic Fh reference
(Figure 3). With exception of sample Ula Nui-B, the most signif-
icant features occur at d-spacings of ∼1.5 and ∼2.55 Å and are
indicative of Fh (e.g., Jambor and Dutrizac, 1998; Michel et al.,
2007a). The speciﬁc crystalline phases attributable to the sharper
peaks evident in samples Ula Nui-A, Spillway A, and Lohiau A
(Figure 3) could not be positively identiﬁed due to uncertainty
in the relative intensities and possibility of multiple phases. Sam-
ple Ula Nui-A contains an additional mineral phase with peaks
at d-spacings ∼7.2, 3.5, 2.5, 1.4, and 1.2 Å, that can be indexed
as Na-rich birnessite (e.g., ICSD 68916). The presence of birnes-
site in the Ula Nui mat is consistent with Mn EXAFS data for the
Ula Nui site (Edwards et al., 2011). Consistent with the SR-XRD
results, the total scattering data collected to higher Q-space values
and presented as the reduced structure functions for these samples
(Figure 4) are also dominated by features similar to those observed
for the synthetic Fh reference.

The Fourier transform of these reduced structure functions
results in the PDFs, which contain structural information in real-
space for the Loihi mat FhSRO (Figure 5). The ﬁrst two major
features in the PDFs for the BT37, Ula Nui-A, Ula Nui-B, Spill-
way A, and Lohiau A mats correspond primarily to the average
bond lengths for Si and Fe with oxygen. The peaks at ∼1.61 Å
correspond to Si-O correlations in the ﬁrst oxygen shell of Si in
tetrahedral coordination. This bond length agrees well with that
reported in the literature (e.g., Grimley et al., 1990; Poulsen et al.,
1995) and for the am-SiO2 reference compound (Table 3). The
second major peaks at ∼1.98 Å correspond to Fe-O correlations
in the ﬁrst oxygen shell of Fe. Iron(III) in synthetic Fh is dom-
inantly in octahedral coordination with oxygen (O and/or OH)
although recent studies (Michel et al., 2007b, 2010; Maillot et al.,
2011; Mikutta, 2011) support the presence of a minor amount
(10–25%) of tetrahedrally coordinated Fe(III). As such, the Fe-O
correlation for the natural samples may have bond length contri-
butions from both types of coordination environments. The Fe-O
peak is slightly asymmetric and also has a small shoulder peak
centered at ∼2.13 Å. Similar Fe-O bond lengths were reported for
synthetic Fh (Maillot et al., 2011) based on EXAFS spectroscopy
data. The ﬁtted Fe-O distances for the Loihi mat samples also
correspond well with the Fh reference (Table 3), although the dis-
tances for the reference were slightly shorter at ∼1.96 and 2.11 Å,
respectively. Note that although the Fe-O correlation, particularly
in the case of the reference Fh, is expected to have contributions
from tetrahedrally coordinated Fe (average bond length ∼1.88 Å)
only two Gaussian functions were used to avoid over ﬁtting.

erence. Also based on the PDF for the reference, a Si. . .Si distance
corresponding to corner-sharing silica tetrahedra is expected at
∼3.07 Å (Figure 6) but is possibly obscured in the natural samples
due, in part, to overlapping correlations resulting from the con-
nectivity of FeO4/6 polyhedra. The peak at ∼3.03 Å in synthetic Fh
is dominated by Fe. . .Fe and O. . .O correlations for edge-sharing
Fe octahedra and the next major peak at ∼3.44 Å has contribu-
tions from corner-sharing FeO4/6 polyhedra (Michel et al., 2010).
These edge- and corner-sharing Fe contributions are not clearly
resolved in the mat samples due to the presence of additional fea-
tures (Figure 5) the most signiﬁcant of which occur at ∼3.14, 3.31,
and 3.6 Å (Table 3). Previous work (Pokrovski et al., 2003) showed
that in varying concentrations of Si solutions, the presence of one
to two Si atoms was detected at 3.18± 0.03 Å in the second shell

boring Fe octahedra via corners (Figure 6). Other bonding motifs
are also possible (Figure 6) and longer Si. . .Fe path lengths could
explain the features at distances of ∼3.3 and ∼3.6 Å.

With exception of the degree of PDF decay, the most signiﬁ-
cant differences between the Loihi mat FhSRO and Fh reference are
in the range 2.5 < r < 4 Å. As described above, differences in this
region of the PDFs appear primarily due to Si. . .Fe pair correla-
tions. Interestingly, the pair correlations beyond r ≈ 4 Å in BT37,

coercive force (H C) and remanent magnetization (M R). Above
T P value, the hysteresis loops display only the behavior expected
for unblocked particles, the loops are closed, and H C and M R are
zero. For some samples the hysteresis loops are open above T P as a
result of the contribution of trace Ti-magnetite impurity (see also
Figure A4 in Appendix). The particle diameters calculated by this
method range from 3.5 to 4.5 nm for the Loihi Seamount natural
FhSRO minerals.

MÖSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPY
Mössbauer spectra were obtained at room temperature and 4.2 K
for selected Fe mat samples in order to conﬁrm the valence state of
Fe and the magnetic state of the FhSRO. Detailed chemical, struc-
tural, and magnetic information can be obtained with this method
(Murad and Cashion, 2004), as the spectra depend on the miner-
alogy, lattice type, abundance of structural defects, and magnetic
properties of the sample. The type of magnetic ordering (ferro-
, ferri-, or antiferromagnetic) can be further tested by applying
external magnetic ﬁelds, and effects related to thermal relaxation in
nanoparticles (superparamagnetism) are investigated by obtaining
spectra at different temperatures.

The room temperature spectra for the Fe mat samples from the
Spillway A, Tower, Hiolo A, Ula Nui-A, Ula Nui-B/C, Lohiau A, and
BT37 areas of Loihi Seamount have a Fe3+
doublet and magnetic
hyperﬁne parameters corresponding to Fh (Table 5; Figure 8).
The presence of a doublet in a Mössbauer spectrum is a feature
associated with paramagnetism and/or superparamagnetism. A
superparamagnetic phase has magnetic order below the block-
ing temperature. The Mössbauer spectra of Fe mats taken at 4.2 K
have magnetic order and they exhibit a sextet. The magnetic hyper-
ﬁne parameters of Loihi mat samples at 4.2 K agree with the ones
found in the literature for Fh (Berquó et al., 2009). A decrease was
observed in the magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld (BHF) as compared with
synthetic Fh; this feature is associated with structural defects. Ferri-
hydrite, speciﬁcally two-line Fh, has signiﬁcant defects in both the
tetrahedral and octahedral Fe(III) sites (Michel et al., 2010), and
these natural FhSRO samples from Loihi Seamount seem to have
extra Fe(III)-site lattice defects due perhaps to Fe substitution and
vacancies.

HEAT TREATMENT OF THE HIOLO MAT
A Loihi Seamount mat from the Hiolo area was thermally treated
to determine the temperature at which the natural FhSRO converts
to hematite under oxic conditions. The temperature dependent
conversion was monitored by powder XRD and room tempera-
ture Mössbauer spectroscopy. The XRD pattern obtained for the
unheated Hiolo mat sample is presented in Figure 9. The pattern
has the two broad lines characteristic of Fh and is in agreement
with the SR-XRD data for Ula Nui-A, Ula Nui-B/C, BT37, Spill-
way A, and Lohiau A (Figure 3). In addition to the Fh pattern,
several sharp diffraction lines are evident for the sample under
different conditions: (1) no thermal treatment, halite, and Fh; (2)
sample treated at 400˚C, halite, Fh, and minor contribution of
anhydrite (CaSO4); (3) sample treated at 600˚C, halite, hematite
(α-Fe2O3), and minor contribution of aegirine (NaFeSi2O6); and
(4) sample treated at 800˚C, halite, hematite, and minor contribu-
tion aegirine. The samples heated at 600 and 800˚C have dominant,
sharp diffraction lines consistent with the mineral hematite.

FIGURE 5 | Real-space PDFs or G(r ) for the ﬁve natural samples
compared to experimental PDFs for Fh and amorphous SiO2
references. (A) The strong attenuation in the features of the PDFs with
increasing r for the natural samples indicates smaller coherent scattering
domain (CSD) sizes and increased disorder relative to synthetic Fh. Sample
Ula Nui-B shows more structure at higher r due to birnessite phase
impurity. (B) Comparison of the short-range order for these samples.
Similarities between natural samples and synthetic references for Fh and
amorphous silica are highlighted.

Ula Nui-A, Spillway A, and Lohiau A closely resemble synthetic Fh
(Figure A3 in Appendix) suggesting that the intermediate-range
order and connectivity of Fe polyhedra are maintained over these
length scales. The PDF peaks decay at r ≈ 16 Å for BT37, Spill-
way A, and Lohiau A suggesting that these mat samples are more
disordered and have smaller CSD sizes compared with synthetic
two-line Fh which decays at r ≈ 23 Å (Figure A3 in Appendix).
Estimated CSD sizes for Ula Nui-A and Ula Nui-B (Table 3) are
signiﬁcantly larger (∼23 and 37 Å, respectively) however, the pres-
ence of relatively crystalline impurities in these samples prevents
an accurate estimate for the Fh fractions, which are assumed to be
less crystalline than the associated impurity phases. Shifts in peak
positions for the natural samples relative to Fh at higher r (>4 Å)
may be attributable, in part, to increasing strain with decreasing
CSD size, and this trend is consistent with previous studies of syn-
thetic Fh in which the size and/or Fe(III) vacancy content varied
(Michel et al., 2007a).

ples are shown in Figure 7 and Table 4 summarizes the peak

assumptions used is included in the Section “Magnetism.”

superparamagnetic phase. The Hiolo mat samples heated to 500˚C
showed the presence of at least two components, a sextet represent-
ing magnetic order at room temperature and a Fe3+
doublet. The
doublet represents the contribution of Fh that was not converted
to a more stable phase, while the sextet does not have parameters
that correspond to a speciﬁc Fe phase. The Fe phase(s) observed
at 500˚C are intermediates in the conversion process from nat-
ural FhSRO to hematite. In contrast, the spectra at 600 and 800˚C
suggest the presence of hematite. At 600˚C the BHF is reduced as
compared with a stoichiometric hematite, indicating the presence
of lattice defects in the conversion product. The data at 800˚C show
magnetic hyperﬁne parameters similar to stoichiometric hematite
and suggest the thermal treatment completely converted FhSRO to
hematite at that temperature.

DISCUSSION
MAT COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF IRON-BEARING PHASES
X-ray ﬂuorescence mapping of major element distributions with
depth show that spatial heterogeneity and geochemical zona-
tion occur in layered mats such as at the Ula Nui site. The
low-temperature (<2˚C) Fe mats at Ula Nui are considered to
be modern analogs to ancient umber deposits that form from
Fe and Si-rich ultra-diffuse hydrothermal ﬂuids (Edwards et al.,
2011). Total cell densities reach values as high as 1.4× 109 cells/g
dry wt. in the Fe/Mn mats, and known Fe-oxidizing bacteria
(e.g., Zeta-proteobacteria such as Mariprofundus ferrooxydans)
that have been identiﬁed in these mats are likely supported by
the advection of ﬂuids containing 40–150 mM Fe (Glazer and
Rouxel, 2009; Edwards et al., 2011). The reductive transformation
of the Si-rich FhSRO would not be predicted to occur substantially

FIGURE 6 | Schematic illustration of three possible silicate surface
complexes on an idealized portion of the ferrihydrite structure. Fe(III)
(green) is shown in octahedral coordination with O (red). Si (yellow) is
tetrahedrally coordinated with O (SiO4). Approximate Si–Fe distances for
SiO4 linked (1) bidentate to two neighboring Fe octahedra via corners
(∼3.15 Å), (2) monodentate to a doubly/triply coordinated O (∼3.3 Å), and
(3) monodentate to a singly coordinated O (∼3.6 Å). Si. . .Si distances
(∼3.07 Å) indicate formation of silica polymers, possibly also on the
ferrihydrite surface.

Mössbauer spectra tell a more detailed story of the mineral
conversion (Figure 10). The Mössbauer spectra for the Hiolo mat,
unheated, and after 400˚C treatment, exhibit a doublet indicating a

under these low Fe ﬂuxes, and therefore the EXAFS signature of
Fe(III) in the FhSRO dominates these samples. The Fe(II)-rich
zones shown in R2 of Figure 2 occur several millimeters below
the surface of the mat where oxygen concentrations drop to only a
few micromolar; the Fe(II)-mineralization may represent regions
of localized microbial Fe-reduction using ﬁxed organic carbon
(e.g., ﬁlaments and extracellular material) resulting in the precip-
itation of Fe(II)-rich phases such as carbonates or sulﬁdes. Given
the strong co-localization between Fe(II) and Ca in this region
of the mat, carbonates are the most likely candidate phase, but
Fe K-edge XANES were not collected in this region for quanti-
tative analysis. Although 16S rRNA sequences of DNA extracted
from Ula Nui mats has not been reported, and enrichments for
Fe(III)-reducing bacteria from Ula Nui have been unsuccessful (D.
Emerson, personal communication), the potential presence and

activity of Fe-reducing bacteria is plausible given the isolation of
Fe(III)-reducing bacteria from Fe mats at the Loihi summit (Bailey
et al., 2009; Emerson, 2009) and the thermodynamic favorability
of coupling organic matter oxidation to Fe(III)-reduction within
interior anoxic portions of these mats. Reduction of biogenic Fe
oxides has also been demonstrated at the Tonga–Kermadec Arc
(Langley et al., 2009).

spectra relative to two-line Fh (except for Pohaku). Mikutta (2011)
recently reported a similar observation for synthetic Fh formed in
the presence of varying amounts of organic ligands and attributed
the decrease in intensity of this feature with increasing L/Fe ratio
to a reduced number of nearest Fe neighbors. Iron EXAFS spectra
with characteristics similar to the Loihi FhSRO are reported in the
presence of Si (Masion et al., 2001; Doelsch et al., 2003; Voegelin
et al., 2010; Boland et al., 2011), P (Rose et al., 1997; Voegelin et al.,
2010), and organic molecules (Vilge-Ritter et al., 1999; Mikutta,
2011). While the organic C content of the mats is low (∼0.3 wt.
%), the Si:Fe mole ratio for the Fe-rich mats is 0.107–0.298, and
the P:Fe ratio is 0.0280–0.168 (Table 2). Based on these EXAFS
observations, we hypothesize that Si, and perhaps P, is reducing
the degree of structural order in Loihi Seamount natural FhSRO
phases to an extent less than that typically observed for synthetic
two-line Fh. In addition, we propose that the natural FhSRO we
detect in all but one Loihi Fe mat is preserved from recrystal-
lization to Fh or other Fe oxyhydroxides such as goethite by the
presence of inorganic ligands (Si, P).

Consistent with Fe(III) polymerization in the presence of
strongly sorbing ligands, Mössbauer spectroscopy reveals that
the Loihi Seamount FhSRO phases have more structural defects
than synthetic Fh. This is observed as a decrease in the magnetic
hyperﬁne ﬁeld (BHF). Ferrihydrite, speciﬁcally two-line Fh, has
signiﬁcant defects in both the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe(III)

FIGURE 10 | The Mössbauer spectra show that before thermal
treatment the sample is represented by a (superparamagnetic) Fe3+
doublet. After thermal treatment at 400˚C the material still remains a

to a more stable phase, hematite.

sites (Michel et al., 2010), and these natural FhSRO samples from
Loihi Seamount seem to have extra Fe(III)-site lattice defects due
perhaps to Fe substitution and vacancies.

The SR-XRD (Figure 3) and total X-ray scattering data in the
form of reduced structure functions (Figure 4) reveal that the
high-Q (i.e., high angle) scattering maxima for the ﬁve natural mat
samples are similar, but not identical, to the synthetic two-line Fh
reference. In the case of BT37, Spillway A, and Lohiau A (Tables 1
and 2), the samples with the most clearly resolvable fraction of nat-
ural FhSRO, the comparison to pure synthetic Fh suggests that these
samples bear some structural similarities. Comparison of the PDFs
for these samples conﬁrms similarities in short- and intermediate-
range structure and provides further insight as to the structural
association of Si and Fe in the nanostructured matrix (Figures 5
and 6).

The Si:Fe mole ratio measured for the mats by ICP-OES are
0.245, 0.107, and 0.207, respectively. The total measured Si:Fe mole
ratios for Ula Nui-A and Ula Nui-B/C mats are 0.289 and 0.227,
respectively (Table 2). Assuming that these samples are primarily

single-phase, the differences in the region of the PDFs between
2.5 < r < 4 Å (Figure 5) suggest that Si is predominantly associ-
ated with the FhSRO surfaces, perhaps in the form of a poorly
ordered silica coating. Alternatively, in the case that these samples
are multi-phasic then the observed PDFs could also be explained
by at least two phases; one comprised of a Fh-like core, perhaps
with a Si-rich coating, and a second comprised of an Fe-bearing
amorphous SiO2 phase, similar to that observed by Pokrovski et al.
(2003). Either scenario would also be consistent with the obser-
vation that features at higher r (>4 Å) in the PDFs show a return
to Fh-like ordering, albeit with smaller CSD sizes. In addition,
although the correlations attributable to edge- and corner-sharing
Fe polyhedra at ∼3.03 and 3.44 Å, respectively, are not clearly
delineated in the PDFs for the mat samples it is possible that
they exist but are obscured by other pair correlations involv-
ing Si. As discussed above, further evidence for the presence of
edge-sharing Fe polyhedra is indicated by the EXAFS for all the
Loihi mats. The presence of such polyhedral connectivity would be
required in order to produce the intermediate-range Fh-like order-
ing observed in the region 4 < r < ∼12 Å (Figure A3 in Appendix).
Structural information over these longer distances would not be
available from previous (and present) EXAFS results since the
range of inter-atomic distances measured, particularly in the case
of Fh, are typically less than ∼4–5 Å. In summary, the PDFs indi-
cate the presence of limited intermediate-range Fh-like structural
ordering, which suggests that silica is not structurally incorpo-
rated in ferrihydrite. Differences in short-range ordering of the
natural samples relative to Si-free Fh suggest that the Fh particles
are coated with Si.

PARTICLE DIMENSIONS AND INTERACTIONS OF IRON-BEARING
PHASES
The magnetic behavior of the Loihi Seamount FhSRO was evaluated
since particle coatings such as Si or organic matter are expected
to diminish or completely inhibit magnetic interactions of anti-
ferromagnetic Fe oxyhydroxides. In a superparamagnetic system
when particles are cooled without an applied ﬁeld, the magnetic
moments are randomly oriented and the resulting induced mag-
netization is around zero at 0 K. With increasing temperature of
the system and in the presence of an external applied ﬁeld, the
magnetic moments begin to ﬂuctuate, then align in the direction
of the external ﬁeld, leading to an increase of the total magneti-
zation (Chantrell et al., 1991; Dormann et al., 1997) and a peak
is observed in the ZFC curve (Figure 7). Above the peak tem-
perature (T P) the thermal energy of disorder is higher than the
ordering energy and a superparamagnetic behavior results, leading
to a decrease of the total magnetization with increasing tempera-
ture following the Curie–Weiss law. The presence of a maximum in
the ZFC curve is therefore associated with the transition between
magnetically relaxing superparamagnetic (unblocked state) and
thermally stable magnetization (blocked state). The FC curve rep-
resents the superparamagnetic system cooled down in the presence
of an external magnetic ﬁeld.

Current models suggest that particle coatings prevent mag-
netic interactions for antiferromagnetic systems (Berquó et al.,
2009), although this may not prevent magnetic interactions for
ferrimagnetic phases such as maghemite and magnetite. Since Fh

particles are antiferromagnetic, we apply the antiferromagnetic
model to understand Loihi ZFC/FC curves. Berquó et al. (2009)
veriﬁed that synthetic agglomerated Fh particles, without coat-
ing and magnetically interacting, showed a T P shifted to higher
temperatures as compared with the same particles coated, thus
considered without magnetic interactions. The T P estimated from
ZFC curves of Loihi samples are similar to the ones obtained
by Berquó et al. (2009) for coated synthetic Fh, and this result
strongly suggests that the natural FhSRO particles are also individ-
ually wrapped in a way that prevents magnetic interactions. The
coating agents that could create this magnetic masking include
organic matter or Si in the environment where the particles pre-
cipitate. The Loihi Seamount Fe mats are enriched in Si, and Si
bonding to the natural FhSRO is well supported by our X-ray
scattering data and analysis. In addition to agreeing with com-
plementary data, this result makes it possible to obtain a better
estimate of magnetic particle size (Table 4) considering that there
is no shift in the peak temperature due to magnetic interaction.
The ZFC peak reﬂects exclusively the changes in particle volume
without undesired effects that may contribute to its shift.

Differences in the particle size estimates from low-temperature
magnetic data and the CSD sizes from PDF analysis for samples Ula
Nui-A, Ula Nui-B, Lohiau A, and Spillway A are evident (Table 4)
and point toward the presence of structural disorder in the natural
FhSRO. These two types of data can be considered as complemen-
tary in the sense that the low-temperature magnetic data indicate
an upper limit for the maximum physical dimensions of the parti-
cles, while the PDF reveals the average dimensions over which the
atoms in the structure scatter coherently. It is possible for the CSD
to equal the particle size, but this is not always the case, in particular
for Fh (e.g., Michel et al., 2008). In principal, for a monodisperse
nanocrystalline material (i.e., with virtually no structural disor-
der), the PDF peaks decay as r approaches the average maximum
dimensions of the particle; therefore, particle size and CSD size
are effectively equal. For highly disordered or amorphous struc-
tures, the CSD size can be substantially smaller than the physical
size of the particles due to the effects of static/dynamic disorder,
which attenuate the features in the PDF at higher r. It is worth
noting that it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to correlate CSD size
with actual particle size, in particular for natural samples, from
PDF data alone since the CSD size estimates become increasingly
uncertain for polydisperse materials and/or if multiple structural
phases are present, as is the case for natural samples Ula Nui-A and
-B. However, for Lohiau A and Spillway A, natural samples that are
dominantly FhSRO, the observed discrepancy between average par-
ticle size and CSD size suggests strongly that these samples have
intrinsic static and dynamic forms of structural disorder. Past stud-
ies of pure synthetic Fh (Michel et al., 2010; Cismasu et al., 2011)
have suggested that the bulk structure exhibits size-dependent lat-
tice strain and defects in the form of vacancies. In addition, size-
and defect-driven restructuring of the Fh surfaces is also possible,
although poorly understood at present. Evidence for lattice strain
and structural defects in natural FhSRO is difﬁcult to discern in
the present case due, in part, to the presence of minor crystalline
impurity phases such as birnessite. Additional complexity due to
the presence of compositional impurities and/or adsorbed species
such as silica or organic matter are also factors and may account

for the discrepancies between average coherent scattering body
size and particle size.

PARTICLE STABILITY OF IRON-BEARING PHASES
The local coordination of Fe in Loihi mats was remarkably insen-
sitive to sample processing, storage, and handling procedures such
as freezing, drying, and storage in seawater up to 1 year (Figure 1;
Figures A1 and A2 in Appendix). The short-range order of the
Naha and Lohiau Fe mats (Figure A1 in Appendix; data not
shown for Lohiau) did not change after aging for 1 year at 4˚C.
Although the FhSRO phases might be expected to transform to
more stable minerals such as goethite (Penn et al., 2006), no recrys-
tallization was observed. The stability of the local structure of
the FhSRO as a function of time and temperature is consistent
with non-interacting particles. In addition, the Loihi Seamount Fe
mats did not convert to the more stable hematite phase during a
400˚C thermal treatment. Pure Fh is expected to rapidly convert
to hematite between 300 and 400˚C (Cornell and Schwertmann,
2003). However, surface coatings on Fh, such as adsorbed Si or
organic molecules, are known to slow or inhibit its transformation
to crystalline products (Cornell and Schwertmann, 1979; Ander-
son and Benjamin, 1985; Campbell et al., 2002). Stable Fe minerals
such as goethite were not observed at any of the Loihi ﬁeld sites or
under any of the experimental conditions below 400˚C. All EXAFS,
PDF, and magnetism data from the present study point to Si parti-
cle coatings that limit chemical interactions among natural FhSRO
particles in Loihi mats.

In addition to limited particle–particle interactions, chemical,
and biological reactions involving Fe(II) may be limited in Loihi
mats and contribute to stability of the FhSRO. The low activity of
Fe-reducing bacteria in Loihi mats suggests that the FhSRO phases
are not subject to intense biological reductive alteration (Emerson,
2009), although some Fe-reducing bacteria are known to solu-
bilize Fe(II) from Si-enriched Fh (Percak-Dennett et al., 2011).
Despite the constant source of Fe(II) to all but the “dead” Naha
site, Fe(II) induced reduction of FhSRO may be negligible based on
results from synthetic Si-enriched Fh studies (Jones et al., 2009;
Boland et al., 2011). For example, Si:Fe ratios of 0.7 have been
shown to inhibit Fe(II)-induced recrystallization of Fh to goethite
at pH 6.5 (Boland et al., 2011). However, the data presented here
does not address the potential for exchange between vent ﬂuid
Fe(II) and FeSRO, and there is evidence that Si-enriched Fh phases
retain chemical reactivity. For example, Si:Fe mole ratios up to
0.5 can be achieved without blocking all reactive Fh surface sites
due to surface-bound silicate oligomers (Swedlund et al., 2009).
In addition, Si-enriched Fh phases are soluble in the presence of
organic molecules, such as oxalate and acetate (Carlson and Schw-
ertmann, 1981; Percak-Dennett et al., 2011). We speculate that the
low organic carbon content of the Loihi mats may limit both bio-
logical and chemical reductive dissolution reactions. These factors
combined suggest that the FeSRO signatures observed at Loihi may
be resistant to diagenetic processes and persist over long periods
of time.

IRON MICROBIAL MATS AT DIFFUSE HYDROTHERMAL VENTS
Iron and Si-rich microbial mats are observed in shallow and
deep marine hydrothermal systems. The number of published
observations of Fe microbial mats indicates that these deposits

may be common features associated with diffuse venting. Dif-
fuse hydrothermal vents at seamounts and submarine volcanoes
associated with island arcs and mid-ocean ridge spreading centers
host Fe (and Si) microbial mats, for example: Loihi Seamount (Karl
et al., 1988; Edwards et al., 2011), Vailulu’u Seamount (Sudek et al.,
2009); Giggenbach Volcano, Kermadec Arc (Jones et al., 2008);
Axial Volcano, Juan de Fuca Ridge (Kennedy et al., 2003); South
Tonga Arc volcanoes (Langley et al., 2009; Forget et al., 2010); Lil-
liput vent ﬁeld, Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Dekov et al., 2010). Among
these studies, the Fe mineralogy, when reported, is resound-
ingly “amorphous” Fe oxyhydroxide, ferrihydrite, and occasionally
goethite. A recent review of the microbiology of active seamount Fe
microbial mats indicates that Zeta-proteobacteria and/or Epsilon-
proteobacteria are shared among sites (Emerson and Moyer, 2010),
even though inter-site diversity is high (Davis and Moyer, 2008).
A cultured representative of the Zeta-proteobacteria from Loihi
Seamount (Emerson et al., 2007), M. ferrooxydans, is an Fe oxidizer
that produces ferrihydrite-like phases in fresh ﬁlaments of twisted
stalks (Chan et al., 2011). Frequent observations of Fe-encrusted
ﬁlamentous structures at diffuse vents, and the apparent ubiquity
of Zeta-proteobacteria in the mats, suggest that Loihi Seamount
mats may represent common depositional environments at the
modern seaﬂoor. The present study indicates that the presence of
Si and organic templates are both primary geochemical factors in
the structure of Fe-bearing phases as well as the preservation of
the phases as a function of time and temperature.

CONCLUSION
Certain characteristics of Fe oxyhydroxide phases – particle size,
crystallinity – are known to respond to solution conditions such
as Si concentration, as well as factors that inﬂuence the rate of
precipitation, such as temperature and pH (Cornell and Schwert-
mann, 2003). The overarching goal for this study is to determine
whether Fe oxyhydroxide phases can be used to interpret the bio-
geochemical conditions of past depositional settings. In particular,
we are concerned with whether the characteristics of fresh Fe oxy-
hydroxide phases are preserved over time. As a ﬁrst step toward this
goal, we examined the Fe-rich, ﬂocculant microbial mats hosted by
active (and recently active) vents of the Loihi Seamount. The mats
are composed of nanoparticulate ferrihydrite (Fh)-like phases with
short-range structural order (FhSRO) at all but one site (Pohaku)
irrespective of depth or temperature. The Loihi FhSRO are pri-
marily Fe(III) with little particle-to-particle variability in the local
coordination environment of Fe within a single mat; although
careful sampling of the Ula Nui site revealed isolated microzones
of solid-phase Fe(II)-enrichment beneath the mat–seawater inter-
face. For our entire sample set, maximum particle diameters of
3.5–4.6 nm (magnetism data) were found to be positively cor-
related with maximum vent ﬂuid temperature, while CSD sizes
(PDF analysis) as small as 1.6 nm were observed, and are inversely
correlated with vent ﬂuid temperature. These data indicate that
the Loihi FhSRO phases have intrinsic static and dynamic forms
of structural disorder, likely from lattice strain and vacancy or
substitutional impurity defects. Magnetic data and PDF analysis
both point to FhSRO particles coated by Si. The Loihi mat FhSRO
phases did not transform to other Fe mineral phases in response to
freezing, drying, aging in seawater for up to 1 year, or standard heat
treatments under oxic conditions. We hypothesize that Si increases

structural disorder and decreases CSD sizes in Loihi Seamount
mats, and propose that the natural FhSRO we detect is preserved
from recrystallization to Fh, or other Fe oxyhydroxides such as
goethite, by the presence of Si, although P and organic molecules
could potentially contribute.

APPENDIX

Mineralogy of iron microbial mats

FIGURE A1 | Iron K-edge EXAFS spectra for the Ula Nui mats of Loihi
Seamount having different sample handling and data collection
conditions. The Ula Nui Crust was stored and analyzed frozen under N2 at
an SSRL microprobe beamline in ﬂuorescence mode. Ula Nui-A/B were
stored frozen, thawed, rinsed, and dried at 40˚C with analysis at the APS at
a bulk beamline in transmission mode. Ula Nui C was stored in ambient
seawater at 4˚C for 6 months, and was analyzed as rinsed/air-dry particles at
an ALS microprobe beamline in ﬂuorescence mode.

FIGURE A3 | Comparison of PDFs for BT37, Spillway A, and Lohiau A to
the Fh reference plotted as G(r )*r 2 versus r to amplify the features at
higher r values. Although subtle for the natural samples the features
>∼4 Å are reasonable similar to those of synthetic Fh. Note that the PDF
for Fh was also multiplied by 0.25 for comparison. Ula Nui-A and -B also
showed similar features but due to impurities (e.g., birnessite) were
excluded for clarity.

FIGURE A2 | Summary of all Fe K-edge EXAFS data collected for this
study. Samples described in Table 2.

FIGURE A4 |The RTSIM shows the typical behavior associated with the
presence of Ti-magnetite. The curves obtained on cooling (black circles)
and on warming (red circles) are displayed. Due to its high magnetization,
magnetite can be observed in the mats at very low concentrations.
