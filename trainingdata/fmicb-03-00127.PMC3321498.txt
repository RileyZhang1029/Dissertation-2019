Staphylococcus aureus is a typical human pathogen. Some animal S. aureus lineages have
derived from human strains following profound genetic adaptation determining a change
in host speciﬁcity. Due to the close relationship of animals with the environmental micro-
biome and resistome, animal staphylococcal strains also represent a source of resistance
determinants. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) emerged 50 years ago as a nosoco-
mial pathogen but in the last decade it has also become a frequent cause of infections
in the community. The recent ﬁnding that MRSA frequently colonizes animals, especially
livestock, has been a reason for concern, as it has revealed an expanded reservoir of
MRSA. While MRSA strains recovered from companion animals are generally similar to
human nosocomial MRSA, MRSA strains recovered from food animals appear to be spe-
ciﬁc animal-adapted clones. Since 2005, MRSA belonging to ST398 was recognized as
a colonizer of pigs and human subjects professionally exposed to pig farming. The “pig”
MRSA was also found to colonize other species of farmed animals, including horses, cat-
tle, and poultry and was therefore designated livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA. LA-MRSA
ST398 can cause infections in humans in contact with animals, and can infect hospitalized
people, although at the moment this occurrence is relatively rare. Other animal-adapted
MRSA clones have been detected in livestock, such as ST1 and ST9. Recently, ST130
MRSA isolated from bovine mastitis has been found to carry a novel mecA gene that
eludes detection by conventional PCR tests. Similar ST130 strains have been isolated from
human infections in UK, Denmark, and Germany at low frequency. It is plausible that the
increased attention to animal MRSA will reveal other strains with peculiar characteristics
that can pose a risk to human health.

INFECTIONS AND ANIMALS
Infectious diseases have accompanied humankind since its dawn.
However, it is not until the end of the last ice age, approxi-
mately 10,000 years ago when the agricultural revolution began,
that humans became more exposed to the pathogens of infectious
disease that have since shaped human history. In the previous era
when humans were hunter–gatherers, they moved nomadically
over vast territories. Then humans started breeding wild weeds
and domesticating animals –sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, poultry,
and horses– for food and labor. Stable settlements and proximity
to animals caused pathogens to thrive and spread between ani-
mals and humans, and infectious diseases become prominent in
inﬂuencing life and death (Porter, 1997). There began also the
sharing of bacterial species between animals and humans, and
co-evolution of pathogens with their hosts.

The heritage of the Neolithic Age continues today. It is esti-
mated that over 60% of the emerging human pathogens come
from animals (Cutler et al., 2010). To feed the growing human
population, there is an increasing demand for intensive animal
farming involving large numbers of animals, different species in
the same area, and the use of growth promoters and antibiotics.
These practices can facilitate the emergence of new pathogens,

including antibiotic-resistant organisms, and their transmission
to humans. In addition, food of animal origin can be a major
vehicle for animal pathogens and their spread can be ampliﬁed by
the market globalization.

FROM STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS TO
METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Staphylococcal infections are of major importance in both human
and veterinary medicine. Staphylococcus aureus is a major resident
or transient colonizer of the skin and the mucosa of humans and
primates. It occasionally lives on domestic animals, although these
are usually colonized by other species of staphylococci. When S.
aureus gains entry into the host, it is able to cause a variety of
infections, from mild skin infection to life threatening invasive
infections.

Staphylococcus aureus has the characteristic ability to rapidly
develop resistance to virtually any antibiotic drug coming into
clinical use (Pantosti et al., 2007). Resistance to methicillin – that
indicates resistance to all beta-lactam agents – was ﬁrst reported in
1961, the date that marks the appearance of Methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA). Methicillin resistance is due to the acquisi-
tion of the mecA gene, that encodes a new protein designated

MRSA: from animals to humans

PBP2a, belonging to a family of enzymes necessary in build-
ing the bacterial cell wall. PBP2a has a very low afﬁnity for
β-lactam antibiotics and confers resistance to methicillin and
the other beta-lactams (Pantosti et al., 2007). The mecA gene
is located on a mobile genetic element, named staphylococcal
cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) inserted in the S. aureus
chromosome upstream orf X (Katayama et al., 2000). Different
types of SCCmec can be distinguished on the basis of different
key elements present, that are the mec gene complex, compris-
ing mecA and its regulatory genes mecI and mecR1, and the ccr
genes complex comprising two different ccr recombinases that are
responsible for the mobility of the element (Ito et al., 2001, 2004;
Ma et al., 2002). To date, the website of the International Work-
ing Group on the Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome elements
(http://www.sccmec.org/Pages/SCC_TypesEN.html, accessed on
February 2, 2012) lists 11 types of SCCmec elements, originat-
ing from the combination of eight different ccr genes complex and
ﬁve different mec gene complex.

As MRSA is generated by the introduction of a mecA-carrying
element in a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (Enright et al., 2002),
the origin of mecA has long been searched for. Couto et al. (1996)
found a mecA homolog with 80% identity to the S. aureus gene
in S. sciuri, a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus of rodents,
and other primitive mammals. Another mecA homolog with 91%
identity with S. aureus mecA was found in staphylococci recovered
from horses, and speciﬁcally in S. vitulinus (Schnellmann et al.,
2006). According to recent data, S. ﬂeurettii, belonging to S. sciuri
group, could be the origin of mecA as this species contains mecA
and the chromosomal locus surrounding mecA that are almost
identical to the corresponding sequence of SCCmec (Tsubakishita
et al., 2010). Taken together, these studies indicate that animal
staphylococci are the likely origin and reservoir of mecA.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF MRSA
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus has long been considered the proto-
type of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens, causing infec-
tions in hospitals and healthcare facilities. The proportion of
MRSA infections has increased greatly in the last three decades and
strains deﬁned healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) have
become endemic in industrialized countries as causes of serious
infections such as septicemia, pneumonia, ventilator-associated
pneumonia, and surgical site infections (Diekema et al., 2001). In
the US, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System
(NNISS) reported that in 2003, over 60% of S. aureus isolates in
ICUs were MRSA (Klevens et al., 2006). In Europe according to
data collected by EARS-Net, the rate of MRSA in bloodstream
infections ranges from below 1% to over 50% in different coun-
tries, with lower rates in North European countries and a higher
rate in Mediterranean countries (Kock et al., 2010). At the end of
the 1990s, a new generation of MRSA appeared suddenly in a dif-
ferent setting, the community. The new MRSA strain, designated
community-acquired (CA)-MRSA, is able to cause infections in
young and otherwise healthy individuals, showing an unusual
virulence and capacity to spread (Deleo et al., 2010).

CA-MRSA commonly causes SSTIs with different severity
degrees, from mild (furuncles or impetigo), to serious infections
(necrotizing fasciitis; Miller et al., 2005), and rarely can cause a

severe form of pneumonia (necrotizing pneumonia) associated
with high mortality (Francis et al., 2005). CA-MRSA possesses
some distinctive features with regard to HA-MRSA: such as pres-
ence of SCCmec type IV or type V and rare multi-resistance (Naimi
et al., 2003). Characteristically, the large majority of CA-MRSA
harbors the genes for the Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a
toxin that is absent in HA-MRSA (Vandenesch et al., 2003). PVL
has been considered the principal virulence determinant (Lina
et al., 1999; Boyle-Vavra and Daum, 2007) or a simple marker of
CA-MRSA strains (Voyich et al., 2006). In the USA, the increase
in the prevalence of CA-MRSA took the shape of an epidemic,
largely due to the expansion of a single clone, designated USA300
(Moran et al., 2006; Kennedy et al., 2008; Tenover and Goering,
2009). In Europe, where the prevalence of CA-MRSA infections is
lower than in the USA (Del Giudice et al., 2006), the most common
clone is the European ST80 clone, (Urth et al., 2005), alongside a
variety of different CA-MRSA clones (Tristan et al., 2007; Sanchini
et al., 2011).

Recently, MRSA emerged as a frequent colonizer of animal pop-
ulations, possibly favored by the large antibiotic use in animals. In
food animals, primarily in pigs, a new MRSA strain with zoonotic
potential has been recognized and designated livestock-associated
(LA)-MRSA. The following chapters illustrate the association
between MRSA and animals and the implications for human
health.

STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AS AN ANIMAL-ADAPTED
PATHOGEN
The ability to colonize and produce infections in different hosts,
including humans, is an important characteristic of some S. aureus
lineages. In early studies, the available methods to type S. aureus
were exclusively phenotypic (phage typing, biotyping, and typing
of enzymes or toxins). Nevertheless, they allowed the differen-
tiation of S. aureus strains into host speciﬁc subsets or ecovars,
typically associated with man, poultry, sheep, goats, and cattle
(Devriese, 1984), while a minority of S. aureus strains belonged
to non-host speciﬁc types and were shared among different
hosts. The application of molecular biology techniques conﬁrmed
these early ﬁndings, revealing that particular genetic backgrounds
(clones or lineages) are associated with speciﬁc mammalian hosts
(Sung et al., 2008; Cuny et al., 2010). These studies also showed
that some lineages are not restricted and can be found to colonize
or cause infections in a broad variety of animal species, including
humans. One notable example is represented by ST398, originally
deﬁned the “pig” clone that has been recovered also from other
food animals and from humans (Voss et al., 2005; Witte et al.,
2007). Some primarily “human” clones are often found in ani-
mals: ST1, a frequent clone in human infections (Grundmann
et al., 2010) can cause bovine mastitis (Juhasz-Kaszanyitzky et al.,
2007) and is carried by pigs in Italy and other European countries
(European Food Safety Authority, 2009; Franco et al., 2011).

Staphylococcus aureus adapts speciﬁcally to different animal
hosts by genetically determined mechanisms that are just start-
ing to be understood. In some cases, host speciﬁcity is determined
by a selective afﬁnity of certain bacterial receptors to proteins of
the preferred host. S. aureus acquires iron, an essential bacter-
ial nutrient, from hemoglobin, following lysis of blood red cells

produced by S. aureus hemolysin. Hemoglobin is released and
bound to a surface S. aureus receptor, the iron surface determi-
nant B (IsdB), before being degraded. This receptor has a higher
afﬁnity for human hemoglobin than for the hemoglobin of other
mammals. This explains, at least in part, why S. aureus thrives in
the presence of human blood and why humans are generally the
preferential host for S. aureus (Pishchany et al., 2010).

Recent phylogenetic studies revealed that some animal S. aureus
lineages derived from human lineages. In this host-jump, S. aureus
underwent genetic adaptation losing virulence factors that were
useless in the new host and acquiring new characteristics. Some
examples are depicted in Table 1.

The poultry ST5 lineage which spread in poultry farms world-
wide (Lowder et al., 2009) has only recently diverged from the
human ST5 lineage. This host switch was associated with loss of
expression of several proteins that are relevant to human, but not
to avian pathogenesis, including the immune evasion cluster and
the staphylococcal protein A (SpA). SpA plays a major role in the
pathogenesis of human staphylococcal infections; among several
functions it binds the FC fragment of human IgG impairing anti-
body functions, but it does not bind the FC fragment of IgY, the
avian analog of IgG. On the other hand, poultry ST5 has acquired
novel mobile genetic elements that encode for advantageous traits
for survival in an avian host, including resistance to avian phago-
cytes killing. Similarly, the pathogenic lineage CC133 established in
small ruminants (sheep and goats) derived from human S. aureus
through a combination of allelic diversiﬁcation, gene decay, and
acquisition of mobile genetic elements (Guinane et al., 2010). In
particular, through horizontal gene transfer, this clone acquired

a pathogenicity island (SaPI) encoding a novel variant of the
von Willebrand factor-binding protein that has ruminant-speciﬁc
coagulase activity (Viana et al., 2010).

In line with these ﬁndings, a microarray study (Sung et al.,
2008) revealed differences in the frequency of speciﬁc genes car-
ried by animal S. aureus and those carried by human isolates. In
animal isolates, there was a low prevalence of a cluster of genes
encoding proteins relevant for host immune evasion that target
speciﬁcally human immune responses (van Wamel et al., 2006).
One such gene is sak, coding for staphylokinase, a ﬁbrin-speciﬁc
plasminogen activator that is present in over 80% of human iso-
lates, but is absent from some cattle and pig lineages (Monecke
et al., 2007; Sung et al., 2008; Franco et al., 2011).

MRSA IN COMPANION ANIMALS
In industrialized countries, companion animals have become an
integral part of the household. More than 50% of households in
the USA have pets and 25% of households in the United King-
dom have dogs (Chomel and Sun, 2011). In general, MRSA strains
recovered from companion animals (cats, dogs, or horses) are dif-
ferent from those recovered from food animals. In the ﬁrst case
strains are usually similar to human HA-MRSA, while in the sec-
ond case they appear to belong to speciﬁc animal-adapted clones,
unrelated to the most common HA-MRSA (Table 2).

Other staphylococcal species that share with S. aureus the abil-
ity to acquire methicillin resistance, speciﬁcally S. intermedius,
S. pseudintermedius, and S. schleiferi, are more common in pets
(Hanselman et al., 2008, 2009). Reports of MRSA isolated from
pets were sporadic until the late 1990s and were mostly related to

clinical infections. In addition, before the identiﬁcation of S. inter-
medius and S. pseudintermedius, some misclassiﬁcation may have
occurred (Devriese et al., 2005). The emergence of CA-MRSA in
the last decade and the importance of tracing antibiotic-resistant
organisms also in the community, have prompted many studies
on MRSA in pets and its possible transmission to pet owners.

According to studies performed in various countries, especially
in the UK and Australia, MRSA colonization is rare in healthy
pets. No MRSA was found in healthy cats in several studies (Bap-
tiste et al., 2005; Loefﬂer et al., 2005; Hanselman et al., 2009),
although in a recent study 2.1% of cats presented to veterinary
clinics in Greater London area were colonized by MRSA (Loefﬂer
et al., 2011). In dogs in a household or at admission to a veteri-
nary hospital, colonization rates varied from 0 to 2.1% (Bagcigil
et al., 2007; Boost et al., 2008; Hanselman et al., 2008, 2009; Loef-
ﬂer et al., 2011). In some particular settings, e.g., dogs in a rescue
shelter (Loefﬂer et al., 2010) or in a veterinary hospital (Loefﬂer
et al., 2005), a high MRSA colonization rate, up to 9%, was found.
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections in pets are mainly rep-
resented by skin and soft tissue infections and are sometimes
associated with veterinary surgeries. In a large study in the UK,
MRSA was recovered from 1.5% of samples from infected animals
(Rich and Roberts, 2004). In several studies, dogs appear to have
more MRSA infections than cats (Morgan, 2008), but as there are
no direct comparative studies, any implication of different suscep-
tibility to MRSA infections between these animal species should
be veriﬁed. The MRSA types recovered from cats and dogs are
similar to those affecting humans, with a similar regional distrib-
ution (Table 2). For instance, in the USA the most common MRSA
type in pets is the clone identiﬁed as USA100 (ST5), which is also
the most common HA-MRSA clone in humans (McDougal et al.,
2003). In the United Kingdom the most common clones are those

identiﬁed as EMRSA-15 (ST22) and EMRSA-16 (ST36) that are
prevalent in UK hospitals (Ellington et al., 2010). Recently, dogs
have been found to be colonized by the livestock-associated (LA)-
MRSA clone characteristic of food animals and identiﬁed as ST398
(Loefﬂer et al., 2009).

Horses are colonized by MRSA in a percentage ranging from
0 to 11% (Vengust et al., 2006; Bagcigil et al., 2007; Loefﬂer et al.,
2011). In a large study of colonization in Canada involving over
2,000 horses, 2.7% were found to be colonized by MRSA, mainly
intranasally (Weese et al., 2005) while studies performed at equine
hospitals showed a higher rate (Baptiste et al., 2005). Sporadic
cases and outbreak of MRSA infections in horses were reported
in large establishments or post-operatively in veterinary hospitals
(Weese et al., 2005; Morgan, 2008).

Horses, differently from pets, are colonized or infected by
MRSA types quite different from the lineages predominant in
humans in the corresponding areas (Loefﬂer and Lloyd, 2010).
Horse MRSA commonly belong to ST8 and related STs within
clonal complex (CC) 8. A typical horse clone is USA500 (Morgan,
2008), that emerged as an HA-MRSA clone in the USA but is now
infrequently recovered in human patients (McDougal et al., 2003).
More recently, studies from Europe and Canada reported horses
to be colonized by LA-MRSA ST398 (Cuny et al., 2008; Tokateloff
et al., 2009; Table 2).

TRANSMISSION OF MRSA BETWEEN HUMANS AND COMPANION
ANIMALS
Transmission of bacterial strains between companion animals and
their owners has been demonstrated in several instances. Molec-
ular analyses have shown the presence of indistinguishable MRSA
strains in pets and humans living in the same household, and have
suggested, but not deﬁnitely proved, the direction of transmission

MRSA: from animals to humans

(Weese, 2010). As the isolates from cats and dogs resemble nosoco-
mial MRSA, it is usually assumed that companion animals acquire
MRSA from humans. Both humans and animals are more often
colonized than infected and both can act as reservoirs of MRSA
for recirculation of strains inside the household (Morgan, 2008).
According to a study performed in Canada and in the US, the own-
ers of companion animals have a MRSA colonization rate (18%)
signiﬁcantly higher than the general population (1–2%) although
they do not appear to be at an increased risk for MRSA infec-
tions (Faires et al., 2009). In a nursing home for the elderly in UK
patients, staff, and the resident cat were all colonized by the same
MRSA strain. The cat harbored the MRSA strain on the fur and
paws and was the most probable vehicle of MRSA transmission in
the nursing home (Scott et al., 1988). In a veterinary hospital the
transmission of an EMRSA-15 (ST22) strain from infected dogs to
staff members has been demonstrated by molecular typing meth-
ods (Baptiste et al., 2005). Pets can be also colonized by CA-MRSA,
as the spread of a PVL-positive CA-MRSA strain in a household
in the Netherlands was shown to involve also the family dog (van
Duijkeren et al., 2005).

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus transmission from horses to
humans (and sometimes vice-versa) is also well documented, espe-
cially with regard to professionals caring for infected animals in
veterinary hospitals. Staff caring for an MRSA-infected foal expe-
rienced skin infections due to the characteristic equine strain
USA500, the same carried by the foal (Weese et al., 2006).

MRSA IN FOOD ANIMALS: LA-MRSA ST398
In 2004, a baby and her parents who lived on a pig farm in the
Netherlands were unexpectedly found to be colonized by MRSA.
Other pig farmers and their close contacts, as well as one pig were
found colonized (Voss et al., 2005). The colonization rate in pig
farmers was found to be 23%, a ﬁgure 100 times higher than the
normal colonization rate in the Netherlands. All MRSA isolates
were found to share similar characteristics, such as non-typeability
by PFGE and identical spa type. Similar ﬁndings in pigs and pig
farmers were reported from France (Armand-Lefevre et al., 2005).
The “pig MRSA” was found to belong to a unique MRSA clone,
ST398, and to a group of related spa types.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that the presence of the “pig
MRSA” in the Netherlands and France was not an exceptional
occurrence, as this clone was recovered from pigs in several Euro-
pean countries (Guardabassi et al., 2007; Vanderhaeghen et al.,
2010b). In addition, MRSA ST398 was shown to colonize other
species of livestock besides swine (Table 2); it was thus more
appropriately designated LA-MRSA. The reported carriage rates
of LA-MRSA ST398 in pigs varied according to the geographical
area and the type of study: from 1% in Denmark (Guardabassi
et al., 2007), to 40% in Belgium and the Netherlands (de Neeling
et al., 2007; Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010b).

In a study funded by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA),
conducted in 2008, 24 European countries were involved in an
active survey of MRSA in the dust of the environment of pig hold-
ings as an indication of pig colonization. Overall, MRSA were
found in pig holdings of 17 countries, with a prevalence varying
between countries from 1 to 50% of the holdings sampled. Gen-
erally, countries with a higher density of pig farming were also

countries with a higher recovery rate of MRSA (European Food
Safety Authority, 2009). In this survey, spa types related to ST398
were, as expected, largely dominant; however, different clones, such
as ST1, ST9, and ST97, were also found associated with pig carriage,
although at a much lower frequency (Figure 1).

The presence of LA-MRSA ST398 in pigs is not exclusive to
Europe, as a high rate of ST398 colonization was also found in
pigs in Canada (Khanna et al., 2008) and in the US (Smith et al.,
2009).

Other MRSA clones besides ST398 have been found to colonize
pigs, generally with a regional distribution (Table 2). Studies per-
formed in China reported the presence of ST9 colonizing pigs
and workers (Wagenaar et al., 2009). In other areas, common
human clones were identiﬁed in pigs, such as USA100 (ST5) in
Canada (Khanna et al., 2008) and recently, ST22 in Ireland (Hor-
gan et al., 2011). In Italy, pigs at the slaughterhouse were found to
be colonized by different clones of MRSA besides ST398, including
t127/ST1, ST9, and ST97 (Battisti et al., 2010). ST1 is a common
human clone, although it is frequently recovered in Italian hos-
pitals in recent years (Monaco et al., 2010). It is possible that
the recovery of human clones in pigs represents human-to-pig
contamination, but it is also possible that some strains, such as
the t127/ST1 clone are in fact animal-adapted strains of ancient
human origin.

Despite the high rate of colonization in pigs, LA-MRSA ST398
has only sporadically been reported to cause clinical infections
in this animal species (Weese, 2010): in pigs infections are rarely
caused by S. aureus, the most common staphylococcal pathogen
being S. hyicus.

The contamination of food products by animal MRSA is a big
threat, as it has a potential for wide dissemination in the general
population (Kluytmans, 2010). A study performed in the Nether-
lands found that 11% of raw meat samples from the retail market
(including pork, beef, veal, lamb, and chicken) was contaminated
by MRSA, represented mainly by MRSA ST398 (de Boer et al.,
2009). A study from South Italy reported the presence of MRSA of
spa types corresponding to ST398 in mozzarella cheese products
(Crisetti et al., 2011).

LA-MRSA ST398 has been isolated not only from pigs, but
also from other animal species, as already mentioned, including
dogs, horses, calves, and poultry (Cuny et al., 2008; Hasman et al.,
2010; Huber et al., 2010; Loefﬂer and Lloyd, 2010). In a study from
Belgium, 12% of the isolates obtained in 2006 from healthy chick-
ens were MRSA that belonged to spa types associated with ST398
(Nemati et al., 2008; Table 2).

MICROBIOLOGICAL, MOLECULAR, AND VIRULENCE CHARACTERISTICS
OF LA-MRSA ST398
LA-MRSA strains were initially distinguished by their peculiar
resistance to digestion by SmaI, the restriction enzyme most fre-
quently used for PFGE typing of S. aureus (Chung et al., 2000),
due to the presence of a new methylation enzyme protecting
restriction sites (Bens et al., 2006). Otherwise, LA-MRSA were per-
fectly typeable by current molecular methods: they were associated
with a speciﬁc group of spa types with related repeat sequences,
including t011, t034, t108, and t899 (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010b;
Figure 1) and belonged to ST398, a clone historically quite rare

in humans that did not derive from the most common MRSA
lineages. Characteristically, LA-MRSA ST398 strains carry SCCmec
type type IV or, more frequently, type V (Monecke et al., 2011). The
presence of these SCCmec types in LA-MRSA is shared with CA-
MRSA and suggests a transmission of genetic elements between
these two MRSA groups. However, differently from CA-MRSA,
ST398 generally does not possess the phage-encoded PVL-genes,
that contribute to the virulence of the former. Exceptions involve
strains of human infections that may have acquired PVL-genes
from human MRSA: one patient from the Netherlands and two

patients from Sweden had infections associated with PVL-positive
ST398 (van Belkum et al., 2008; Welinder-Olsson et al., 2008). Also
sporadic ST398 MRSA from China has been found to be PVL-
positive (Yu et al., 2008; Stegger et al., 2010). No speciﬁc virulence
factor characteristic of ST398 has been identiﬁed so far (Monecke
et al., 2011).

LA-MRSA ST398 is generally susceptible to antibiotics other
than beta-lactams, but it is characteristically resistant to tetracy-
cline, which suggests that heavy tetracycline use in the pig industry
may have favored the emergence of this clone. A recent study

showed that the addition of tetracycline or zinc in animal feed
increased the number of ST398 bacterial cells in pigs’ nostrils
although it had no effect on MRSA transmission (Moodley et al.,
2011). LA-MRSA ST398 strains have been found to carry previ-
ously unidentiﬁed resistance genes, such as a novel trimethoprim
resistance gene, dfrK, (Kadlec and Schwarz, 2010) and a novel
gene, vga(C), encoding an ABC efﬂux pumps and conferring resis-
tance to streptogramins and lincosamides (Kadlec and Schwarz,
2009). In addition, an isolate from the nose of a pig was found to
carry the multidrug resistance gene cfr (Kehrenberg et al., 2009)
that is able to confer resistance to ﬁve different antibiotic classes,
including linezolid, a “last-resource” antibiotic for serious infec-
tions due to multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Due to
their characteristic multi-host speciﬁcity, ST398 strains can rep-
resent an efﬁcient vehicle of these resistant determinants that are
plasmid-encoded, favoring their transmission and spread.

LA-MRSA ST398 CARRIAGE AND INFECTIONS IN HUMANS
Before the “epidemic” of pig colonization, ST398 isolates were
rarely reported from human colonization or infection. After the
ﬁrst report from the Netherlands, many studies from Europe and
other areas indicated that living or working on a farm was a risk
factor for acquiring MRSA (Table 3). A case-control study per-
formed in the Netherlands showed that carriers of non-typeable
MRSA were more often pig or cattle farmers and that the den-
sity of non-typeable MRSA isolates corresponded to the density
of pig farming (van Loo et al., 2007). In Belgium 37.8% of pig
farmers were found colonized by ST398 (Denis et al., 2009); in
Germany 86% of pig farmers and 45% of veterinarians caring for
pigs were colonized (Cuny et al., 2009). Family members that were
not directly exposed to pigs were colonized in a lower percentage
(Cuny et al., 2009), indicating that inter-human transmission can
occur but at low frequency. Veterinarians and other attendees of

an international conference on pig health in Denmark were sam-
pled for MRSA carriage and 12.5% were found to carry MRSA that
mostly belonged to spa types corresponding to ST398 (Wulf et al.,
2008a).

In Ontario (Canada), 20% of pig farmers were colonized by
MRSA and a correlation was noted between the presence of MRSA
in pigs and humans on farms (Khanna et al., 2008).

Infection can follow colonization and LA-MRSA ST398 has
been found to be associated with human infections (Krziwanek
et al., 2009), including serious forms such as deep abscesses, cel-
lulitis, necrotizing fasciitis (Pan et al., 2009; Soavi et al., 2010),
and bacteremia (van der Mee-Marquet et al., 2011). A survey
carried out in 17 European countries in 2007 on the preva-
lence of ST398 among MRSA isolates from human infections,
revealed that the highest proportion of ST398 was found in the
Netherlands and in Belgium, while in the other countries the
proportion was <2% (van Cleef et al., 2011; Table 3). A small
hospital outbreak due to ST398 occurred in Denmark in 2007
(Wulf et al., 2008a), indicating that this clone is capable of inter-
human spread outside the farming setting, although this phe-
nomenon is currently limited. In a recent study, 25% of patients
admitted to a University Hospital in 2008–2009 in a German
region with high a density of pig farming carried MRSA of spa
types associated with ST398 and a number of clinical infections
due to this clone were detected (Kock et al., 2011). According
to a Dutch study, ST398 seems to be less transmittable inside
hospitals than non-ST398 MRSA (Wassenberg et al., 2011). It
could be speculated that the scarce propensity of LA-MRSA to
spread in hospitals may be due to its susceptibility to antibiotics
other than beta-lactams compared to typical HA-MRSA. How-
ever, the possibility that LA-MRSA may acquire other resistant
traits and pose a greater risk to the human population cannot be
dismissed.

MRSA: from animals to humans

MRSA IN BOVINE MASTITIS
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important bacterial
pathogens in bovine mastitis, a disease that causes signiﬁcant
economical losses in the milk industry; thus, S. aureus in gen-
eral and MRSA in particular have been the focus of several studies
in dairy cattle. The ﬁrst report of MRSA in bovine mastitis milk
comes from Belgium where in 1972 Devriese and Hommez iso-
lated strains that, using biotyping methods, appeared to be of
human origin (Devriese and Hommez, 1975). After this report,
and until recently, MRSA was only sporadically isolated from cow
milk. In the Republic of Korea a small proportion (0.4%) of MRSA
was found among 3047 bacterial isolates from bovine mastitis milk
samples obtained between 1997 and 2004 (Moon et al., 2007).
In Switzerland MRSA were found in 1.4% of mastitis milk sam-
ples (Huber et al., 2010) and in Hungary MRSA characterized by
spa type t127 and ST1, of likely human origin, was recovered in
4% of samples from cows with subclinical mastitis. In this last
study, transmission of MRSA to a farmer working in close contact
with bovines was also demonstrated (Juhasz-Kaszanyitzky et al.,
2007). A study from Japan examined 363 S. aureus from bovine
milk: of these, only four were MRSA, all belonging to CC5 (Hata
et al., 2010). In Belgium MRSA was found in nearly 10% of the
farms where S. aureus mastitis was present. This comparatively
high prevalence was associated with the ﬁnding that all isolates
were LA-MRSA ST398 (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010a; Table 2).

Few studies dealt with colonization of healthy cattle: a study
from Switzerland only found MRSA in 1% of nasal swabs from
calves and in 0.25% of nasal swabs from cattle (Huber et al., 2010).
In this study the MRSA isolates from calves were ST398, providing
evidence that LA-MRSA ST398 can colonize also cattle, although
the colonization rate is much lower than in pigs (Table 2).

A NEW mecA GENE IN BOVINE ISOLATES
A recently published article (Garcia-Alvarez et al., 2011) reported
the presence of MRSA strains with unusual features in bovine milk
samples from the UK. These strains belonged mainly to CC130
(more rarely to CC425) and carried a novel mecA gene that was
only 70% identical at the nucleotide level to the classical mecA gene,
escaping detection by routine PCR assays. Similarly, the encoded
PBP2a protein was only 63% identical to the classical PBP2a pro-
tein and could not be detected by the commercially available
antibody-based assays. The novel mecA was named mecALGA251,
after the designation of the bovine strain where it was identiﬁed
for the ﬁrst time. In turn mecALGA251 was part of a novel SCCmec
element, identiﬁed as type XI. Other distinguished features of the
SCCmec type XI are the presence of a mec complex that has a dif-
ferent organization from other SCCmec elements including also
the beta-lactamase resistance gene blaZ, and the presence of an
arsenic resistance operon.

Although previously CC130 had been associated only with
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus from animals, isolates with the
same novel mecALGA251 were recovered from human clinical infec-
tions in the UK and Denmark. The ability of these strains to
cause infections in humans was conﬁrmed by a concurrent report
describing two patients infected with similar strains in Ireland
(Shore et al., 2011) and by another study from Germany where

11 CC130 strains carrying SCCmec type XI and mecALGA251
were identiﬁed out of a collection of 12,691 MRSA obtained in
2006–2011 (Cuny et al., 2011).

It is possible that these strains had been circulating for some
time among cattle: for instance in 2003 a report from Korea
described some MRSA strains from dairy cattle with low-level
resistance to oxacillin that were mecA-negative (Lee, 2003). Stud-
ies to investigate these ﬁndings further were not performed, but it
is plausible to speculate that these strains carried the mecALGA251
gene or a similar variant.

The strains with the novel mecA are a new example of LA-
MRSA. At the moment they do not seem to pose a great risk, but
their evolution is unpredictable: they could become better able to
colonize, more resistant, or more pathogenic (Fluit, 2011). Con-
tinuous surveillance is necessary to promptly detect new types
of MRSA from animals and to evaluate their impact on human
health.

CONCLUSION
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus made its ﬁrst appearance as the
resistant variant of S. aureus 50 years ago and has since estab-
lished as a typical multi-resistant nosocomial pathogen (Jevons,
1961). In the last two decades, new generations of MRSA have
emerged, with the distinctive ability to occupy new niches, specif-
ically the human community and food-producing animals. The
risk of the presence of MRSA in food animals is clearly associated
with the transfer of these microorganisms to humans. If these new
MRSA enter hospitals, they will ﬁnd frail patients who will be easily
infected.

Phylogenetic studies revealed that some lineages of animal-
adapted staphylococci originated from human strains following
profound genetic modiﬁcations, and that today these animal-
adapted strains can be transmitted back to humans. Both wild
and food animals are in contact with the large microbiome and
resistome pools of the environment and can therefore carry new
strains and become their vehicle to the human community. Differ-
ent staphylococcal species present in animals and the environment
represent a large reservoir of resistance genes, from which MRSA
has already picked not only the mec gene, but also other resistance
determinants. The new MRSA from animals may be able to con-
vey to humans novel resistant determinants and novel virulence
factors.

While in hospitals the proportion of MRSA is clearly associ-
ated with patterns of high antibiotic consumption, it is unclear if
the emergence of animal strains has been driven by high or inap-
propriate antibiotic consumption in the animal farming setting.
However, the control of antibiotic use appears to be one of the
few possible interventions today to reduce the spread and trans-
mission of MRSA. As for MRSA colonizing food animals, good
farming practices also appear to be essential in the control of the
spread of MRSA.
