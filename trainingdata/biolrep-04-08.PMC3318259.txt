Abstract
Recent advances in sequencing technologies have uncovered a world of RNAs that do not code for
proteins, known as non-protein coding RNAs, that play important roles in gene regulation. Along with
histone modifications and transcription factors, non-coding RNA is part of a layer of transcriptional
control on top of the DNA code. This layer of components and their interactions specifically enables (or
disables) the modulation of three-dimensional folding of chromatin to create a context for transcriptional
regulation that underlies cell-specific transcription. In this perspective, we propose a structural and
functional hierarchy, in which the DNA code, proteins and non-coding RNAs act as context creators to
fold chromosomes and regulate genes.

Introduction
Transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes has classi-
cally been viewed as the interaction of elements in the
immediate vicinity of the transcription start site (promo-
ters) with upstream elements (enhancers) [1,2]. Mutations
in conserved upstream promoter DNA sequences affect
gene expression directly [3,4]. However, transcriptional
regulation is not only determined by DNA sequence but
involves additional layers of control that include nucleo-
some positioning, DNA binding regulatory proteins such
as transcription factors, histone modifications and
non-coding RNA [5-7]. Moreover, the development of
high throughput chromosome conformation capture
techniques [8] has shown that the three-dimensional
organization of genes and upstream elements affects
transcriptional activity [9-11]. Here, we present how the
combination of these factors can provide a “context” for
the regulation of gene expression.

from complete. At the basis of transcription lies the DNA
code that directly determines the composition and
location of DNA elements and provides specific recogni-
tion sites for DNA binding proteins. The binding of
transcription factors and recruitment of complexes that
modify histones create an environment that allows for
element interaction and initiation of gene transcription.
However, predicting the location of promoters and
enhancers based solely on histone modifications and
transcription factor binding relies on complicated mod-
els that are still suboptimal [12-14]. Moreover, recent
findings on the involvement of non-coding RNA in
transcriptional regulation further imply a more compli-
cated reality [15,16]. Is there a combination of histone
modifications which is sufficient to predict the position
of regulatory elements? Are specific non-coding RNA
transcripts involved in recruiting proteins to regulatory
elements?

Putting the genome into context
The concept of context
Gene expression regulation in eukaryotes includes
interactions between promoters and enhancers, but our
understanding of
the mechanisms that drive these
interactions, or that determine their specificity, is far

It is now highly debated whether chromatin modifications
comprise a “code” similar to DNA (reviewed by Henikoff
and Shilatifard [17]). The crosstalk between histones,
transcription factors and non-coding RNA suggest that
they interact
to form a highly interwoven level of
organization [16]. In the context model, transcriptional

regulation is subdivided into three levels of interactions:
the DNA level, the local chromatin level, and the three-
dimensional folding of the genome. The first level, the
DNA code, forms an interaction platform by providing
protein binding sites for transcription factors that, together
with non-coding RNAs and histone modifications, form
the next layer of gene regulation. This layer of interactions
enables specific long-range interactions that result in a
three-dimensional folding of the chromatin. This higher
order organization provides transcriptional context that
can either facilitate or block the initiation of transcription
(Figure 1). Importantly, changes at any level are not
necessarily unidirectional. Compaction of higher order
structures, for example, will influence the accessibility of
DNA and binding of transcription factors, providing a
likely feedback mechanism. Below we describe each of the
layers of context in more detail.

Level 1: the DNA code
The binding of (core) transcription factors critically
depends on the recognition of specific DNA sequences,
known as DNA motifs. High throughput techniques,

Figure 1. The context model

(a) The context model of gene expression consists of three layers of
regulation, each representing a level of interactions that allows the
transition from code to context. (b) DNA, the first layer, interacts with
non-coding RNA (arbitrary sequence in blue), TFs (green) and histone
modifications (red). The third layer is the resulting 3D folding (dotted line),
which creates the final context for gene transcription. Abbreviations:
ncRNA, non-coding RNA; TF, transcription factor; 3D, three-dimensional.

such as ChIP-seq and enhanced yeast one-hybrid, which
visualizes the interaction of a transcription factor with a
bait DNA sequence, are now employed to uncover
transcription factor-DNA and DNA-transcription factor
interactions, respectively [18,19]. Such studies show that
transcription factor-binding events are abundant and can
occur at large genomic distances from genes. Similarly,
conserved non-coding sequences can be found through-
out the genome. Their conservation implies that they
have an important function – they may affect the binding
affinity of factors, or encode non-coding RNAs [20,21].
Interestingly, deletion of these sequences with unknown
function can influence gene expression of genes located
hundreds of Kb away, implying that long-range looping
of DNA brings the sequences into contact with the genes
they regulate [22].

Level 2: context creators
This level of interactions involves histone positioning
and modifications, repertoires of transcription factors
and non-coding RNA and the interplay between them.
This level
is perhaps the most complex, and it has
become the center of attention in recent years.

Although nucleosome positioning, histone modifications,
non-coding RNA and transcription factor binding are
useful descriptors for genomic elements, they do not seem
to define regulatory elements by themselves [17]. Histone
modifications have been used to classify upstream regions
as promoters (i.e. H3K4me3) and enhancers (i.e.
H3K4me1, H3K27ac) [13], but this may not reflect the
complete picture. Recent developments in DNA sequen-
cing have led to the appreciation of the importance of non-
coding RNA as a regulatory component in the genome
[15,23,24]. Although the extent of non-coding RNA
involvement
is still debated [25], more and more
examples of the involvement of non-coding RNA in
transcriptional regulation appear in the current literature.
Both long and short non-coding RNAs have been
identified at regulatory elements [26,27]. Their function
is still mostly unknown, and their nomenclature is purely
descriptive, based on their site of occurrence (e.g. PASR for
Promoter-Associated Short RNA or eRNA for enhancer-
RNA) [23,28]. It is possible that non-coding RNA can act
as a fast and flexible intermediate to recruit histone-
modifying complexes to DNA elements [29-32]. Several
reports on long non-coding RNA have shown their
involvement in chromatin remodeling, affecting differ-
entiation and disease [33] (reviewed by Huarte and Rinn
[34] and Hung and Chang [35]). Long non-coding RNAs
have also been found to be involved in transcriptional
repression via polycomb proteins, which are known to
maintain cell
identity by repressing developmental
regulators in certain cell types [15,16,31]. Although long

http://f1000.com/reports/b/4/8

non-coding RNA are now widely studied, small non-coding
RNA and antisense RNA have also been implicated in
polycomb-mediated transcriptional gene silencing [36-38].
The combinatorial complexity at this level of chromatin
regulation and structure is further modulated by feedback
and feedforward signals between histone modifications,
non-coding RNA and transcription factors.

Level 3: context
The three-dimensional
folding of DNA is the final
context that allows for gene transcription to initiate.
The folding of DNA into higher order structures is not a
random event, and it has long been thought to affect
gene transcription [39-42]. At the nuclear level, chromo-
somes occupy specific nuclear territories (reviewed by
Cremer and Cremer [43]). Chromatin interactions
within and between broad zones of chromosomes lead
to nuclear compartments where active genes tend to
co-locate, near the center of the nucleus, and inactive
genes cluster near the nuclear periphery. This indicates a
strong correlation, though not necessarily causation,
between nuclear positioning and gene activity (reviewed
by Geyer et al. [44]). At the finest scale, precise DNA
folding or “looping” interactions between gene promo-
ters and their distal regulatory elements can be found.
DNA looping (level 3) is guided by long-range interac-
tions between DNA sequence elements (level 1), which
can be mediated by interacting context creators (level 2).
An illustration of the interplay between multiple levels of
regulation that leads to a context for gene expression can
be found in the regulation of the HOXA locus. Here,
chromosomal
looping brings the non-coding RNA
HOTTIP in close proximity to HOXA genes. HOTTIP
recruits the histone 3 lysine 4 modifying complex MLL
by binding to WDR5, targeting this complex to the
HOXA locus. As a result, HOTTIP controls HOXA gene
expression by bridging higher-order chromosomal loop-
ing and chromatin modifications [26]. This exemplifies
how context provides an environment for communica-
tion between regulatory elements in three-dimensional
space, leading to either activation or repression of gene
transcription.

Summary
Recent
technical advances in DNA sequencing have
enabled genome-wide analysis at each of the three levels:
(1) genome sequencing to identify conserved regulatory
elements; (2) ChIP-seq [45], DeepCAGE [46], RNA-seq
[47], NET-seq [48], ChiRP [49] and CHART [50] to
identify chromatin modification,
transcription factor
binding and (non-coding) RNA expression and localiza-
tion; and (3) 3C combined with deep sequencing (e.g.
Hi-C and 3-seq) [8,51,52] to probe three-dimensional
folding of the genome. Combined, these tools allow an

integrated systems approach towards a more complete
understanding of the context in which the genome is
regulated.
