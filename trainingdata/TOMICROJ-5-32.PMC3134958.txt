Abstract:  Objective:  This  is  the  new  comparative  geogenetic  molecular  evolution  research  of  M.  tuberculosis  in  Iran  
and  Belarus.  Thus,  we  researched  the  genetic  patterns  of  samples  collected  in  the  first  survey  of  anti-tuberculosis  
drug-resistance by gene coding of RNA polymerase as part of the international project of on tuberculosis. 

Method: DNA extraction and amplification of rpoB gene was performed. All PCR products of gene were sequenced using 
the  Amersham  auto  sequencer.  For  analysing  phenogram  has  been  demonstrated  by  method  UPGMA  and  Neighbour-
Joining. Clinical  isolates (70/473) were  analyzed by using sequencing gene rpoB and genotyped by program DNAMAN 
and MEGA. 

Results: The all data were compared with the international database of national center for biotechnology information web-
site. Multi drug resistant of tuberculosis patient (MDR-TB) was 92% in never treated and 8% in previously treated. Muta-
tions in  rpoB gene  and katG genes were showed  in 95% and 84% of the  MDR isolates, respectively. Two  clusters were 
found  to  be  identical  by  the  four  different  analysis  methods,  presumably  representing  cases  of  recent  transmission  of 
MDR tuberculosis. The other  isolates  are divided in  Iran into 2 groups: group A – similar to  the Eastern  strains  (China, 
Taiwan) and group B – strains of another genotype. And 3 groups in Belarus: group A - Strains of the first group are more 
similar to the standard European and Eastern ones China and Taiwan) which diverged in the last 10 years (Genetic evolu-
tion rate), i.e. they are relatively new ones, and that is confirmed by the mutations, group B - Strains of the second group 
diverged earlier; they are older than the strains of the first group (16 years old- time and rate of evolution) and group C - 
Strains of the third group are similar to European strains and only circulate in Brest  region. They are grouped separately 
on  the  phenogram  and  became  prevalent  in  Iran  (they  are  called  Iranian  residential  strains  and  also  is  genetic  analogy  
between group A from Iran and Belarusian isolates. 

Conclusion:  This  research  gives  a  first  result  on  genetic  evolution  of  the  M.  tuberculosis  strains  distributing  in  the  Iran 
and  Belarus  during  the  first  survey  of  anti-tuberculosis  drug-resistance  and  is  homologies  between  groups  A  from  Iran 
with  group  A  from  Belarus.  It  may  aid  in  the  creation  of  a  national  database  that  will  be  a  valuable  support  for  further 
studies.

INTRODUCTION 

  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  has  caused  tuberculosis 
(TB) in humans for thousands of years [1, 2], and the World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  estimates  that  one  third  of  the 
global  population  is  infected  with M.  tuberculosis  [3];  how-
ever,  the  bacterium  has  remained  an  enigma.  The  global  re-
surgence  of  TB  highlights  the  need  for  an  improved  under-
standing  of  its  epidemiology  and  its  evolutionary  biologic 
features.  Recent  advances  in  molecular  characterization  of 
M.  tuberculosis  isolates,  which  index  variation  in  insertion 
sequences  [4]  and  repetitive  genomic  elements  [5,  6];  have 
elucidated  clusters  of  identical  and  closely  related  strain 
families  [7-10].  These  findings  have  provided  insights  into 
regional [11] and national [12] epidemiologic features. How-
ever,  these  techniques  may  be  less  suited  to  global  popula-
tion  and  evolutionary  analyses,  and  integrating  information 
obtained  from  different  approaches  is  complex  [4,  13].  Ge-
nomic  comparisons  have  identified  genetic  variation  for 
population screening; however, these analyses  are  limited  to 
those sites that vary between the compared genomes and are 
potentially  misleading  [2,  3,  14-16].  Nucleotide  sequences 
provide  robust,  portable,  and  comparable  data  for  studying 
population variation. The mutational processes that generate 
this  variation  are  understood,  and  sequence  data  have  been 
successfully  used  in  the  study  of  bacterial  epidemiology, 
population  biology,  and  evolution  [17].  The  complete  ge-
nome sequences (16–19) provide access to all regions of the 
chromosome  and  facilitate  such  studies.  However,  high-
throughput gene sequencing of structural genes [20] and host 
immune  system  protein  targets  (21)  in  M.  tuberculosis  iso-
lates indicated low levels of sequence diversity. In M. tuber-
culosis, resistance to drugs (rifampicin and Isoniazid) occurs 
because  of  chromosomal  in  certain  genes  that  reported  by 
investigators in the katG and rpoB gene [21-23].  

  Although  extensive  genomic  sequencing  was  performed 
in  both  studies,  comparable  sequence  data  were  obtained  on 
a limited number of highly selected isolates.  

  Ongoing  research  is  focused  on  identifying  the  factors 
responsible  for  the  worldwide  spread  of  the  W-Beijing 
strains  and  their  ability  to  adapt  and  enhance  their  pathoge-
nisity  or  virulence.  Identifying  a  possible  mechanism  for 
increased  adaptation  of  these  bacteria  to  the  human  immu-
nologic  host  defense  system  or  human  interventions  such  as 
anti-TB treatment  is of the utmost  importance. Such  mecha-
nisms  may  indicate  how  the  bacterium  adapts  to  the  host,  a 
prerequisite  for  an  enhanced  accumulation  of  chromosomal 
associated with resistance. 

  Despite  an  unusually  high  degree  of  relatedness  at  the 
genetic level, the five species comprising the M. tuberculosis 
complex differ in their host range, their phenotypes and abil-
ity  to  cause  disease  in  humans.  Variations  in  virulence  are 
even  observed,  in  animal  models  of  the  disease,  between 
members  of  the  M.  tuberculosis  species.  Comparative  ge-
nomics  has  been  applied  to  the  M.  tuberculosis  complex  in 
an attempt to understand the molecular basis for these differ-
ences.  

  The  genome  sequences  of  the  paradigm  strain,  H37Rv, 
and  a  recent  clinical  isolate,  CDC1551,  comprise  4.41  and 
4.40  Mb,  respectively,  and  harbour  ~4,000  genes  coding  for 

proteins.  In  contrast,  the  genome  of  M.  bovis  strain 
AF2122/97  at  4.34  Mb  is  significantly  smaller  as  the  result 
of a series of deletion events that have removed ~80 genes.  

  The  genetic  evolution  characterization  of  the  isolates 
selected during this study was not carried out and there is no 
information on the major distributing clades of M. tuberculo-
sis.  The  change  of  nucleotide  involved  in  antibiotic  resis-
tance  and  the  question  of  whether  the  Beijing  family  of  the 
M.  tuberculosis complex had spread  into Iran have not been 
studied  until  now  and  were  not  comparative  between  Euro-
pean country and Asian Country. Molecular epidemiological 
studies have demonstrated the widespread of this family and 
its association with drug-resistance [6, 7, 9]. 

 
In  recent  years,  the  genetic  typing  of  M.  tuberculosis 
complex  (MTC)  strains  has  been  widely  used  to  support 
conventional epidemiological investigations of TB outbreaks 
and as a tool for studying transmission dynamics.  

 
In  this  work,  has  been  investigated  the  genetic  evolution 
of  isolates  selected  in  the  first  survey  of  anti-tuberculosis 
antibiotic-resistance  by  analyses  rpoB  fragment  sequence  in 
the  MDR strains from  Belarus  and Iran and has been  identi-
fied  homologies  between  groups  A  from  Iran  with  group  A 
from Belarus. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Mycobacterial Strains 

  A total of 895 M. tuberculosis strains were isolated from 
the sputa of patients with active pulmonary  tuberculosis and 
collected  from  the  different  region  of  Iran  and  Belarus  that 
70  isolates  were  recovered  resistance  to  rifampicin  and  66 
isoniazid-resistant. And 32 isolates were multi drug resistant 
(MDR),  from  Feb  to  December  2008.  All  283  tuberculosis 
patient  cases  had  proven  registration  of  clinical  diagnostic 
examination,  such  as  chest  X-ray,  PPD,  cough,  weight  loss, 
gender,  etc.  All  isolates  were  cultured  on  Lo¨wenstein-
Jensen  solid  medium  and  grown  colonies  were  identified  to 
the  species  level  using  TCH  (2-thiophene  carboxylic  acid) 
and  PN99B  (paranitrobenzoic  acid)  selective  media  using 
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  standard 
biochemical  procedures.  M.  tuberculosis  reference  strains 
CDC1551  and  H37Rv  and  four  susceptible  isolates  of  M. 
tuberculosis  were  used  from  the  banked  strain  collection  of 
the  Pasteur  Institute  of  Iran.  M.  tuberculosis  strain  210  is  a 
susceptible  reference  isolate  from  the  M.  tuberculosis  bank 
at  the  Belarusian  Research  Institute  of  Epidemiology  and 
Clinical Microbiology and was also used as an internal nega-
tive control [5]. 

Susceptibility Testing 

  Antimicrobial  drug  susceptibility  testing  (AMST)  was 
performed  using  the  CDC  standard  conventional  propor-
tional  method:  rifampin  (40  _g/ml),  isoniazid  (2  _g/ml),  
ethambutol (2 _g/ml),  ethionamide (20 _g/ml), streptomycin 
(4 _g/ml), and kanamycin (20 _g/ml) were used in slants and 
in  addition  to  breakpoint  concentrations  for  isoniazid  (0.1 
_g/ml)  and  rifampin  (2.0  _g/ml)  in  the  Bactec  system  (10). 
Four  sensitive M.  tuberculosis isolates  and  an  H37Rv  strain 
were  used  as  negative  controls.  Mutations  in  the  rpoB  gene 
were  identified  from  41  rifampin-resistant  isolates  by  se-

34    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 

quencing  methods  (see  below),  and  AMST  was  performed 
following  sequencing  to  confirm  resistance  using  different 
concentrations  of  rifampin  (50,  75,  and  100  _g/ml)  through 
the  slant  proportional  method  [8]  and  also  using  BACTEC 
system  (Becton  Dickinson  company  in  tuberculosis  labora-
tory  of  Institute  of  pulmonology  and  tuberculosis  in  Minsk, 
Belarus. 

PCR Amplification 

  DNA  was  extracted  and  purified  using  the  Fermentas 
DNA extraction procedure (K512). M. tuberculosis reference 
strains  CDC1551  and  H37Rv  and  four  sensitive  isolates  of 
M.  tuberculosis  from  the  banked  strain  collection  of  the 
Massoud  and  Zia  Zrifi  Laboratories  were  used  as  negative 
controls.  A  411-bp  fragment  of  the  rpoB  gene  and  209-bp 
fragment of katG was amplified by PCR with primers rpoB-
F  (5-TACGGTCGGCGAGCTGATCC-3)  and  rpoB-R  (5-
TACGGCGTTTCGATGAACC-3)  and  katG-F  5-GAAAC- 
AGCGGCGCTGATCGT-3,  katG-R  5-GTTGTCCCATTT- 
CGTCGGGG-3(22). PCR was carried out in 50 μL of a reac-
tion  mixture  containing  50  mM  KCl,  10  mM  Tris  (pH  8.0), 
1.5  mM  MgCl2,  5  μM  of  deoxynucleoside  triphosphates 
(dNTPs),  1U  Taq  polymerase,  20  pmoles  of  each  set  of 
primers,  and  6  μM  of  chromosomal  DNA  (24).  For  rpoB 
fragment  Samples  were  then  subjected  to  one  cycle  at  94°C 
for 5 min, followed by 36 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 57°C for 
1 min, 72°C for 1 min,  and a final  cycle  at 72°C for 10 min 
to complete the elongation of the PCR intermediate products. 
For  katG  the  following  thermocycler  parameters  were  used: 
initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 42 cycles of denatura-
tion  at  94°C  for  1  min;  primer  annealing  at  57°C  for  1  min; 
extension  at  72°C  for  1  min;  and  a  final  extension  at  72°C 
for 10 min. PCR products were then run on 2% agarose gels 
and  examined  for  the  presence  of  the  411-bp  and  209  bp 
band  after  ethidium  bromide  staining.  The  DNA  Extraction 
were performed on agaros using Sigma  Kit (124K6083) and 
the  products  were  checked  and  purified  on  the  gel  electro-
phoresis  and  purified  rpoB  and  katG  segment  were  ampli-
fied.  The  PCR  product  was  amplified,  purified  again,  and 
controlled  on  the  electrophoresis  gel.  The  final  purified  my-
cobacterial DNA was used for sequencing. 

DNA Sequencing of the rpoB Fragment 

 
Sequencing  of  411-bp  fragment  were  done  using  the 
same forward and reveres primers; 33 cycles of denaturation 
at 94°C for 30min; primer  annealing  at 54°C for 30 sec; ex-
tension  at  72°C  for  90  sec,  A  411-bp  fragment  of  the  rpoB 
gene  extracted  from  tuberculosis  strains  were  sequenced  by 
Amersham  auto  sequencer  and  Amersham  Pharmacia  DYE-
namic  ET  Terminator  Cycle  Sequencing  Premix  Kits. 
Alignment  of  the  DNA  fragments  (rpoB)  was  carried  out 
with  the  help  of  MEGA  software  (Gen  bank_  PUBMED/ 
BLAST).

Data Analyzing of DNA Sequencing 

  The  411-bp  fragments  of  the  rpoB  gene  were  amplified 
by  PCR  using  the  forward  or  reverse  primers  mentioned 
above using the following conditions: 33 cycles of denatura-
tion at 94°C for 30 s, primer annealing at 57°C for 30 s, and 
extension  at  72°C  for  90  s.  The  rpoB  gene  fragments  were 
sequenced  by  using  the  protocol  of  the  DYEnamic  ET  
dye  terminator  kit  (MegaBACE)  and  a  MegaBACE  4000 
DNA  sequencer  (Amersham  Biosciences  [currently  GE 
Healthcare],  Piscataway,  NJ).  Alignment  of  the  DNA  frag-
ments  (rpoB)  was  carried  out  using  MEGA  and  DNAMAN 
software and was  compared with  the  standard M.  tuberculo-
sis reference strains  CDC1551, H37Rv, and 210. The Blast2 
sequencing  program  (NCBI)  was  used  for  DNA  sequence 
comparisons  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).  Align- 
ment  of  the  DNA  fragments  (rpoB)  was  carried  out  with 
MEGA 3.1 software (www.megasoftware.net/), and data were 
analyzed  and  edited  with  DNAMAN  software  (Lynnonon 
Biosoft, Quebec, Canada). 

 
In  this  study,  all  smear  microscopy,  acid-fast  bacilli 
(AFB)  culture,  susceptibility  testing,  and  PCR  assays  were 
performed  at  the  mycobacteriology  department  of  the  Pas-
teur  Institute  of  Iran,  and  the  DNA  sequencing  analysis  was 
conducted at the Belarusian Research Institute of Epidemiol-
ogy  and  Microbiology,  Clinical  Microbiology  Department. 
The obtained data were analyzed and edited with DNAMAN 
programs. 

Mutations Spectrum and Frequency Analysis 

  DNAMAN  is  a  sequence  analysis  software  package  for 
IBM  compatible  computers  with  Microsoft  Windows  95/98 
or  NT/2000  systems.  This  package  provides  effective  and 
convenient  tools  for  molecular  geneticist  to  deal  with  fre-
quently  used  analyses  in  research.  It  contains  text  editor  for 
fragments sequence alignment. The text editor is identical to 
WINDOWS WordPad. The  editor allows deleting or pasting 
any text or sequence to files [24]. 

Cluster Analysis by Neighbor-Joining Method 

  The basic unit of data used in Neighbor-Joining (Nearest 
Neighbor)  cluster  analysis  is  the  homologies  coefficient  de-
rived  from  any  one  of  the  homologies  analysis  formula.  A 
homologies  matrix  derived  from  sequential  pair  wise  com-
parisons  of  two  most  similar  operable  taxonomic  units 
(OTU) or clusters of OTUs is used to construct a phenogram. 
This  phenogram  is  setup  with  the  distance  matrix  using  the 
Neighbor-Joining  method.  Phylogenetic  evolution  tree  dem-
onstrated  related  homologies  between  any  two  sequences  in

Unweighted  Pair-Group  Method  Using  Arithmetic  
Averages 

Sequencing of 209-bp fragment of katG gene was ampli-

 
fied  by  PCR  using  forward  and  reveres  primers;  33  cycles  
of denaturation at 94°C for 30sec; primer annealing  at 48°C 
for 45 sec; extension at 60°C for 4 min. The katG gene frag-
ments  of  tuberculosis  isolates  were  sequenced  using  the 

  Unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Mycobacterial Strains and Susceptibilities 

 
In  this  study,  we  had  286  available  M.  tuberculosis  iso-
lates,  of  these,  59  (20.8%)  had  never  been  treated  for  tuber-
culosis  and  the  other  27(9.5%)  had  previously  received 
treatment.  Of  the  283  isolates,  211  had  sensitive  to  all  four 
evaluated antibiotics and 72 (25.4%) demonstrated resistance 
to rifampicin with other drugs or isoniazid (n=68) with other 
drugs.  

  The  rate  of  multi  drug  resistant  (MDR)  was  12.1% 
(n=34). Most of the patients with drug-resistant isolates (74/ 
90-82%) were aged between 15 and 54 years.  

Drug Susceptibility 

  All  72  isolates  of  rifampicin-  isoniazid  resistant  exam-
ined  were  resistant  to  rifampicin  (97%),  isoniazid  (91%), 
streptomycin  (90%)  and  18  isolates  (48%)  were  resistant  to 
etambutol.  In  this  research  has  been  identified  two  strains 
mono-resistance  to  rifampicin  and  isoniazid  resistant  was 
isolated for 4 isolates.  

Analysis for rpoB Gene – Iranian Isolates 

60 mutations and 13 micro deletions were identified in 29 
 
rifampicin-resistances  MBT 
rifampicin-
resistances MBT isolates (15%) no mutations were found in 
the  core  region  of  the  rpoB  gene.  Of  60  found  mutations  6 
silent  (8.3%)  and  54  (91.7%)  were  missense.  Most  of  de-
tected  deletions  were  identified  in  codon  510  GAG/_AG 

(85%). 

In  5 

(12.5%).  All  silent  mutations  were  localized  in  codon  507, 
missense mutations revealed 23 types of amino acid substitu-
tions.  Most  frequent  mutated  codons  in  Iranian  strains  were 
523 GGG/GG_, GGG/GCG and 526 CAC/TAC, CAC/CGC, 
CAC/AAC,  CAC/TTC,  CAC/CAA,  CAC/_GC  (six  types  of 
mutations).  Mutations  in  codons  510,  507,  531  were  ob-
served  in  27%,  24%,  and  21%  of  isolates  and  correspond-
ingly  Mutations  in  codon  523  resulted  in  Gly523Ala  re-
placement  and in codon 531 Ser531Leu and Ser531Phe. We 
observed 6 alleles in codon 526, 3 alleles in triplets 507, 508, 
513. In 6 strains (18%) harboured single mutations placed in 
codons  526,  510,  while  isolates  with  multiple  mutations  re-
vealed  double  34%,  triple  22%  and  quadruple  3%  of  the 
strains. 12% of strains harboured 5 mutations (Fig. 1).

had  one  mutation,  twenty  three  (52%)  –  two  mutations, 
seven (16%) – three mutations, four (7%) – four ones. Of the 
44  Iranian  rifampin-resistant  isolates,  31  randomly  selected 
isolates  were  chosen  based  on  the  WHO-defined  clinical 
symptom  definition  (35).  Of  these  31  rifampin-resistant  iso-
lates,  22  were  isolated  from  the  sputa  of  patients  with  pri-
mary  infections  and  9  (41.30%)  were  from  that  of  patients 
bearing  secondary  cases.  Among  the  strains  mentioned  dou-
ble  mutations  were  detected  of  which  three  in  codons  531 
(TCG(cid:1)TTG)  and  510  (CAG(cid:1)GAG).  Double  mutation  was 
also  observed 
(TCG(cid:1)TTG),  523 
(GGC(cid:1)GCG),  512  (AGC(cid:1)GCC)  and  507  (GGC(cid:1)GCC). 
One  strain  had 
thee  silent  mutations  in  codons  520 
(CCG(cid:1)CCC),  507  (GGC(cid:1)AGC)  and  510  (CAG(cid:1)AAG). 
The  research  accomplished  showed  that  one  mutation  was 
more  frequently  observed  in  codons  526,  531  (36%,  36%); 
two  ones  –  in  codons  526,  510  (52%,  52%).  Three  or  four 
mutations  were  detected  in  codons  510  (70%).  To  study  the 
prevalence of mutations in the Republic of Belarus compari-
son was made depending on the region of residence. Accord-
ing  to  the  result  in  all  regions  of  Belarus  two  mutations  are 
found with the same frequency. Four mutations in rpoB gene 
were  only  detected  in  Minsk  (2.27%)  and  Minsk  region 
(4.54%).

Analysis for katG Gene - Belarusian Isolates 

 
In  the  four  isolates  of  all  isolates  that  were  sensitive  to 
isoniazid any mutation were not identified in the region 209 
bp  of  katG  gene.  Nucleotide  change  were  detected  in  af-
fected codons of PCR product segment 209 bp of katG gene, 
305,  306,  307,  314,  316,  321,  328,  315,  316,357,  454,463 
and 309. Four types of mutations were demostrated in codon 
315:  AGC(cid:1)ACC  (n=36)36%,  AGC(cid:1)AGG  (n=1)0.9%, 
AGC(cid:1)AAC (n=2)1.8%, AGC(cid:1)GGC (n=1)0.9%. One type 
of mutation was showed in codon 316: GGC(cid:1)AGC (n=16)%, 

four  types  of  mutations  were  identified  in  codon  309: 
GGT(cid:1)GGT  (n=7)%,  GGT(cid:1)GCT  (n=4)%,  GGT(cid:1)GTC 
(n=3)%,  GGT(cid:1)GGG  (n=1)%.  Mutations  in  codon  309  re-
vealed  34%,  in  codon  316  –  37%,  other  types  of  mutations 
29%  of  all  detected  mutations.  Among  all  isolates  (n=40) 
95%  of  mutation  were  demostrated  in  codon  315  (four  type 
mutation). For two isolates 2 types of mutations were seen in 
codon  357  GAC(cid:1)CAC  and  GAC(cid:1)AAC,  in  addition  two 
mutations were also observed in codon 463 CGG(cid:1)CTG and 
454 GAG(cid:1)CGA. In all 42 strains, one mutation 21.5%, 16 – 
two mutations38%, 9 - three mutations21.5%, four – 4 muta-
tions9.5%  and  4  –  five  mutations9.5%  were  determined. 
Two  isolates  have  not  any  mutations  in  kat  G  gene.  Three 
silent mutations were detected in codons: 306 (CCG(cid:1)CCC), 
309 (GGT(cid:1)GGG) and 314 (ACC(cid:1)ACG) these silent muta-
tions  revealed  no  effect  on  the  susceptibility  pattern  tested 
strains. 

EVOLUTIONARY  GENETIC  ANALYSIS  OF  M.  TU-
BERCULOSIS ISOLATES FROM IRAN  

 
Sequencing  of  81  bp  fragment  of rpoB  gene  was  carried 
out  for  34  strains.  From  of  the  sequences  obtained,  a  phe-
nograms  was  constructed  by  UPGMA  and  Neighbour-
Joining methods in DNAMAN software. 

  Homologic  phenogram  was  constructed  by  UPGMA 
method  using  distance  matrix.  According  to  the  phenogram, 
the  Iranian  strain  710  is  closely  related  to  the  strains  from 
Taiwan,  China  and  India  (BLAST  software).  The  other 
strains are supposed to have originated from this one. 

  Phylogenetic  phenogram.  With  the  help  of  Neighbor-
Joining  method  the  data  obtained  confirm  the  results  of 
Neighbor-Joining method for the Iranian strain 710 (Fig. 1). 
  According to the phenogram one strain from the town of 
Zabol is older than the rest of the strains (it is about 77 years 
old), and it was considerably changed after its appearance in 
Iran  and  was  resistant  to  anti  tuberculosis  drugs  (Fig.  4,9). 
This  strain  contains  five  mutations.  When  it  appeared  in  
Iran it possessed drug resistance. The other strains similar to 
each other are located on the same branch of the phenogram 
(Fig. 1). 
  The  other  strains  are  divided  into  2  groups:  group  A  – 
similar  to  the  standard  and  Eastern  strains  (China,  Taiwan), 
they  are  about  10  years  old.  These  strains  were  changed  in 
Iran  and  acquired  mutations  (Fig. 4.9);  group  B  –  strains  of 
another  genotype.  They  are  grouped  separately  on  the  phe-
nogram and became prevalent in Iran (they are called Iranian 
residential strains) (Fig. 2). 
  DNAMAN software allowed to obtain general classifica-
tion  of M. tuberculosis  collected  from  the  patients  from  dif-
ferent  regions  of  Iran.  In  the  phenogram  constructed  by 
Minimum  method  all  strains  are  divided  into  three  genetic 
groups  and  in  each  of  them  there  are  closely  related  strains 
(Fig. 3). 

Strains  of  group  A  are  similar  to  the  standard  ones,  and 
 
formed  not  long  ago;  group  B  comprises  two  strains  of  ear-
lier  origin  than  the  others,  and  it’s  obvious  that  they  were 
changed  after  their  appearance  in  Iran;  group  C  comprises 
four strains which appeared not long ago.

Fig. (3). Geogenetic phenogram constructed by Minimum method for Iranian strains. M= Mutation, In the this figure mutation has been dem-
onstrated for Iranian Isolates. 

  According  to  the  phenogram  constructed  by  UPGMA 
method all strains are divided into two genetic groups. Some 
of the strains differ in genotype and divergence time and are 
located  separately  (figures  4.12  –  4.13).  60%  of  Iranian 
strains  diverged  as  a  result  of  mutations  from  the  same 
M. tuberculosis  strain  710  similar  to  the  strains  from  China, 
Taiwan  and  India.  20%  of  the  strains  had  the  highest  ho-
mologies  with  the  ones  from  Taiwan.  One  isolate  (from 
Zabol  region)  710  is  related  evolutionary  to  ancestral 
M. tuberculosis family. In this sample there are no mutations 
in  codon  531.  Strain  163  located  separately  and  the  number 
of  strains  combined  in  one  group  originated  from  it.  Four 
isolates  belong  to  the  standard  M. tuberculosis  strains 
(H37RV,  CDC1551),  and  on  of  these  four  is  similar  to  In-
dian strain 3062 Iran (Fig. 4). 

 
23  isolates  are  combined  in  groups  and  have  Iranian  
origin.  Five  isolates  diverges  from  the  primary  sample:  
one from Tehran, one from Kurdestan, three ones are similar 
to  the  strains  from  Taiwan  (TMB  522).  All  the  strains  
from  Iranian  patients  are  divided  into  two  genetic  groups:  
A  –  similar  to  Eastern  strains  (Taiwan,  China,  India,  Japan, 
and Korea), they are about 11 years old; B – Iranian residen-
tial  strains  which  appeared  more  than  20  years  ago  
(Fig. 5).  

 
In  the  cause  of  study  of  mutations  in  rpoB  gene  in  the 
strains from Iranian patients the most frequent changes were 
found  in  codons  523  and  526.  In  the  isolates  from  the  pa-
tients  with  primary  tuberculosis  (12  strains)  the  changes 
were  detected  in  codons  526  (28.5%),  523  (21.4%),  510 
(14.2%).  In  the  isolates  from  the  patients  with  secondary 
tuberculosis (22 strains) mutations were found in codons 526 
(13.5%), 523 (23.7%) and 510 (11.8%). 

 
In  Iranian  M. tuberculosis  strains  in  katG  gene  the  most 
affected  codons  were  315  and  311.  In  the  strains  from  the 
patients with primary tuberculosis the changes were detected 
in codons 315 (25%), 311 (0.9%), 299 (0.9%). In the strains 
from  the  patients  with  secondary  tuberculosis  mutations 
were found in codons 315 (36.8%), 299 (18.4%), 311 (21%). 
According  to the phenograms constructed for rpoB gene the 
strain 710 from the town of Zabol is more closely related  to 
the  Chinese  strains.  The  other  strains  are  supposed  to  have 
diverged  from  this  strain.  Iranian  strain  710  has  the  greatest 
homologies  with  the  strains  from  China,  Taiwan  and  India. 
Strain  710  from  Iran  has  the  highest  homologies  of  its  ge-

nome  with  the  strains  from  China,  Taiwan  and  India.  It  
appeared about 77 years ago. 

  Using  Neighbour-Joining  method  evolutionary  phe-
nograms  were  obtained  for  Iranian  strains  which  were  
divided  into  two  genetic  groups:  group  A  –  strains  more  
related  to  Eastern  ones  (Taiwan,  China,  India,  Japan,  and 
Korea); group B – Iranian residential strains. 

  Evolutionary  phenograms  constructed  for  the  first  time 
for  M. tuberculosis  strains  collected  in  Iran  show  that  strain 
710 of rpoB gene collected from the town of Zabol is closely 
related  to  the  strains  from  China,  Taiwan  and  India.  The 
other  strains  are  supposed  to  have  diverged  from  this  one. 
All  strains  analysed  collected  from  Iranian  patients  are  di-
vided  into  2  genetic  groups:  group  A  –  similar  to  Eastern 
strains  (Taiwan,  China,  India,  Japan,  Korea)  (they  are  about 
11  years  old);  group  B  –  Iranian  residential  strains  which 
appeared about 23 years ago. 

  Construction  of  evolutionary  phenograms  using  se-
quences  of  M. tuberculosis  resistance  genes  collected  in  
Iran  and  bioinformatics  analysis  are  recommended  to  study 
epidemic process of tuberculosis.

software. 

  Phylogenetic  phenogram.  With  the  help  of  nucleotide 
sequencing  methods  precise  description  of  small  gene  frag-
ments  can  be  obtained;  with  the  help  of  other  methods  of 
molecular  strain  typing  larger  genome  fragments  can  be 
compared,  but  finally  the  comparison  should  be  fulfilled  by 
means  of  homologies  and  difference  evaluation.  For  this 
purpose  a  distance  matrix  should  be  constructed  by  Neigh-
bour-Joining  method.  An  assumption  is  made  about  inde-
pendent  evolution  of  characters.  In  the  cause  of  bootstrap-
ping other analysis functions can be used. The data obtained 
with  the  help  of  this  software  confirm  the  results  of  Neigh-
bour-Joining method for the strain 408 isolated from the pa-
tient from Mogilev region. 

 
Isolates  collected  from  the  tuberculosis  patients  from 
Belarus were branched into 3 genetic groups. The first one is

closer to European isolates (from Italy, France, Finland), the 
second one – to Central Asia (from Russia, China, Taiwan), 
the third one – Belarusian resident (Fig. 7). 

  According  to  the  phenogram  the  isolates  selected  from 
Mogilev  city  patients  is  essentially  older  (44  years  old). 
Within  this  period  it  was  not  considerably  changed  after  its 
appearance  in  Belarus.  The  other  isolates  with  the  help  of 
bioinformatics  analysis  has  been  branched  into  3  main 
geogenetic groups: 

1.  Isolates  of  the  first  group  were  more  similar  to  the  iso-
lates  from  China  and  Taiwan  which  diverged  in  the  last 
10 years (evolution genetic rate), i.e. they were relatively 
new  ones,  and  that  is  confirmed  by  the  nucleotide 
changes (Fig. 6, 7). 

2.  Isolates  of  the  second  group  diverged  earlier;  they  
were  older  than  the  isolates  of  the  first  group  (16  years 
old- rate of evolution genetic) (Fig. 7). 

3.  Isolates  of  the  third  group  are  similar  to  European  iso-

lates and only circulate in the Brest city. 

  All the other isolates were very similar to each other and 
located on the same branch (Fig. 8). With the help of bioin-

formatics  software  general  classification  of  M. tuberculosis 
isolated from the tuberculosis patients from different cities of 
Belarus  was  obtained.  In  the  phenogram  constructed  by 
Minimum  method  all  isolates  were  divided  into  five 
branches,  and  in  each  branch  there  were  neighbouring  iso-
lates (Fig. 8). 

  According to the phenogram constructed isolate 408 from 
Mogilev city was closer in its primary structure to the isolate 
from Russia and China (Fig. 6-9). 

  According to unweighted pair groups' method with use of 
arithmetic average (UPGMA) it was obvious that the isolates 
from  Mogilev  was  older,  and  the  other  ones  associated  with 
each  other  depending  on  the  homologies  level  of  the  frag-
ments  examined  (Fig.  9).  It  is  evident  that  the  Brest  isolates 
differ  from  the  rest  ones  and  probably  originate  from  West-
ern Europe and represent a separate cluster (Fig. 9).  

 
Five  isolates  made  up  a  separate  branch  from  the  first 
one:  one  strain  from  Mogilev  city,  another  –  from  Vitebsk 
city.  Sequences  of  3  isolates  were  close  to  the  ones  of  the 
isolates  from  Italy,  India,  and  Taiwan.  Sequences  of  four 
isolates  correspond  to  the  ones  of  the  standard  strains 
H37RV  and  CDC1551.  One  isolate  from  the  city  of  Minsk

completely  corresponds  to  the  standard  isolates.  In  this 
study,  we  identified  different  geogenetic  isolates  from  Bela-
rusian  tuberculosis  patients  that  distributed  in  the  cities  of 
Belarus that similar to isolates from India, Taiwan, Italy and 
China (Fig. 2-4).  

  With the help of Neighbour-Joining method evolutionary 
genetic  phenograms  were  obtained  for  Belarusian  isolates 
which  were  divided  into  three  geogenetic  groups:  A  –  iso-
lates  more  similar  to  Asian  isolates  (Taiwan,  China);  B  – 
Belarusian strains; C – European strains (Fig. 6, 7). 

  According  to  the  phenograms  obtained  by  UPGMA 
method strains were divided into three geogenetic groups: A 
– closely related to Eastern strains (Taiwan, China); B – Bel-

arusian  residential  isolates;  C  –  related  to  European  isolates 
(Fig. 9). 

  Evolutionary genetic phenograms constructed for the first 
time  for  M. tuberculosis  isolates  selected  in  Belarus  show 
that  isolates  408  of rpoB  gene  collected  from  the  tuberculo-
sis patient from Mogilev city was more related to the isolates 
circulating  in  Russia  and  China.  The  other  isolates  were  di-
vided  into  three  geogenetic  groups  (appeared  about  9  years 
ago- rate and time of evolution - Fig. 6-9).  

  Construction  of  evolutionary  genetic  phenogram  using 
sequences  of  M. tuberculosis  resistance  genes  collected  in 
Belarus - Iran and bioinformatics analysis are recommended 
to study epidemic process of tuberculosis.

In the final inclusion, we have resulted that from  all  iso-
lates  in  Iran  and  Belarus  is  genetic  analogy  evolution  in  the 
group  A  -  closely  related  to  Eastern  Asian  strains  and  this 
analogy  was  most  in  the  isolates  from  capital  of  countries. 
This  result  has  been  indicated  that  Asian  strains  circulated 
between  countries  via  person  in  which  contaminated  by  
M. tuberculosis and is distributing speedily.
