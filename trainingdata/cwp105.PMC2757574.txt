The solution conformation of a fully sulfated heparin-
derived tetrasaccharide, I, was studied in the presence of
a 4-fold excess of Ca2+. Proton–proton and proton–carbon
residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured in a neu-
tral aligning medium. The order parameters of two rigid
hexosamine rings of I were determined separately using sin-
gular value decomposition and ab initio structures of dis-
accharide fragments of I. The order parameters were very
similar implying that a common order tensor can be used to
analyze the structure of I. Using one order tensor, RDCs of
both hexosamine rings were used as restraints in molecular
dynamics simulations. RDCs of the inner iduronic acid were
calculated for every point of the molecular dynamics trajec-
tory. The ﬁtting of the calculated RDCs of the two forms
of the iduronic acid to the experimental values yielded a
population of 1C4 and 2So conformers of iduronic acid that
agreed well with the analysis based on proton–proton scalar
coupling constants. The glycosidic linkage torsion angles in
RDC-restrained molecular dynamics (MD) structures of I
are consistent with the interglycosidic three-bond proton–
carbon coupling constants. These structures also show that
the shape of heparin is not affected dramatically by the con-
formational ﬂexibility of the iduronic acid ring. This is in
line with conclusions of previous studies based on MD simu-
lations and the analysis of 1H-1H NOEs. Our work therefore
demonstrates the effectiveness of RDCs in the conforma-
tional analysis of glycosaminoglycans.

recognized for decades. Nevertheless, the underlying molec-
ular basis of these interactions has only emerged through
more recent biophysical investigations (reviewed in Casu and
Lindahl (2001); Mulloy and Linhardt (2001); Capila and
Linhardt (2002); Hricov´ıni et al. (2002); Powell et al. (2004);
Imberty et al. (2007)). Early insights into the molecular struc-
ture of GAGs originated from the studies of heparin, a prominent
member of the GAG family, by X-ray diffraction (Nieduszynski
et al. 1977) and solution state NMR (Mulloy et al. 1993; Mulloy
and Forster 2000).

The repeating disaccharide unit of many GAGs, including
heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and dermatan sulfate (DS), con-
tains iduronic acid (IdoA), a hexopyranose which is known to
adopt several conformations (4C1, 1C4, and 2So). This ﬂexibil-
ity of IdoA has attracted considerable attention (Ferro et al.
1990; Forster and Mulloy 1993; Ernst et al. 1998; Hricov´ıni
2006; Pol-Fachin and Verli 2008) as it can potentially affect
how GAGs interact with proteins. Indeed, signiﬁcant experi-
mental evidence points to the importance of IdoA for protein
GAG interactions. To mention a few more recent examples, the
lack of IdoA in HS derived from Hsepi
mouse affected its
interactions with grow factors and cell signaling (Jia et al. 2009).
Binding and activity of less-sulfated species interacting with the
hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor are greatly enhanced by
the presence of IdoA in the GAG sequence with otherwise com-
parable overall sulfation levels (Catlow et al. 2008). IdoA plays
a crucial role in achieving the appropriate 3D structure of the
heparin-pentasaccharide (Hricov´ıni et al. 2001) and heparin-
octasaccharide when interacting with antithrombin (Guerrini
et al. 2006) or heparin-tetrasaccharides interacting with the ba-
sic ﬁbroblast growth factor (Guglieri et al. 2008).

X-ray structures of protein–GAG complexes show the IdoA
residue in either 1C4 or 2So conformation. Interestingly, the two
internal IdoA residues of a heparin hexasaccharide bound to
the basic ﬁbroblast growth factor exist in different conforma-
tions (Faham et al. 1996). Furthermore, solution state NMR
studies of a heparin-like hexasaccharide in a complex with the
acidic ﬁbroblast growth factor (Canales et al. 2005) revealed
that IdoA2S is present in the bound state in an equilibrium of
1C4 and 2So forms.

Introduction

The essential role of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)–protein inter-
actions in the regulation of physiological processes has been

The question that then arises is why are the binding properties
of IdoA so favorable? Is it that the ﬂexibility of IdoA affects
the geometry of glycosidic linkages or is it the larger conforma-
tional space available to sulfate groups that enhances its binding
properties? The current evidence, based mostly on the analysis
of NOE data of heparin and heparin oligosaccharides, indicates
that the chair-skew boat equilibrium of IdoA has only a limited
effect on the glycosidic linkage conformation of heparin (Ferro

their two potential drawbacks are: (i) NOEs only report on the
local structure and (ii) their interpretation in ﬂexible systems
is notoriously difﬁcult (Neuhaus and Williamson 2000). On the
other hand, residual dipolar coupling constants (RDCs) provide
global structural information and thus have the potential to char-
acterize the overall shape of molecules (Tjandra and Bax 1997).
We have therefore decided to investigate the shape of heparin
by using this recently introduced NMR methodology. In order
to make our investigation tractable, we have limited the size of
the studied heparin fragment to a tetrasaccharide. Our sample
was prepared by the enzymatic cleavage of heparin, which re-
sulted in the nonreducing terminal IdoA being converted to an
unsaturated uronic acid. We refer to this compound as heparin
U-tetrasaccharide, I (Figure 1).

The activity of heparin can be modulated by calcium ions
(Rabenstein et al. 1995). Similarly, the structurally related hep-
aran sulfate interacts with extracellular proteins and in several
cases these interactions involve cations such as Ca2+
and Mg2+
(Chevalier et al. 2004). We have therefore conducted our studies
in a 4-fold molar excess of Ca2+
with regard to I. The presence
of Ca2+
has been shown not to affect the overall shape of a
heparin hexasaccharide (Angulo et al. 2000; de Paz et al. 2001;
Chevalier et al. 2004); however, it is known to affect the equi-
librium of 1C4 and 2So forms of the IdoA (Ferro et al. 1990;
Chevalier et al. 2004). As a beneﬁcial side effect for NMR
studies, by inﬂuencing the kinetics of the chair-skew boat equi-
librium of IdoA, the presence of Ca2+
coincidently sharpens
NMR spectral lines (de Paz et al. 2001).

Results

Internal dynamics of rings A and D
The internal dynamics of the constituent monosaccharide rings
of U-tetrasaccharide I was analyzed using vicinal proton–
proton coupling constants. The coupling constants (Table I)
were determined using intensity-based methods (Pham et al.
2002, 2004; Jin et al. 2007) discussed later in the paper. As
conﬁrmed by the large 3J23, 3J34, and 3J45 coupling constants,
the two glucosamine rings (A and C) are stable in the 4C1 con-
formation. On the other hand, the internal iduronic acid ring (B)
and the nonreducing terminal unsaturated uronic acid ring (D)
undergo conformational averaging. The internal iduronic acid
can in principle adopt three different conformations, 4C1, 1C4,
and 2So, but only 1C4 and 2So were found previously in fully sul-
fated species (Mulloy and Forster 2000). Based on an idealized
geometry of 1C4 and 2So forms, the theoretical 3JHH coupling

constants were calculated using the recently derived Karplus
equation parameterized for sulfated GAGs (Hricov´ıni and B´ızik
2007; Hricov´ıni et al. 2007). The population of each conformer
was calculated by ﬁtting the calculated coupling constants to
the experimental data (Table I) yielding 76% of 1C4 and 24%
2So forms for the sulfated IdoA residue. This is in line with 79%
of 1C4 observed in heparin (Ferro et al. 1990) or 70% of 1C4
in heparin hexasaccharide (Chevalier et al. 2004), both in the
presence of Ca2+
. A similar analysis performed for the D ring
using Karplus equations (Haasnoot et al. 1980) incorporating
the effects of substituents yielded 78% and 22% of 1H2 and 2H1
conformers, respectively.

Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations of I
Amber (Case et al. 2002) force ﬁeld solution structures of I
were generated by free molecular dynamics using the protocols
described in the Material and methods. Various starting confor-
mations for rings B and D were tried, while for rings A and C,
the conformation was always set to 4C1. As expected, the latter
conformation did not change during MD simulations. Ring B
showed transitions between 1C4 and 2So forms, while the 4C1
conformer was not observed. Ring D quickly converted from
the 1H2 form to the 2H1 form. This transition was faster when
the B ring was in the 2So form; when simulations were started
with the D ring in the 2H1 conformation, it never changed to
the 1H2 form. A 4 ns nonrestrained MD of I is illustrated in
Figure 2).

Almost exclusive appearance of the 2H1 conformer for ring
D during the unrestrained molecular dynamics contradicts the
results of our analysis of experimental proton–proton coupling
constants, which indicate that the 1H2 form dominates (78%).
This discrepancy could be explained by inaccurate parameteri-
zation of the AMBER force ﬁeld for this unsaturated ring or in-
accurate parameterization of the Karplus curves used to analyze
the coupling constants. The latter is unlikely as the experimental
3J23 = 2.65 Hz is too small to be consistent with a large diaxial
3J23 (10.2 Hz) coupling constant of the 2H1 conformer. Inade-
quate performance of the AMBER force ﬁeld for 4,5-uronic
acids has been noted previously (Adeyeye et al. 2003). As MD
simulations are an integral part of our methodology, the discrep-
ancy between the experimental data and simulations had to be

taken into account. We have therefore concluded that proceed-
ing with the analysis of the D ring would add little value to our
work and decided to concentrate on the trisaccharide fragment
CBA of I. This is in line with the main focus of our investiga-
tion on the conformation of native heparin/HS and the effects
of conformational ﬂexibility of the internal iduronic acid on
the overall shape of the molecule. Ring D, a modiﬁed terminal
iduronic acid, is a consequence of preparation of oligosaccha-
rides by enzymatic cleavage and does not have a role in the
biology of heparin/HS.

Our MD simulations show that the dynamics of the BA and
CB glycosidic linkages is affected by the state of ring B as il-
lustrated in Figure 3 using / maps. These maps show the
behavior of two dihedral angles, H (H1 − C1 − O4(cid:3) − C4(cid:3))
and H (C1 − O4(cid:3) − C4(cid:3) − H4(cid:3)) describing the conformation of
glycosidic linkages. Considering the BA linkage ﬁrst, a popu-
lation of conformers exists that has very similar dihedral angles
irrespective of the state of ring B. However, there are other con-
◦
in the BA angle between the 2So
formers that differ by 60
and 1C4 forms of the B ring. Characterizing the CB linkage,
◦
the CB and CB angles differ by 90
, respectively,
depending on the state of the B ring. The geometry of the gly-
cosidic linkages has a major inﬂuence on the conformation of
carbohydrates and their overall shape. Therefore, the results of
unrestrained MD indicate that the conformation of ring B could
affect the overall shape of heparin/HS polysaccharide.

and 40

In the next stage, two types of experimental parameters, which
have not been used previously in the conformational analysis of
heparin, are employed to assess the effects of the conformational
ﬂexibility of ring B on the overall shape of I: residual dipolar
coupling constants (RDCs) and the interglycosidic long-range
proton-carbon coupling constants (nJCH). The former are used
as restraints in MD simulations, while the latter are used to cross
validate the results of these simulations.

Measurement, validation, and analysis of residual dipolar
coupling constants
Provided that a sufﬁcient amount of compound is available, the
most easily accessible RDCs in carbohydrates are those between
the directly attached protons and carbons (1DCH). However, in
rigid hexopyranose rings, the majority of equatorial positions are

occupied by OR groups, while all axial CH orientations point in
the same direction, i.e., are spatially degenerated. In α-D-GlcNS
hexopyranose rings of I, only two independent orientations are
sampled by the CH vectors – the axial and one equatorial, along
the C1αH1α bond. When a limited number of RDCs are available,
an independent determination of the order tensor is required
(Zweckstetter and Bax 2000; Landersjo et al. 2000; Almond
et al. 2001; Lycknert et al. 2001; Almond and Axelsen 2002;
Azurmendi and Bush 2002). This approach therefore relies on
an initial model describing the overall shape of the molecule.
A self-consistent analysis of RDCs via the Saupe order ma-
trix (Saupe 1968; Losonczi et al. 1999) on the other hand only
requires structures of rigid fragments to be known. However,
this approach requires ≥5 RDCs necessitating RDCs between
remote nuclei, such as nDHH or nDCH, to be measured. Due to
the dependence of RDCs on the gyromagnetic ratios of the cou-
pled nuclei, accurate measurement of nDCH coupling constants
requires stronger alignment. Such alignment can easily induce
higher order effects in proton spectra of carbohydrates, which
typically show little chemical shift dispersion. This can compro-
mise the measurement of all types of RDCs. On the other hand,
nDHH coupling constants are larger, which allows the use of a
very weak alignment. We have therefore adapted this approach
and supplemented 1DCH with nDHH coupling constants.

We have recently developed a suite of NMR experiments for
the accurate measurement of small proton–proton RDCs from
highly overlapped proton spectra and weakly aligned samples
(Jin L et al. 2007). The reader is referred to the original ref-
erences for their full description. In short, these methods are
based on the selective 1D directed-COSY experiment (Pham
et al. 2002, 2004) and provide coupling constants through ﬁt-
ting of signal intensities measured in a series of experiments.
Their key feature is the ability to excite selectively a single
proton resonance from severely overlapping spectra via the use
of double-selective HOHAHA (Konrat et al. 1991) or gradient-
enhanced, chemical shift-selective ﬁlters (Robinson et al. 2004)
as illustrated in Figure 4.

Table II summarizes experimental 1DHH and 1DCH coupling
constants of I measured in neutral aligning media (Ruckert and
Otting 2000). The latter were determined from the F2 dimen-
sion of 1H-coupled nonrefocused 1H-13C HSQC spectra. The
measured RDCs were validated using the rigid monosaccharide

rings A and C. For this purpose, ab initio disaccharide structures,
IdoA2S-GlcNS,6S-OMe and GlcNS,6S-IdoA2S-Ome repre-
senting BA and CB fragments of I, were used. Five 1DCH and
four 3DHH coupling constants for either the A or C ring were used
to calculate separately the order tensors via the singular value
decomposition method (Losonczi et al. 1999). The theoretical

RDCs were then back calculated using REDCAT (Valafar and
Prestegard 2004). These calculations were performed for both
1C4 and 2So conformations of the B ring BA and CB disaccha-
rides. A comparison of the theoretical and experimental RDCs
(Table III) showed a very good agreement indicating a high ac-
curacy of the measured coupling constants. For both BA and

CB disaccharides, a better agreement between the theoretical
and experimental RDCs was obtained when the iduronic ring
was in the 1C4 conformation. In the case of the CB disaccha-
ride, this agreement was much better. From now on, we will
therefore focus on the disaccharides with this conformation of
ring B, although the conclusions presented below were the same
when the 2So conformers were analyzed.
Inspection of the experimental 1DCH coupling constants of
rings C and A showed their ratio to be close to 2:−1. This
suggested that the orientation of CH vectors of the two rings
is approximately parallel and perpendicular with regard to the
z-axis of the principal axis frame (PAF) of the respective order
tensor. This was conﬁrmed through the analysis of the PAF sys-
tems of rings A and C. Four axial CH bonds of ring A in the

disaccharide BA were found to be oriented at angles 88
relative to Szz- and Syy-axes of the order tensor,
and 7.5
◦ ± 5
◦
while for ring C in the disaccharide CB these were at 31
and 81
. An implication of these observations is that the
CH bonds of rings A and C in I are approximately perpendicular
to each other. This statement assumes that a single-order tensor
can be used to characterize the alignment of I. In order to test
this assumption, the Eigen values of the order matrix of ring A
in the BA disaccharide (1.33 × 10
−4, −4.15 ×

Szz and Syy in both cases (note that these components therefore
occasionally swap) indicate that both order tensors can be char-
acterized as oblate. The alignment of ring A is 19% weaker,
which could be attributed to the fact that this is the terminal,
reducing monosaccharide of I. In order to detect the presence of
conformational averaging, Tian et al. (2001) have introduced the
generalized degree of order (GDO). A large difference between
GDOs of two rigid fragments of a molecule indicates confor-
mational ﬂexibility. In our study, the GDOs of rings A and C
are 1.53 × 10
−4 for 1C4 conformers of ring B.
Even closer agreement (GDO = 1.47 × 10
−4)
was observed for 2So conformation of the B ring. A similar
difference in GDO of around 20% has been interpreted as origi-
nating from a limited relative movement of two monosaccharide
rings in a trimannoside (Tian et al. 2001). Adopting this assump-
tion, we postulated that the relative orientation of rings A and
C is not affected signiﬁcantly by the presence of the conforma-
tional ﬂexibility of the B ring, and we performed restrained MD
simulations of I using RDCs of both rings simultaneously as
restraints.

structures. Here, they are used as experimental restraints during
the AMBER molecular dynamics while the order tensor pa-
rameters are allowed to ﬂoat. RDCs of ring B are not included
as restraints; they are merely calculated for every point of the
MD trajectory and their values are compared with experimen-
tal data. During the RDC-restrained MD, and similarly to the
unrestrained MD, rings A and C were stable in their 4C1 con-
formations, while ring B showed transitions between the 1C4
and 2So forms. The effect of RDCs on the MD simulation was
assessed by calculating rmsds of ring atoms of monosaccharides
A, B, and C. The magnitude of rmsd ﬂuctuations (Figure 2B)
was identical to those observed in the unrestrained MD simu-
lations (Figure 2A) indicating that the inclusion of RDCs did
not destabilize the structures. RDCs of ring A showed smaller
rmsds (5% for 1DCH and 19% for 3DHH) than those of ring C
(10% for 1DCH and 24% for 3DHH) (Figure 5); in either case,
the rmsds did not depend on the state of the B ring.

In order to analyze the order tensor parameters, the struc-
tures were divided into two groups depending on the confor-
mation of ring B and their diagonalized order tensors were
inspected. The average Saupe matrix of the 1C4 forms was
found to have principal axis components: Szz = 1.44e-04,
Syy = 1.36e-04, Sxx = −0.70e-05, and (GDO = 1.62e-04),
while the 2So form gave Szz = 1.58e-04, Syy = 1.43e-04, and
Sxx = −1.44e-05 (GDO = 1.74e-04). The two largest compo-
nents of these tensors, Szz and Syy, differ by less than 10%,
which caused their occasional swapping, seen in particular for
the B ring in the 1C4 conformer. Importantly, there is <10%
difference between the Szz (Syy) values of the two groups dif-
fering in the conformations of the B ring; their GDOs are also
very similar (<7% difference). In addition, the orientation of
the principal axes of the two tensors was very similar. Figure 6
shows that Szz is parallel to the long axis of the trisaccharide
fragment CBA of I. The large Syy component arises due to the
presence of bulky sulfate groups and the fact that the D ring is

positioned at an acute angle to the Szz-axis. The smallest com-
ponent, Sxx, is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the
other two. Although there is 100% difference between the two
forms of the B ring, this can easily be a result of small changes
in the average orientation of some sulfate groups.

Eight RDCs of ring B, which were not used as structural
restraints during MD, were then back calculated using MD
structures. Four of them were practically identical between the
two sets of molecules differing in the conformation of the B
ring; the MD trajectories of the remaining RDCs are shown in
Figure 7. Our MD simulations are too short to allow for a reliable
calculation of the average theoretical RDCs by using weighted
averages of the two forms. Instead, least-square analysis was
performed using the average theoretical RDCs of the individual
conformers (Table IV). This yielded the best ﬁt with the ex-
perimental data for 82% of the 1C4 and 18% of the 2So forms,
which is remarkably similar to the results of the analysis of
the proton–proton scalar couplings of ring B (76% and 24%,
respectively).

RDC analysis of a heparin U-tetrasaccharide

Veriﬁcation of RDC-restrained MD structures using
interglycosidic 3JCH coupling constants of I
Interglycosidic dihedral angles can be conveniently probed by
three bond proton–carbon coupling constants. The correspond-
ing Karplus curve, relating J couplings to dihedral angles, has
been parameterized for glycosidic linkages of carbohydrates
(Tvaroˇska et al. 1989). The dihedral angles that satisfy experi-
mental J couplings are not unique due to the 4-fold degeneracy
of the Karplus curve. However, relatively large measured cou-
pling constants (Table V) immediately indicate that the average
absolute dihedral angles they report on are small (quadrants I
and IV) or large (quadrants II and III) angles. The latter possibil-
ity could be eliminated as there is no experimental evidence for
the existence of anticonformer for either  or  dihedral angle
in heparin structures. Taking into account NOESY data (data not
shown) and the MD simulation, three out of the four angles can
therefore be interpreted unambiguously, leaving BA ambigu-
ous between the ﬁrst and the fourth quadrant. Table V shows the
dihedral angles derived from the experimental 3JCH coupling
constants; their values are within ± 15
◦
of the average dihedral
angles obtained for both tetrasaccharides containing the B ring in
either 1C4 or 2So conformation. Assuming a 4:1 ratio of the 1C4
and 2So conformers, the average values of 3JCH coupling con-
stants were calculated using the average dihedral angles of each
form obtained in restrained MD simulations (Table VI). The
rmsd between the measured and calculated values was 0.49 Hz
indicating a good agreement between dihedral angles in RDC-
restrained MD structures and J-based dihedral angles.

Discussion

The order tensor deﬁning the direction and the strength of the
alignment is required for the interpretation of RDCs. If struc-
tures of the studied compound are available, the order tensor can
be obtained using a steric model (Almond et al. 2001) or mass
distribution (Lycknert et al 2001; Azurmendi and Bush 2002).
Starting from NOE-restrained structure, the latter approach was
recently used to analyze the conformation of a dermatan sulfate
tetrasaccharide (Silipo et al. 2008). Linearly averaged RDCs
calculated for every frame of MD simulations were compared
with the experimental values and showed a good agreement.

Alternatively, the tensor parameters can be obtained by ana-
lyzing RDCs without the need for an initial molecular model.
This requires more RDCs to be measured, typically ﬁve to ten
for any rigid part of the molecule. In our work, we have sup-
plemented the standard 1DCH by 3DHH coupling constants; the
latter type was obtained by 1D intensity-based methods. Alto-
gether 18 RDCs, 9 per each ring were used. They sampled 12
independent orientations: two and four described by 1DCH and
3DHH couplings per ring, respectively. We have analyzed these
RDCs using the singular value decomposition (Losonczi et al.
1999) method in two different ways. Firstly, by focusing sepa-
rately on the rigid A and C rings of I and using disaccharides
related to BA and CB fragments of I. A major conclusion of this
analysis was a relative agreement between the GDO parameters
of the order tensors of rings A and C that allowed us to suggest
that one order tensor can be used to describe the alignment of
I. Based on this premise, we were able to show that the relative
orientation of rings A and C is such that their CH bonds are
approximately perpendicular.

Any conformational changes of the trisaccharide fragment
CBA during the restrained MD simulations will affect the di-
hedral angles along CB and BA glycosidic linkages (Figure 3C
and D). Table V shows that the differences between the average
values of  and  angles corresponding to two forms of ring B
◦
are less than 15
– a value comparable to the natural ﬂuctuations
of these parameters. This also illustrates that the conformational
space sampled during MD simulations is smaller than observed
for the unrestrained MD dynamics (cf. Figure 3A and B) and also
implies that the overall shape of I is not affected signiﬁcantly
by the conformational change of ring B.

One observation made during this analysis deserves a brief
discussion. According to the analysis of 3JHH coupling con-
stants, the B ring of I exists mainly (76%) in 1C4 conformation.
The analysis of RDCs of rings A and C using disaccharides
BA and CB showed better agreement with the experimental
data when ring B was in the 1C4 conformation. It is therefore
tempting to suggest that RDCs of rigid rings A or C reﬂect the
conformational state of the B ring. However, this might be an
over interpretation of our data. First, we are using methylated
disaccharide structures to interpret RDCs of monosaccharide
rings of I, i.e., we are not taking into account possible effects of
the third carbohydrate ring. Second, the structures of the BA and
CB disaccharides were calculated in an isolated state and, as we
have shown previously (Pham et al. 2004), RDCs are extremely
sensitive to small changes in dihedral and bond angles and the
different environments could therefore play a role. Nevertheless,
a proposition that the type or a conformation of the neighboring
ring can affect the monosaccharide ring geometry which could
be probed by RDCs is intriguing and warrants further investi-
gation using simpler systems. This suggestion is supported by
theoretical data indicating that inﬂuence of the IdoA2S residue
on the geometry of neighboring GlcNS residues could be im-
portant (Hricov´ıni et al. 2007).

We performed restrained MD simulations of I using RDCs
of rings A and C simultaneously as restraints. The resulting
structures were then used to back calculate RDCs for the ﬂexible
B ring in both of its conformations. The relative amounts of 1C4
and 2So forms deduced from the back-calculated RDCs agreed
well with the results of the analysis of the proton–proton scalar
couplings of ring B.

The experimental RDCs reﬂect the dynamics of glycosidic
linkages, internal dynamics of rings B and D, as well as any
possible accompanying changes of the order tensor. They there-
fore mirror a highly complex system. Due to the long time scale
of NMR measurements, we can be conﬁdent that the sampling
of these RDCs was comprehensive. While the ﬂuctuations of
the glycosidic linkages are fast, the B ring is only slowly in-
terconverting between its two forms, 1C4 and 2So, and on a
picosecond time scale exists in a particular conformation. This
means that average RDCs were used here to reﬁne immediate
conformations of I during MD. Meaningful results are there-
fore only obtained if the order tensor is largely independent of
the complex dynamics experienced by the U-tetrasaccharide.

1192

This assumption was based on the analysis of two disaccharide
fragments showing similar GDOs for both conformations of the
B ring.

In order to verify this assumption, albeit in an indirect way,
we need another experimental parameter. This was provided
by interglycosidic 3JCH coupling constants, measured for the
ﬁrst time on a heparin oligosaccharide. Their relatively large
values (Table VI) immediately indicated that the corresponding
dihedral angles are small, which is in agreement with the results
of our restrained MD simulations. We used a 4:1 ratio of 1C4
and 2So conformers of ring B, as determined by the analysis of
proton–proton scalar coupling constants, and calculated the 3JCH
coupling constants based on RDC-restrained MD structures.
The obtained rmsd between the theoretical and experimental
coupling constants of 0.49 Hz indicated a good agreement with
the experimental data.

As stated in the Introduction, the structure of heparin and
heparin oligosaccharides has been investigated in the past by
standard NMR techniques. When making a comparison with
our studies, it should be kept in mind that none of the cited work
has carried out conformational analysis in the presence of Ca2+
,
which could be a source of discrepancies. U-tetrasaccharide
I was studied previously using NOESY spectroscopy and the
authors (Mikhailov et al. 1996) have reported the interglyco-
sidic dihedral angles of their ﬁnal structure. The 3JCH coupling
constants for this structure showed rmsd of 1.05 Hz to our
experimental values (Table VI). This larger rmsd is a direct con-
sequence of more acute dihedral angles (Table V) found by the
previous study based on 1H-1H NOESY data only.

◦ ± 9.0 and 86

Our solution structures of I can also be compared with the
heparin structure (Mulloy et al. 1993). The reported NOE- and
MD-based structure of a dodecasaccharide shows angles be-
tween the CH vectors of pairs of consecutive glucosamine rings
◦ ± 5.9 for 1C4 and 2So conformation of
of 111
IdoA2S, respectively. For 1C4 conformation, this agrees very
◦
◦
well with our RDC-based solution structure (118
) while a 25
◦
difference was found for the 2So conformation of ring B (111
).
This could be due to much shorter fragment approximating the
terminal tetrasaccharide of heparin used in our study. We can
also compare interglycosidic dihedral angles of both structures
(Table V). Here, all the dihedral angles are within one rmsd
of our restrained MD structures, with an exception of CB
glycosidic linkage. The theoretical 3JCH coupling constants,

calculated as weighted averages of ring B 1C4 and 2So con-
formers using the heparin structure (Mulloy et al. 1993), show
rmsd of 0.79 Hz from our experimental values, i.e., larger than
for our RDC-restrained MD structures (rmsd of 0.49 Hz). Again,
this difference could be attributed to the end effects of I that are
diluted in heparin dodecasaccharide. Nevertheless, the observed
values indicate that heparin helix recently also found through
NOE and MD investigation of 13C-labeled heparin (Zhang et al.
2008) is already starting to form in the fully sulfated heparin
U-tetrasaccharide I.

Table V also includes the dihedral angles reported for an X-ray
structure of I, containing the iduronic acid in 1C4 conformation,
in complex with the basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (Faham et al.
1996). While a good agreement was obtained for the dihedral
◦
angles along the CB glycosidic linkage, differences of up to 30
were observed for the BA linkage (Table V). This is reﬂected
in a large rmsd (1.21 Hz) for the corresponding 3JCH coupling
constants reported in Table VI. This comparison should be taken
with caution as average values reﬂecting the presence of two
forms in solution are compared here with only one conformer
(1C4) of I observed in the solid state, which in addition is in
complex with protein.

As 3JCH coupling constants were not used during the structure
reﬁnement, they represent an experimental parameter that may
be used to verify our structure and therefore justify the assump-
tions that underline our analysis of RDCs. However, we would
like to emphasize that this reasoning is not strictly consequen-
tial. All we can conclude from this analysis is that the structures
obtained using RDC-restrained MD simulations reproduce well
the experimental inter-glycosidic 3JCH coupling constants.

Although showing some differences in interglycosidic dihe-
dral angles to our structure of I that were veriﬁed by inter-
glycosidic 3JCH coupling constants, previous investigations of
heparin (Mulloy et al. 1993) and its oligosaccharides (Ferro et al.
1986; Mikhailov et al. 1996, 1997; de Paz et al. 2001) using 1H-
1H NOESY spectroscopy and force ﬁeld calculations concluded
that the ﬂexibility of the IdoA has only a limited effect on the
overall shape of heparin. Our conclusions based on the analysis
of additional NMR parameters, inter-glycosidic 3JCH coupling
constants and RDCs in particular, support these ﬁndings. The
nature of RDCs makes this NMR parameter particularly suit-
able for the study of mutual orientation of remote molecular
fragments providing superior information to NOE data. This is
the main contribution of this work. From the structural biology
point of view, enhancement of the protein binding properties of
IdoA containing GAGs acts through more ﬂexible orientation
of sulfate groups, rather than signiﬁcantly affecting the confor-
mation of glycosidic linkages. At the same time however, the
overall shape of the heparin molecules is not changing signiﬁ-
cantly, as shown by similar order parameters irrespective of the
conformation of the internal IdoA.

Conclusion

We have investigated the structure of a fully sulfated, heparin-
derived U-tetrasaccharide using NMR spectroscopy and MD
simulations. Our analysis of RDCs showed that the inter-
conversion of the iduronic acid between its 1C4 and 2So forms
has only modest effect on the overall shape of the molecule.
This conclusion is born out of our observation that the average

RDC analysis of a heparin U-tetrasaccharide

RDCs of the two rigid carbohydrate rings surrounding the ﬂex-
ible iduronic acid were equally well reproduced using similar
order tensors calculated for the two IdoA conformations. Fol-
lowing RDC-restrained MD simulations obtained using a single
order tensor produced the ﬁnal structures of I. The ratios of 1C4
and 2So forms of the iduronic acid derived using 3JHH and RDC
were practically identical. The RDC-restrained structures were
validated by the interglycosidic 3JCH coupling constants. Ex-
perimentally determined interglycosidic dihedral angles of the
terminal trisaccharide fragment indicate that the heparin helix
already starts forming in this minimal structure. Thus, by using
RDCs and interglycosidic coupling constants, the two parame-
ters previously not applied to the study of heparin, our inves-
tigation conﬁrmed the limited effect of the ﬂexibility of IdoA
on the overall shape of heparin molecule. Our work therefore
demonstrates the effectiveness of the methods for the measure-
ment and analysis of RDCs in the conformational analysis of
glycosaminoglycans.

Material and methods

Preparation of fully heparin-derived U-tetrasaccharide I
The heparin U-tetrasaccharide (Figure 1) was prepared by par-
tial enzymatic digestion of low-molecular-weight heparin (In-
nohep; Leo Laboratories, Princes Risborough, UK, with hep-
arinase I; Grampian Enzymes, Orkney, UK). The digest was
resolved into its constituent oligosaccharide size fractions by
gel-ﬁltration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P10 (Bio-Rad Lab-
oratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK) column (2.5× 120 cm) eluted
with 0.25 M NH4HCO3 at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL/h. The elution
proﬁle was monitored by UV absorption at 232 nm, speciﬁc to
the unsaturated nonreducing ends of the oligosaccharides intro-
duced by the lyase action of the enzyme. The tetrasaccharide
fractions were pooled, freeze-dried twice, desalted on PD-10
columns (Amersham Biosciences Ltd, Chalfont St. Giles, UK)
and then dried. The tetrasaccharide fractions were resolved into
their constituent species by strong anion-exchange HPLC chro-
matography on an IonPac AS17 column (0.4 × 25 cm; Dionex,
Camberley, UK). After a brief wash with water (pH 3.5), the
column was eluted with a 60 mL linear gradient of 0–1.0 M
NaCl, pH 3.5, at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min with in line monitoring
of UV absorption at 232 nm. U-tetrasaccharide eluted as the
last fraction; its structure was identiﬁed as described previously
(Jin et al. 2005).

Preparation of isotropic and aligned samples for NMR
Five hundred ﬁfty micrograms of I was dissolved in 0.5 mL
deuterium oxide (D2O >99.96%) and lyophilized to remove ex-
changeable protons. The powder was then redissolved in 320 μL
D2O, which contained CaCl2 corresponding to a 4-fold molar
access with regard to I. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 by adding
NaOH dissolved in D2O. A 5 mm Shigemi tube with or without
plunger was used for isotropic and aligned samples, respec-
tively. The C12E5/hexanol medium (Ruckert and Otting 2000)
with r = 0.9 and wt% = 3.7% was used for the aligned sample
of I. The composition of the mixture was 18.6 μL C12E5, 6.2 μL
hexanol, and 430 μL D2O. The splitting of the deuterium signal
◦
was 22.5 Hz at 25

C.

Measurements of 1DCH and 3DHH coupling constants
NMR experiments were performed on a 600 or 800 MHz Bruker
Advance spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm cryoprobe with
inverse geometry and z-gradients. RDCs were calculated as a
difference between the splittings observed in the isotropic and
aligned samples determined using identical NMR experiments
acquired under the same conditions. Nonrefocused 2D 1H-13C
HSQC spectra were acquired without decoupling and refocus-
ing in the directly detected dimension. Acquisition times of
both isotropic and aligned samples in t1 and t2 were 63.6 and
341 ms, respectively; the total experimental times were 62.5 and
45.5 h, respectively. SPFGSE-COSY, CSSF-COSY, and double-
selective HOHAHA-COSY spectra, acquired using the parame-
ters described elsewhere (Jin et al. 2007) were used for the mea-
surement of 1H-1H scalar and dipolar coupling constants. The
spectra of the isotropic sample were normally acquired using
80 scans per increment, while those of the aligned sample were
recorded using 200 scans. Twenty to thirty millisecond Gaus-
sian pulses were used to selectively invert proton resonances.
CSSF-COSY spectra were typically acquired using eight 10 ms
CSSF increments; 30–45 ms Gaussian pulses were used during
the CSSF and also during the COSY part.

DFT calculations of disaccharide fragments
The geometry of heparin disaccharides CB (GlcNS,6S-IdoA2S-
OMe) and BA (IdoA2S-GlcNS,6S-OMe) has been optimized
(JAGUAR 1998) using density functional theory (DFT) with
Lee–Young–Parr (B3LYP) (Lee et al. 1988) correlation func-
tional and the 6-311++G
∗∗
basis set. Two conformers (1C4 and
2So) were considered for the IdoA2S residue with the starting
structures obtained previously (Hricov´ıni 2006). The GlcN,6S
residue was in the 4C1 conformation. Geometry optimizations
were obtained with the gradient optimization routine, and the
convergence criteria were set to 1.10

−6.

Free and restrained MD simulations of I using AMBER
U-tetrasaccharide I was built using the atom types contained in
the recently parameterized force ﬁeld (Huige and Altona 1995;
Jin et al. 2005). Partial atom charges were calculated with the
RESP (Restrained ElectroStatic Potential ﬁt) procedure using
∗
Gaussian98 with the 6-31G
basis set. The single point charge
calculation was carried out with the convergence criteria of
1.00D-02 and 1.00D-04 for the maximal and RMSDs change of
the density matrix elements, respectively. The net charge was
set to −8. Firstly, a simulated annealing procedure was used to
generate low potential energy structures of I. The calculation
was run in vacuum without any solvent or periodic box. In the
initial energy minimization period, the starting conformation
was optimized with a 3 ps steepest descent step followed by a
gradient method of 0.5 ns duration. The optimized structure was
subjected to 30 ps of molecular dynamics at 800 K with con-
straint on the bonds involving H-atoms (SHAKE). The system
was then cooled to 0 K during a period of 10 ps using 10 cool-
ing steps of 80 K in order to freeze out one conformation. This
geometry was then optimized by minimizing the energy in the
same way as the initial energy minimization was carried out.
The ﬁrst candidate conformation was obtained in this way and
used as the input for the next round of the simulated annealing.
The structure with the lowest potential energy from gas phase
simulation was dissolved in a water box for explicit solution

periodical calculation. Before adding the water molecules, eight
sodium ions were added randomly to neutralize the whole unit.
A cubic 40.675 ˚A3 water box with a spacing of 8 ˚A contain-
ing 1938 triangulated 3-point water molecules was generated.
The water box was ﬁrst energy minimized with a tight restraint
on the U-tetrasaccharide I atoms to relax the water molecules.
The whole system was energy minimized without any restraints.
The temperature of the system was then increased from 0 K to
300 K in 2 ps and stabilized at 300 K for 20 ps at a constant vol-
ume with constraint on the bonds involving H-atoms, while the
U-tetrasaccharide molecule was restrained weakly. Another
0.1 ns equilibration molecular dynamic at 300 K and a constant
pressure (1 atm) was simulated without any restraint before the
MD production calculations. Free and RDC-restrained molecu-
lar dynamics were performed at constant pressure (1 atm) and
temperature of 300 K for 4 ns. RDCs of both glucosamine rings
(A and C) of I were used as experimental restraints.
