Candida albicans often resides in the oral cavity of healthy humans as a harmless commensal organism. This
opportunistic fungus can cause significant disease in critically ill patients, such as those undergoing
mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) having compromised local airway defense mechanisms.
The goal of this study was to determine the intra- and inter-patient genetic relationship between strains of
C. albicans recovered from dental plaque, tracheal secretions, and the lower airway by bronchoalveolar lavage
of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Three pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing methods
were used to determine the genetic relatedness of the C. albicans strains,
including electrophoretic
karyotyping (EK) and restriction endonuclease analysis of the genome using SfiI (REAG-S) and BssHII
(REAG-B). The C. albicans isolates from dental plaque and tracheo-bronchial sites from the same patient
were genetically indistinguishable and retained over time, whereas strains from different patients usually
separated into different genotypes. Among the three methods, REAG-B proved to be the most discriminatory
method to differentiate isolates. The finding of genetically similar strains from the oral and tracheo-bronchial
sites from the same patient supports the notion that the oral cavity may serve as an important source for
C. albicans spread to the trachea and lung of mechanically ventilated patients.

C andida albicans is an ubiquitous, dimorphic

commensal yeast (1) that resides in the oral
cavities of most healthy humans (2, 3). However,
in critically ill patients with compromised local airway
defense mechanisms C. albicans may act as an opportu-
nistic fungal pathogen that can cause infections resul-
ting in considerable morbidity and mortality (49). Risk
factors predisposing an ICU patient to increased mucosal
colonization by Candida species include the use of broad-
spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, which upset the
homeostatic balance of the commensal flora. In addition,
intravascular catheters, complex surgical procedures, and

acute renal failure increase the risk of Candida species
infections (8, 10, 11).

For patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, the
endotracheal tube can serve as a conduit for pathogen
transmission to the lower airway (12, 13). While respira-
tory colonization by the yeast form of C. albicans in the
airway is not a good marker for Candida pneumonia in
critically ill patients, it may be a marker for increased risk
of hospital morbidity and mortality (1418). Indeed, it
was shown that increased mortality of suspected ventila-
tor-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients colonized only
by Candida species in respiratory secretions was associated

Molecular epidemiology has been used to analyze
genetic relationships and identify the route of transmis-
sion for C. albicans (26). Methods such as pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), Ca3 fingerprinting, and multi-
locus sequencing typing (MLST) offer high-resolution,
greater stability, and have proved to be more discrimina-
tory than phenotypic methods (27). Contour-clamped
homogenous electrophoresis (CHEF), the most com-
monly used PFGE system, has been successfully applied
as a tool for typing Candida strains (2832). The PFGE
system has been used to electrophoretically karyotype
(EK) yeast through the separation of intact chromosomal
DNA (33), but
it has limitations in its ability to
differentiate C. albicans isolates when compared to
restriction analysis (34). To further delineate strains of
Candida species, restriction endonuclease analysis of the
genome (REAG) using either BssHII or SfiI as the
restriction enzyme has proven to be a reliable method
with high discriminatory abilities (34, 35).

We previously used PFGE to document the genetic
relationships between bacterial respiratory isolates recov-
ered from oral and tracheo-bronchial sites from mech-
anically ventilated patients in the ICU (13). These
patients that were part of a clinical trial assessing the
efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinse in reducing
VAP (36), which postulated that reduction of potential
respiratory pathogens in the mouth would reduce the
incidence VAP. Molecular epidemiology studies were
performed on samples from a subset of these patients
suspected of having VAP who underwent bronchoalveo-
lar lavage (13). Bacterial isolates from dental plaque were
genetically identical to those from bronchoscopic cultures
done at the time of suspected pneumonia. In the current
study, a molecular epidemiology investigation was per-
formed on C. albicans isolates recovered from the same
oral and tracheo-bronchial samples. The aim of this study
was to assess the clonal relatedness of intra- and inter-
patient C. albicans strains from these patients, to docu-
ment the route of transmission to the lower airway,
and to determine an endogenous or exogenous origin of
the strains. Three PFGE-based typing methods, elect-
rophoretic karyotyping (EK), restriction endonuclease

analysis of genome using SfiI (REAG-S), and restriction
endonuclease analysis of genome using BssHII (REAG-
B) were used to genetically analyze each C. albicans
isolate recovered from the supragingival dental plaque
(SG),
tracheal secretions (TS), and bronchoalveolar
lavage (BL) fluids from patients in the ICU undergoing
mechanical ventilation.

Materials and Methods

Study population
The subjects were recruited for a randomized clinical
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00123123) that
tested the effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral
rinse on oral colonization by respiratory pathogens
(13, 37). The University at Buffalo Human Subjects
Institutional Review Board approved the study proto-
col. Patients admitted to Erie County Medical Center
(ECMC)
trauma ICU during 14 February 2005 to
15 May 2006 who were intubated and mechanically
ventilated within 48 h of admission were recruited to be
subjects in this study. All participants or their surrogates
provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria for the
study, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
II score, pneumonia diagnosis criteria, BL sampling,
and oral examination protocols have been previously
described (13, 37).

Oral, tracheal, and lung microbial sampling
Samples were collected from SG and TS every 48 h, and
BL samples were collected as described previously (13).
Samples were immediately transported on ice to the
clinical microbiology laboratory where they were diluted,
plated, and incubated for 72 h at 378C in 5% carbon
dioxide. Growth of target VAP pathogens and C. albicans
was assessed on sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar,
as previously described (13). C. albicans was identified
using standard microbiological methods; the API 20C
(bioMerieux, France) was used for further speciation as
required.

In-gel cell lysis
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed according
to the protocol described previously (38) with minor
modifications. C. albicans isolates were subcultured from
stock cultures to DifcoTM Sabouraud dextrose agar
(Becton Dickinson [BD], Sparks, MD) and incubated
for 48 h at 378C. A single colony was transferred to 4 ml of
YPD broth (1% yeast extract [BD], 1% BactoTM peptone
[BD], and 2% dextrose) and incubated overnight with
constant shaking at 378C. After 14 h of incubation, cells
were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 4 ml of
50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and the optical density measured
at 600 nm. The cell suspension was adjusted to 1.5 at
600 nm with additional 50 mM EDTA to ensure a

similar number of cells per isolate for each lane of the
PFGE gel. Cells were collected from a 1.5 ml aliquot
by centrifugation at top speed for 30 sec. Each cell pellet
was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0,
followed by centrifugation. After aspiration of super-
natant, cells were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0. Lyticase solution was prepared fresh
just prior to use by mixing 1 ml of SCE (1 M sorbitol,
0.1 M sodium citrate, and 60 mM EDTA) solution with
4 ml lyticase (3 mg/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 50 ml
b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Lyticase solution (50 ml)
was added to the cell suspension and mixed immediately
with 250 ml of melted 1% (weight-to-volume) low-melting-
point
(LMP) InCert agarose (Cambrex Bio Science
Rockland, Rockland, ME)
in 0.125 M EDTA, pH
7.0 equilibrated to 558C. Each sample was mixed and
applied to five wells of a disposable plug mold (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA), as per manufacturer’s instructions. After
the plugs were set by placing them at 208C for 5 min,
each set of plugs were extruded into a single 15 ml tube
of freshly prepared EDTA-Tris-b-mercaptoethanol (ETB)
solution (for 10.5 ml ETB: 9 ml 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0; 1 ml
1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; and 0.5 ml b-mercaptoethanol).
Tubes were incubated horizontally at 378C with gentle
rotation for a minimum of 4 h. ETB solution was removed
and the plugs were rinsed twice with 5 ml of 50 mM
EDTA. To each tube of five plugs, 2.5 ml proteinase K
solution (for 10 ml proteinase K solution: 9 ml 0.5 M
EDTA, pH 8.0; 1 ml 10% laurylsarcosine in 0.5 M
EDTA; 0.1 mg RNase A, 10 ml of 10 mg/ml RNase
solution); and 32 mg (32 ml of 1 mg/ml proteinase K
[Sigma] solution) were added. The tubes were placed
horizontally and rotated at 378C for at least 6 h. After
removing the proteinase solution, the plugs were rinsed
with 5 ml of 50 mM EDTA, and incubated in 34 ml
1X TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer
for 1 h with gentle agitation. The plugs were used
immediately or stored in 1 ml of storage solution (for
10 ml: 1 ml 1 M Tris-HCl and 9 ml 0.5 M EDTA,
pH 8.0) at 48C. For EK, plugs were used as is without
restriction enzyme digestion.

In-plug restriction enzyme digestion
If the plugs containing genomic DNA were in storage
solution, one plug was removed and placed in a micro-
centrifuge tube and washed twice by adding 1 ml of 1X
TE buffer, and incubating for 30 min at room tempera-
ture. For SfiI digestion, the plug was transferred to
a microcentrifuge tube containing 500 mL of buffer 2
(50 mM NaCl, 10 mMTris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
dithiothreitol), and incubated on ice for 30 min. After
aspirating the buffer, the plug was placed in 160 mL
(4X plug volume) of buffer 2 containing 20 U SfiI and
2 mL BSA (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), and
incubated overnight at 508C. For BssHII digestion, the

plug was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing
500 ml of buffer 3 (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl,
10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol), and incubated on
ice for 30 min. After aspirating buffer, the plug was
placed in 160 ml of buffer 3 containing 4 U of BssHII
(New England BioLabs), and incubated overnight at
508C. Following aspiration, each plug was soaked for 1 h
at room temperature in 1 ml 1X TE to remove buffer
salts. The plugs were then placed into the agarose gel
wells for electrophoresis.

PFGE
DNA was recovered from each C. albicans isolate once
and subjected to each of the PFGE methods described.
Electrophoresis was performed with contour-clamped
homogenous electric field apparatus (CHEF DR-II;
Bio-Rad). PFGE analysis was performed as described
(38) with minor modifications. For electrophoretic kar-
the following parameters were used:
yotyping (EK)
temperature 148C, 4 V/cm
switch time 90325 sec,
in 1% agarose gel
(SeaKem GTG agarose; FMC)
with 0.5X TBE (1:20 dilution of 10X TBE stock,
890 mM Tris base, 890 mM boric acid, 20 mM EDTA,
pH 8) for 48 h. For restriction endonuclease analysis of
genomic DNA using SfiI (REAG-S) and BssHII (REAG-
B), the switch time was 550 sec, temperature 148C, 6 V/
cm in 1% agarose gel (SeaKem GTG agarose; Cambrex
Bio Science Rockland) with 0.5X TBE for 20 h. After
electrophoresis, gels were stained in ethidium bromide
solution for 30 min and destained with distilled water.
Gels were photographed using AlphaEase FC and Alpha-
Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). For all EK
gels, Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA was included as a
size marker. For all REAG-S and REAG-B, l DNA
ladder (Bio-Rad) was included as the size marker. C.
albicans SC 5314 (ATCC MYA-2876), used as a reference
strain, was provided by Dr. Mira Edgerton.

Band pattern analysis and interpretation
Dendrogram analysis was performed with BioNumerics
software (Applied Maths, Austin, TX). The software
assigned bands automatically. Each gel was normalized
to respective size markers (S. cerevisiae for EK, l DNA
ladder for REAGs). The position tolerance and optimiza-
tion was 1 and 3%, respectively, as used in previous
study (35). The unweighted pair group method using
arithmetic averages (UPGMA) was used to construct
the phylogenetic trees. Dice coefficients were used to
calculate the similarity percentage of the band patterns.
The isolates were grouped into three categories: geneti-
cally identical when the number and size of the bands
matched perfectly (similarity percentage 100%), geneti-
cally related (genetically similar) when the bands had
minor differences (similarity percentage ]95%, but
less than 100%), and genetically unrelated (genetically

Results

Colonization of patients
Sixty-two of 96 (65.6%) subjects studied were colonized
by Candida species in at least one site; 54 (87.1%) of
isolates were identified as C. albicans. In colonized
patients who were sampled up to day 10, detection of
Candida species increased from 34.4% on day 0 to 84%
by day 10 or later. The number of days after ICU
admission that C. albicans was first isolated ranged from
day zero (day of
to 18 days after
admission.

the admission)

This study focused on C. albicans strains isolated from
a subset of patients with suspected pneumonia who
underwent BL. Of
the 30 patients undergoing BL,
20 patients harbored C. albicans in at least one site:
19 (63.3%) were colonized orally, 16 (53.3%) colonized
in the trachea, and 2 (6.7%) were colonized in the BL.
Two additional mechanically ventilated patients (ID nos.
45 and 74), also colonized with C. albicans, but not
undergoing BL were also screened for strain comparison.
A total of 50 isolates from these 22 patients were analyzed
by PFGE. The source of the isolates was as follows:
27 from SG, 21 from TS, and 2 from BL. Among the
22 patients, C. albicans was recovered from one site in
five patients, two sites in 15 patients, and three sites in
two patients. Of the 17 patients who harbored isolates
from more than one site, C. albicans was recovered
concurrently from SG and TS in nine patients, from SG
and subsequently in TS in seven patients, and from TS
prior to SG and BL from patient four only. In patients
who harbored C. albicans at all three sites, VAP bacterial
pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and
Klebsiella pneumoniae) were co-cultured in the BL from
patient 41, and normal oral
flora (alpha hemolytic
streptococci, diphtheroids, and coagulase negative sta-
phylococcus) from patient four. The same microbial flora
was recovered from all three sites in these patients,
suggesting that the route of transmission was from the
mouth to the lower airway.

PFGE analysis of the isolates
Regardless of the PFGE method used, the band pattern
of the SG isolate from patient 76 was very different from
the TS isolate, which was very similar to the other
isolates. It was later discovered that this SG isolate was
actually Candida glabrata identified by carbohydrate
assimilation assays (API 20C). Another 76 SG isolate
from the same day, identified as C. albicans, was not
analyzed. Since the focus of this study was C. albicans,
this isolate was excluded from subsequent analyses.

Electrophoretic karyotyping (EK) of chromosomal
DNA (Fig. 1) from the C. albicans isolates generated
6 to 10 bands (mean, 8) from the isolates and 8 bands
from the control strain SC5314. Analysis of the EK
patterns yielded 17 karyotypes from the 49 isolates
obtained from 22 patients, ranging in similarity from
47.5 to 100%.

In comparison, restriction endonuclease analysis of
the genome (REAG) from the 49 isolates of 22 patients
yielded 24 patterns after digestion with SfiI (Fig. 2)
and 25 patterns after digestion with BssHII (Fig. 3).
The similarity percentage ranged from 62 to 100% for
REAG-S and 66 to 100% for REAG-B. The enzyme SfiI
cuts in all Major Repeat Sequences (MRS) and the 13
base pair restriction site (5?-GGCCNNNNNGGCC-3).
The enzyme BssHII cuts DNA in the six base pair
restriction site (5?-GCGCGC-3?). Digesting an isolate
with REAG-B generally generated more bands than
REAG-S, thus increasing discriminatory power.

Intra-patient PFGE analysis
By the EK method (Fig. 1), concurrent or sequential
i.e. those from different sites on
C. albicans isolates,
the same day and/or different days, were identical
in
13 of 14 (92.9%). For patient 89, the similarity percentage
was 96%, indicating that though the isolates may not
be a perfect match they are considered genetically rela-
ted. Similar results were obtained by the REAG-S
method (Fig. 2),
isolates from 12 patients were
identical and the isolates from patients 30 and 89 though
not identical were genetically related. However, more
diversity was observed using the REAG-B method
(Fig. 3). Multiple concurrent or sequential isolates from
11 of 14 (78.6%)
individual patients had identical
REAG-B band patterns. Nonetheless,
the similarity
percentages of the remaining isolates were 95%, and
thus considered to be genetically related. These data

grouped into one type. Patients 41, 70, and 76 (TS only)

89 were grouped into another EK type.

strains from patients 88 and 89. The high percentage
of similarity values of both REAG-S and REAG-B for
these strains supported these groupings (Table 1). A
plausible explanation for these two instances of different
patients having a high percentage of similarity values
would be patient-to-patient transmission or environment-
to-patient contamination. Potentially epidemiologically
related patients 15 and 24 were in the ICU within the
same month and there was an overlap in the ICU stay for
patients 88 and 89.

On the other hand, strains of patients 1, 15, and
21 should not have been grouped together, as well as
those from patients 41, 70, and 76 (TS) (Table 1). These
incorrect groupings occurred due to the low number
of bands (6 to 10) resolved by the EK method in this
study. The discriminatory ability of the EK method is
insufficient when PFGE resolves less than 10 distinct
bands (40). REAG-S and REAG-B methods were able to
discriminate the differences in these strains, as the aver-
age number of bands resolved by the two methods was
17 and 26, respectively. The discriminatory abilities of
REAG-S and REAG-B supported our finding that
most
separated into
different groups, except for the two instances where
possible patient-to-patient transmission or environment-
to-patient contamination are suspected.

Discussion
C. albicans, a commensal organism, can also act as
an opportunistic pathogen in high-risk individuals such
as the ICU patient. In the present study, C. albicans
colonization was examined in 22 of 96 mechanically
ventilated ICU patients. This yeast was harbored in the
mouth of 19 patients, in the trachea of 17 patients, and

in the lung of 2 patients. In the present and previous
studies (35), the genotype of most isolates was clonal
and patient-specific. Among the 22 patients examined
in this study, 12 patients harbored the yeast in two sites,
while 2 patients had the yeast in all three sites. Of the
14 patients analyzed with isolates from two or more sites,
12 patients had genetically identical
isolates and one
patient had closely related isolates.

The endotracheal tube in mechanically ventilated ICU
patients impairs local defense mechanisms and facilitates
the passage of C. albicans from the mouth or stomach
into the lower airway. As a normal constituent of the
normal oral flora in many healthy humans, C. albicans
may be commonly found in the mouth and the trachea
of patients. But the low frequency of this species in the
lung (2/20 BL or 10% patients in this study) indicates
that host defense mechanisms limit its colonization of
the lower airway. The artificial surface of the catheter
bypasses anatomic barriers and facilitates the transport
of the pathogen from the oral cavity to the trachea and
to the lungs. A previous study (12) found that the
endotracheal tube can serve as a reservoir for pathogens
in VAP patients and can facilitate the transport of
pathogens to the lungs. Concordant with these findings,
in patients 4 and 41, the bacterial strains co-cultured
with the C. albicans from the bronchoalveolar lavage were
also present in the mouth and tracheal secretions. While
we cannot rule out the stomach as the source of the
C. albicans isolates, based on our molecular epidemiology
data, the tracheo-bronchial isolates of the same genotype
are also found in the mouth. This is finding concurs with
several previous investigations of microbial colonization
patterns in mechanically ventilated patients (4143).

Patient isolates recovered from different sites and/
or from multiple days usually shared the same clonal
ancestry, yet may not be perfect matches. In this study, in
3 of 22 patients (13.6%) minor differences in the band
patterns were observed, despite the same apparent clonal
origin of the strains. These differences can be attributed to
microevolution (44, 45). This low rate of microevolution
may be ascribed to the duration of colonization and the
genetic stability of the strain in the patient’s environment.
In a previous study from Shin and colleagues (44), a
similar low rate of microevolution of C. albicans in
ICU patients was described, which was attributed to
insufficient time for strains to diversify. However, a more
discriminatory method such as MLST may be necessary to
better clarify microevolution of individual isolates, which
is beyond the scope of this paper.

Comparison of

the strains from different patients
indicates that there may be a possibility of acquisition
of the organism from the environment after admission to
the hospital. As in previous studies (34, 46), PFGE typing
methods may be used to detect nosocomial transmission.
In the current study, most strains were patient-specific,

indicating an endogenous origin of the strains. But in
some cases, strains may have been transmitted exogen-
ously through patient-to-patient transmission or environ-
ment-to-patient contamination. Further study using a
more discriminatory molecular typing method, along
with environmental samples, may be required to validate
exogenous transmission.

Among the three PFGE typing methods, electrop-
horetic karyotyping (EK) was the least discriminating
method. Strains from different individuals appear to share
identical EK profiles, which upon examination using
other methods revealed otherwise. On the other hand,
REAG-B proved to be the most discriminatory method,
as in other studies using PFGE (35, 46). Despite the
most discriminatory nature of this method, REAG-B
proved to be the most time consuming in underscoring the
bands. Other alternative methods, such as MLST have
been shown to be more discriminatory for C. albicans, but
not other Candida species (4749). However, we have
shown that PFGE could easily demonstrate inter-patient
strain diversity.

In summary, these data indicate that dental plaque
can be an important source of C. albicans and that
mechanical ventilation may facilitate C. albicans coloni-
zation of the lower airway. While there is the possibility
of nosocomial transmission in some cases, most oral
and airway isolates are genetically indistinguishable
within a patient and are retained over time.
