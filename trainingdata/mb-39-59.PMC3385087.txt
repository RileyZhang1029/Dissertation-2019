One  new  species  of  the  genus  Euphoriomyces  was  collected  on  Scaphisoma  rufum  Achard  (Scaphidiidae)  in  South  Korea.
Euphoriomyces  chaekyui  sp.  nov.  is  unique  in  having  a  single  terminal  phialide  shaped  an  elongated  cylindrical  form  on  the
distal  portion  of  the  main  axis.

So  far  15  species  of  the  genus  Euphoriomyces  have  been
described  [1-9].  In  this  paper,  one  new  species  of  the
genus Euphoriomyces from  Korea is reported  and described.
This  new  Euphoriomyces  species  does  not  appear  to  be
closely related to any of the described species.

Thallus  hyaline  yellowish.  Total  length  to  the  top  of
perithecium  68~70 µm.  Receptacle  consists  of  the  basal
and  distal  portions  (main  axes),  51 × 12~12 × 18 µm;  basal
portion  composed  of  three  superposed  cells,  15~20 ×
12~18 µm;  cell  I  tapering  gradually  towards  the  foot,
gradually  becoming  broader  towards  the  distal  portion;
cell  II  isodiametric,  about  2.5~3  times  broader  than  long;
cell III larger and broader than the others, over three times
broader than long; distal portion (main axes) composed of
7  layers,  the  third  and  fourth  layers  consist  of  two  cells,
bearing  a  terminal  phialide  shaped  an  elongated  cylindri-
cal  form  on  the  distal  portion  of  main  axes,  36~69 × 7~
10 µm.

Perithecia  bearing  on  one  side  of  the  third  layer  of  the
basal receptacle, composed of the stalk cell and the perith-
ecium proper; stalk cell narrower below and broader above,
longer  than  broad,  9 × 6 µm;  the  perithecium  proper  elon-
gated  ovate,  39 × 14 µm,  with  distinct  projection  near  the
subapical portion.

Antheridium  bearing on one  side of  the  basal receptacle,
composed  of  the  stalk  cell  and  the  antheridium  proper;
stalk  cell  inflated,  stouter  and  smaller  than  those  of  the
perithecium and the distal receptacle (main axes), 4 × 4 µm;
antheridium  proper  elongated  flask-shaped,  the  pointed
apex bent externally, 12~18 × 3~6 µm. The ascospores 22 ×
2.5 µm.

Host species. Scaphisoma rufum Achard

Distribution. Korea (known only from the type locality).

1 (holotype), 2011-2, 2011-3.

The present species is similar to E. cybocephali in gen-
eral  appearance,  but  it  is  distinguished  from  the  latter  by
the  distal  portion  of  its  receptacle  which  is  composed  of
seven  layers  and  the  terminal  phialides  [1-9].  This  new
species is unique in having a single terminal phialide shaped
an  elongated  cylindrical  form  on  the  distal  portion  of  the
main axis (receptacle) (Fig. 1).

This  species  was  a  parasite  on  Scaphisoma  rufum
Achard  (Scaphidiidae,  Coleoptera).  Thalli  occurred  on
pronotum,  elytra,  abdomen  and  sternites  of  host  insects.
The  specific  epithet  was  chosen  after  Dr.  Chaekyu  Lim,
Prisident  of  Koguryeo  College,  who  collected  this  fungus
together with the authors.
