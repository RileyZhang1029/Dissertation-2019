The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem and a public health issue.
In recent decades, various genetic mechanisms involved in the spread of resistance genes
among bacteria have been identiﬁed. Integrons – genetic elements that acquire, exchange,
and express genes embedded within gene cassettes (GC) – are one of these mechanisms.
Integrons are widely distributed, especially in Gram-negative bacteria; they are carried
by mobile genetic elements, plasmids, and transposons, which promote their spread
within bacterial communities. Initially studied mainly in the clinical setting for their involve-
ment in antibiotic resistance, their role in the environment is now an increasing focus of
attention. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of recent studies of
antibiotic-resistance integrons in the environment, highlighting their potential involvement
in antibiotic-resistance outside the clinical context. We will focus particularly on the impact
of human activities (agriculture, industries, wastewater treatment, etc.).

Bacterial evolution has largely been shaped by the high plasticity
of bacterial genomes, leading to their adaptation to most ecosys-
tems. This ability to exchange and rearrange genomic sequences to
gain new traits has been extensively demonstrated with the bacter-
ial resistance to antibiotics. Today, the increasing rate of antibiotic
resistant bacteria is a major public health issue (Davies and Davies,
2010). During the last decade, several studies have underlined
the environmental resistome as a source of resistance genes of
clinical interest (D’Costa et al., 2006; Aminov and Mackie, 2007;
Martínez, 2008; Wright, 2010). While mutation events contribute
to the bacterial adaptation, horizontal gene transfer seems to be
the main cause of the rapid proliferation of antibiotic-resistance
genes across a wide diversity of bacteria. Much of this horizon-
tal gene transfers have been shown to occur in the environment
(Aminov, 2011). Nevertheless, the diversity of mobile genetic ele-
ments currently described (Wozniak and Waldor, 2010; Bertels
and Rainey, 2011), shows that beyond horizontal gene transfer,
the loss and acquisition of functional modules are an important
part in the processes of rapid bacterial adaptation and develop-
ment of resistance. Integrons are one of the genetic elements
involved in the adaptation of bacteria. We address the question
of the involvement of integrons in the environmental spread of
antibiotic resistance. More speciﬁcally, the anthropogenic impacts,
which have been shown to be involved in the antibiotic-resistance
spread in the environment, and the role of integrons in this
process.

INTEGRONS: GENERALITIES
Integrons are bacterial genetic elements able to promote acqui-
sition and expression of genes embedded within gene cassettes
(GCs; Stokes and Hall, 1989). The deﬁnition of an integron is
based on a functional platform (also called 5
conserved segment,
(cid:2)
5
CS), composed of three key elements: the intI gene, a speciﬁc
recombination site attI, and a promoter, Pc (Hall and Collis, 1995;
Boucher et al., 2007; Figure 1). The intI gene encodes an integrase
protein IntI, which belongs to the family of tyrosine recombinases
(Nunes-Düby et al., 1998).

(cid:2)

The GCs are non-replicative mobile elements, which gener-
ally couple an open reading frame (ORF) with an attC site. GCs
are integrated or excised from the functional platform by a site-
speciﬁc recombination mechanism catalyzed by the IntI integrase.
Two types of recombination can occur (Figure 1): (i) between attI
and attC sites, resulting in the insertion of GCs at the attI site, and
(ii) between two attC sites, leading to excision of the GCs (Mazel,
2006). The GCs can be found either as a linear form, included in an
integron, or as a covalently closed circular free intermediate (Collis
and Hall, 1992). GCs are usually promoterless and require the Pc
promoter for their expression as in an operon. The consequence
of this system is that the last integrated cassette is the closest to the
Pc promoter (Collis et al., 1993; Collis and Hall, 2004), leading to
the highest level of expression in the integron.

Two major groups of integrons have been described: “chro-
mosomal integrons” (CIs), and “mobile integrons” (MIs). CIs are

have been described to be mainly associated with functional
and non-functional transposons derived from Tn402. The non-
functional type is the main common structural organization
described in clinical isolates, and led some authors to call these
class 1 MIs,“clinical integrons” (Gillings et al., 2008c). In addition,
these structures are frequently embedded in plasmids or larger
transposons, such as those of the Tn3 family (Tn21, Tn1696)
allowing their dispersion (Labbate et al., 2009). The intI1 gene
sequence is highly conserved among MIs found in clinical isolates,
while it shows variability in MIs-containing environmental isolates
(Gillings et al., 2008b). Furthermore, many class 1 MIs exhibit a
(cid:2)
3
CS). However,
some authors consider using this 3
CS to detect MIs could create
a bias in detection, since some MIs lack this sequence (Betteridge
CS is composed of a qacEΔ1 gene, a functional

deletion of the qacE gene still conferring resistance to quaternary
ammonium compounds (QACs; Paulsen et al., 1993), followed by a
sul1 gene conferring resistance to sulfonamides, and orf5 encoding
a protein of unknown function.

Class 2 MIs are the second most described group. In most class
2 MIs, the intI2 gene is interrupted by a stop codon, resulting in
a truncated and non-functional protein. This results in a stable
GCs array, mainly composed of the GC dfrA1 (involved in the
resistance to trimethoprim), sat2 (involved in the resistance to
streptothricin), aadA1 (involved in the resistance to streptomycin
and spectinomycin), and orfX (unknown function; Hansson et al.,
2002). However, some class 2 MIs with a different GCs array have
been described, probably resulting from the ability of the integrase
of class 1 MIs to catalyze recombination at the attI2 site (Biskri
and Mazel, 2003; Ahmed et al., 2005; Ramírez et al., 2005, 2010;
Gassama Sow et al., 2010). Class 2 MIs are almost always associated
with the Tn7 transposon and their derivatives, hence promoting
their dissemination. Two class 2 MIs have been described recently
with a functional integrase, one containing nine GCs encoding
unknown function and the second one harbored the dfrA14 GC
followed by a second novel GC in which a lipoprotein signal pepti-
dase gene has been predicted (Barlow and Gobius, 2006; Márquez
et al., 2008).

Only few class 3 MIs have been described. Although their role
in clinical antimicrobial resistance is less important, environmen-
tal ecosystems could harbor an important pool of these elements
(see below).

MIs DISSEMINATION AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
Antibiotic pressure has probably played an important role in
the MIs selection and dissemination in bacteria. More than 130
GCs conferring resistance to antibiotics and more than 60 GCs
of unknown functions have been described in MIs (Partridge
et al., 2009). Genes involved in resistance to almost all antibiotic
families are embedded in GCs, including beta-lactams, aminogly-
cosides, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, macrolides,
lincosamides, rifampicin, and quinolones. In addition, the qac
GCs, encoding resistance determinants to antiseptics of the QACs
family, are commonly found in MIs. Studies have suggested that
MIs were more prevalent in bacterial communities subjected to
direct or indirect antibiotic pressure in clinical, agricultural, and

recombination mechanism. The IntI1 protein catalyzes the insertion (A)
and excision (B) of the GC in the integron, with GC integration occurring at
the attI recombination site. In example (A), the circularized GC3 is
integrated in linear form inside the integron platform via a speciﬁc
recombination mechanism between the attI site and the attC3 site of the
GC3. GC excision preferentially occurs between two attC sites. In example
(B), the GC1 is excised following the recombination between the two attC1
and attC3 sites. Pc: gene cassette promoter; attI: integron recombination

located on the chromosome of hundreds of bacterial species; in sil-
ico analysis showed that 17% of sequenced bacterial genomes
exhibited such genetic arrangements (Cambray et al., 2010). CIs
are often described in bacteria from marine or terrestrial ecosys-
tems, such as Vibrio spp. and Xanthomonas spp., CIs have also been
termed“super-integrons”(SIs) as they can carry up to 200 cassettes
that mainly encode proteins with unknown functions. CIs may also
carry cassettes without functional reading frames. MIs are not self-
transposable elements but are located on mobile genetic elements
such as transposons and plasmids, which promote their dissemina-
tion among bacteria. MIs contain a limited number of GCs (less
than 10 GCs; Naas et al., 2001; GenBank DQ112222). The GCs
described to date in these MIs usually encode antibiotic-resistance
determinants. MIs are therefore sometimes also called “resistant
integrons” (RIs) or “multidrug resistance integrons” (MRIs).

In this review, we will focus on MIs.

CLASSES OF MIs
Most MIs have been described in a wide range of Gram-negative
bacteria, and only sporadically in Gram-positive bacteria (Mar-
tin et al., 1990; Nesvera et al., 1998; Nandi et al., 2004; Shi et al.,
2006; Xu et al., 2010; Barraud et al., 2011). Based on the amino-
acid sequence of the IntI protein, ﬁve classes of MIs have been
described (Cambray et al., 2010). Classes 1, 2, and 3 are the most
commonly detected. Classes 4 and 5 have only been detected once
(Hochhut et al., 2001; GenBank AJ277063).

Class 1 MIs have been extensively studied due to their broad
distribution among Gram-negative bacteria of clinical
inter-
est and are the most reported in human and animals. They

environmental settings (Skurnik et al., 2005; Daikos et al., 2007;
Barlow et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2010; Kristiansson et al., 2011).
Other factors, such as QACs or heavy metals have also been shown
to be involved in the MIs dissemination, and thus probably playing
a role in their spread before the antibiotic era (see below). More
generally, it has been shown, when studying animal fecal E. coli,
that human activity in the near vicinity increased the prevalence
of MIs in these bacteria (Skurnik et al., 2006). Concerning the
role of the antibiotic selective pressure, no published studies have
demonstrated the direct in vivo selection of resistance through the
acquisition of an integron. One study has demonstrated the in vivo
selection of resistance through a rearrangement of the GCs array
within a class 1 MI under antibiotic selective pressure (Hocquet
et al., 2011).

Recent in vitro studies have shown that antibiotics are able to
induce integrase transcription, both in CIs and MIs, via the SOS
response. The SOS response is a global regulatory network con-
trolled by the transcriptional repressor LexA and induced by stress
leading to direct or indirect DNA damage, such as damage resulting
from exposure to some widely used antibiotics (ﬂuoroquinolones,
beta-lactams, trimethoprim, aminoglycosides; Guerin et al., 2009;
Baharoglu et al., 2010; Cambray et al., 2011). The activation of
the SOS response in bacteria results in integrase overexpression,
which leads to the raise of GCs recombination events.

Clinical, veterinary, and environmental surveys have shown
that bacteria harboring MIs are often associated with multidrug-
resistant (MDR) phenotypes (Bass et al., 1999; Leverstein-van Hall
et al., 2003; Biyela et al., 2004; Nijssen et al., 2005; Laroche et al.,
2009). However, the MDR proﬁle could not be linked only to the
antibiotic-resistance GCs carried by the MIs, but also to other
resistance genes located on MIs-containing plasmids and trans-
posons. This way, MIs could be co-selected with the plasmid-
and/or transposon-associated antibiotic-resistance genes (Laroche
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). For example, co-selection of class
1 MIs on plasmids harboring a tet gene (involved in the tetra-
cycline resistance) in oxytetracycline-contaminated environments
has been reported (Li et al., 2010).

The link between MIs and antibiotic resistance is still contro-
versial since several studies present divergent conclusions (Hoyle
et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2007). Furthermore many data have
to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, biases in the study of
links between MIs and antibiotic resistance could be generated
by the selective choice of antibiotic-speciﬁc resistant strains, lead-
ing to misinterpretation. Finally, this relationship between MIs
and antibiotic resistance has mainly been studied in bacteria of
clinical or veterinary interest, such as those within the family
Enterobacteriaceae.

Otherwise, the environment contains a wide range of bacter-
ial species and cultivation methods only permit the isolation of a
small fraction (around 1%; Amann et al., 1995). Techniques based
on the study of the metagenome have thus been developed to
avoid this limitation. The combination of culturing and metage-
nomics approaches on environmental ecosystems has highlighted
the roles of MIs in antibiotic-resistance dissemination. Tables 1
and 2 present an extensive list of the studies that have quantiﬁed
the occurrence of MIs in the environment, using either cultivation
methods (Table 1) or cultivation independent methods (Table 2).

Genetic methods presented in this review quantify the abundance
of integrase genes in the total DNA from different ecosystems. In
order to normalize the quantity of gene to the total bacterial com-
munities, most authors have used quantiﬁcation of the ubiquitous
bacterial 16S rRNA encoding genes. By dividing the abundance of
integrase genes by the number of 16S rRNA genes, authors were
able to demonstrate relative abundance. This ratio corresponds to
the integrase genes proportion in the total bacterial communities.
However, some authors have multiplying the ratio by the average
number of copies of the 16S rRNA encoding genes per bacteria;
which is approximately four (Klappenbach et al., 2001), and other
authors present their results as percentages. In order to integrate
all relative abundance data from diverse studies, results have been
normalized to the same ratio for the purpose of this review and
the relative abundance corresponds to the percentage of MIs per
bacterial cell (Table 2).

MIs IN THE ENVIRONMENT
There is growing evidence that the environment plays a role in the
spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic strains. Many
questions have been raised concerning the impact of the release of
antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on the environment
or on human and animal health (Aminov, 2010). The distribu-
tion of MIs, and especially the class 1 MIs, in the environment is a
growing focus of attention, as illustrated by the recent publications
presented in Tables 1 and 2.

MIs have been described in a wide range of natural ecosys-
tems, both aquatic (e.g., lakes, rivers, estuaries) and terrestrial.
However, their distribution has been investigated mainly in
human-impacted environments such as amended soils and aquatic
ecosystems inﬂuenced by urbanization, agriculture, aquaculture,
industrial waste, and even in indoor and outdoor dust.

MI OCCURRENCE IN “NATURAL” ENVIRONMENTS
Different authors have investigated the occurrence of class 1 MIs
in ecosystems considered to be untouched or barely affected by
anthropogenic inﬂuence, these are often termed “reference sites”
and correspond in Tables 1 and 2 to the “clean area.”

Only a few teams have studied MIs abundance in soils. Gaze
et al. (2011) reported a class 1 MIs relative abundance of 0.00576%
(Table 2) by a metagenomic approach in soils with no history of
organic amendment, whereas the same authors previously found
no class 1 MIs in the bacterial culturable fraction, which was com-
posed of Bacillaceae, Paenibacillaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae
(Gaze et al., 2005). In a study on forest soils, 11 out of 24 isolated
Enterobacteriaceae strains (45%) were found to contain class 1
MIs, but these MIs harbored no GCs (Srinivasan et al., 2008).

In aquatics environments, Wright et al. (2008) and Hardwick
et al. (2008) found, using metagenomics approaches, a relative
class 1 MIs abundance recovery from 0.02 to 4%, in estuarine and
stream water/sediments/bioﬁlms, and 2.65% in creek sediments
(Table 2). Using cultivation-dependent methods, class 1 MIs were
found in lake sediments, with a prevalence of 1–4% (Stokes et al.,
2006; Gillings et al., 2008a). Some studies investigated the GCs
content of class 1 MIs. More often, one to three GCs were present,
mainly encoding unknown function. GCs implied in the resis-
tance to QACs (qac alleles) were also frequently described and

ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCE OF MIs
The class 1 MIs are ubiquitous elements naturally occurring in
the environment, and different studies suggest that these elements
emerged from ancestral environmental CIs (Rowe-Magnus et al.,
2001; Mazel, 2006). Following the discovery of several class 1 MIs
lacking resistance genes in environmental samples and located
on the bacterial chromosome (Stokes et al., 2006; Gillings et al.,
2008a), an evolutionary model was proposed and is now well docu-
mented (Gillings et al., 2008a; Labbate et al., 2009; Cambray et al.,
2010; Stokes and Gillings, 2011). This model involves a succes-
sion of evolutionary recombination events, which facilitated the
spread of class 1 MIs among pathogenic bacteria. These events led
to the association of an “ancient” chromosomal class 1 MI with
mobile functions of a Tn402-like transposon, and the acquisition
of a qacE and sul1 genes. During this evolution, deletions, inser-
tions, and other rearrangements ﬁnally shaped the 3
CS of current
class 1 MIs found in clinical isolates, as well as their inclusion in
larger mobile platforms (plasmids and transposons), resulting in

(cid:2)

the spread of these elements among a broad range of bacteria,
including pathogenic species (Gillings et al., 2008a; Labbate et al.,
2009). Finally, it has been suggested that the class 1 MIs were prob-
ably widely distributed in Proteobacteria before the antibiotic era
(Stokes and Gillings, 2011). These authors suggested that these
class 1 MIs were unlikely to have GCs encoding antibiotic resis-
tant determinants, and that they further evolved by acquisition of
the 3
CS and antibiotic-resistance GCs. Nevertheless, a class 1 MI
found in a Pseudomonas isolate recently recovered from 15,000- to
40,000-years-old Siberian permafrost with all the characteristics
of a typical clinical class 1 MI, i.e., 5
CS, an antibiotic
resistant GC (aadA2 encoding resistance determinants to strep-
tomycin and spectinomycin), localization on a mobile element
(Tn5045 transposon), contradicts this hypothesis (Petrova et al.,
2011).

ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACT ON MIs DISTRIBUTION
Rivers, seas, and lakes
Water is the main vector of pollutants in the environment and
thus has received most attention. Furthermore, water bodies
have been underlined as ideal vectors for the antibiotic-resistance

dissemination (Lupo et al., 2012). Indeed, compared to the “nat-
ural” waters previously described, the prevalence of class 1 MIs-
containing strains is higher in known polluted waters (Table 1).
The variation of results observed among studies may depend on
many factors, such as the selected bacterial species, the applied
culture method (selective or not selective), as well as the sample
characteristics (e.g., sediment or water, occurrence of rain events
before sampling, close location of a wastewater discharged site).
Using metagenomic approaches, urban and agricultural activities
were positively associated with class 1 MIs. High concentrations of
class 1 MIs were found in a Chinese river located in an urban and
agriculturally inﬂuenced region, with around 107–108 copies· L
−1
and 1011 copies· g
−1 of sediment (Luo et al., 2010), whereas in a
clean area, concentrations of class 1 MIs were found to be around
104 copies· L
−1 of sediments (Wright
et al., 2008). Zhang et al. (2009b) found a signiﬁcant enrichment
of class 1 MIs into the Yangtze river along its course through the
Nanjing city, highlighting the impact of urban areas on rivers.
Also, the relative abundance of class 1 MIs has been strongly cor-
related with the contribution of treated sewage output ﬂow in the
receiving river sediment (Rosewarne et al., 2010). This has been
conﬁrmed in a recent study carried out by Lapara et al. (2011),
underlining the role of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
in the dissemination of class 1 MIs in the environment. Otherwise,
ﬁsh farming has been shown to signiﬁcantly elevate the prevalence
of class 1 MIs in motile Aeromonads in river waters. The MIs iden-
tiﬁed contained dfr GCs encoding trimethoprim determinants,
and their occurrence correlated with the administration of com-
bined sulfonamide/trimethoprim drugs in freshwater ﬁsh farms
(Schmidt et al., 2001). In polluted estuaries, the prevalence of class
1 MIs appears to be less important than in the aquatic ecosystems
previously described, with values ranging between 2.7 and 14.7%
(Laroche et al., 2009). Nevertheless, it has been observed that in
anthropogenically impacted estuaries the relative abundance was
around 10 times more than in an unpolluted reference estuary
(Wright et al., 2008; Table 2). The authors did not show any inﬂu-
ence of the tide, the relative MIs abundance being similar during
ebb or ﬂood tides.

Studies involving efﬂuents of factories which produce antibi-
otics showed that antibiotic production could have an effect on
the prevalence of MI-containing bacteria in the receiving river
(Li et al., 2009, 2010). In these two studies, the impact differed
according to the industry production, although the efﬂuent treat-
ment processes were equivalent in the two industries (anaerobic
digestion following by activated sludge process without disinfec-
tion step). Indeed, the penicillin production efﬂuents elevated the
prevalence of class 1 MIs-harboring strains in the river, from 0%
upstream of the discharge to 9.1% after the treated efﬂuent was
discharged whereas the oxytetracycline production efﬂuents ele-
vated the MIs prevalence in the river from 3% upstream of the
discharge to 86.2% downstream (Li et al., 2009, 2010). Moreover,
the authors suggested that some Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp.
isolates harbored simultaneously up to seven different class 1 MIs
per bacteria, from the efﬂuent of the oxytetracycline factory, as well
as in the receiving river. In comparison, the bacteria from upstream
of the WWTP harbored only one class 1 MI. More recently in a
metagenomics study, authors observed a 6.7-fold enrichment of

class 1 MIs in river sediments downstream of a treated WWTP
efﬂuent discharge point from an antibiotic production complex
(Kristiansson et al., 2011).

However, the impact of anthropogenic activities is not limited
to antibiotic pressure alone, since similar observations have been
made in environments without sources of antibiotics input. An
Australian study has correlated the rise of the relative abundance
of class 1 MIs with environmental parameters (Hardwick et al.,
2008). When the environmental conditions were more stressful to
the bacteria, the relative abundance of class 1 MIs was higher.
Industrial activities (mainly resulting in heavy metal contami-
nation) also have been shown speciﬁcally to contribute to the
increase of class 1 MIs relative abundance (Wright et al., 2008;
Rosewarne et al., 2010). It has been shown that adding tetracy-
cline or cadmium to a water stream in microcosm experiments
increased the MIs relative abundance by a factor of between 10-
and 100-fold (Wright et al., 2008). The co-selection of resistance
genes with heavy metal such as mercury resistance has been previ-
ously described (Aminov and Mackie, 2007). Class 1 MIs have been
described on the Tn21 transposon which also contains a mercury
resistance operon (Liebert et al., 1999). Antiseptic agents as QACs
have also been shown to be associated with a higher prevalence
of class 1 MIs (Gillings et al., 2008c). In QACs contaminated reed
bed, it was shown that 95% of the isolated strains with class 1 MIs
harbored a qac gene (Gaze et al., 2005). Heavy metals and QACs
are thus probably involved in MIs dissemination and may have
contributed to the MIs selection before the antibiotic era (Stokes
and Gillings, 2011).

In anthropogenic-impacted waters, an important diversity of
GCs has been recovered (Rosser and Young, 1999; Roe et al.,
2003; Henriques et al., 2006; Taviani et al., 2008; Laroche et al.,
2009; Li et al., 2009; Ozgumus et al., 2009; Verner-Jeffreys et al.,
2009; Kumar et al., 2010; Rosewarne et al., 2010; Chen et al.,
2011). Resistance to almost all families of antimicrobials has been
recovered with various GCs: aad, aac (conferring resistance to
aminoglycosides); blaCARB-2, blaOXA, blaP1 (conferring resistance
to beta-lactams); dfr (conferring resistance to trimethoprim); catB
(conferring resistance to chloramphenicol); ereA (conferring resis-
tance to erythromycin); arr (conferring resistance to rifampicin);
and qac (conferring resistance to QACs). Moreover, GCs with
unknown function have been also commonly found. Several stud-
ies have characterized the total pool of integron GCs from environ-
mental samples by using a PCR approach targeting only the GCs
(attC sites) and not the integrase genes. They showed a huge GCs
diversity mostly encoding unknown functions, and underlined
the effect of both environmental and anthropogenic conditions
on the GCs pool composition (Koenig et al., 2008, 2009, 2011;
Huang et al., 2009; Elsaied et al., 2011). Anthropogenic activity
thus increases the prevalence of class 1 MIs in microbial com-
munities. These anthropogenic environmental changes result in
an increase in transferable genetic elements potentially harboring
resistance genes, and an ability to capture new resistance genes
from autochthonous hosts. Antibiotic-resistance genes located in
mobile genetic elements (plasmids, transposons, integrons) have
been suggested to be “genetic pollutants” representative of human
activities (Martinez, 2009a). Moreover, anthropogenic stresses has
been suggested to facilitate the possible transfer of chromosomal

resistance genes to the mobile gene pool accelerating the evolu-
tion and the possible spread in human-pathogenic strains (Cattoir
et al., 2008; Picão et al., 2008; Martinez, 2009a,b; Rahube and Yost,
2010).

Class 2 MIs are less prevalent than class 1 in polluted waters
(0–7.4%), Table 1. In a culture-independent method survey, the
low relative abundance rate of class 2 MIs from river has been
underlined (Luo et al., 2010). These results suggest that their role
in aquatic ecosystems is probably minor.

Sewage and wastewater treatment plants
Wastewater treatment plants are the interface between human
waste and both the aquatic and soil environments (Figure 2).
They collect efﬂuents from diverse sources (such as hospital, pri-
vate household, industries, animal husbandries), which contribute
to the ﬁnal ecosystem of the WWTP. These include the organics,
chemicals, and microbiological wastes. Finally the WWTP ecosys-
tem constitutes a “broth” where each element interacts with each
other under a physical and chemical constraint resulting mainly in
an organic degradation in the aqueous and solid phase. Microor-
ganisms are key to the process resulting in organic and chemical
degradation or transformation. The bacterial communities are
organized in free bioﬁlm entities (called bacterial ﬂocs), which
constitute the total biomass (the sludge). As suggested by many
authors, the high bacterial density, due to the nutritional richness,
indicates that WWTP are hot spots for horizontal gene trans-
fer (Tennstedt et al., 2003). Moreover, the antibiotics potentially
present in the WWTP could select antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
as shown for erythromycin (Louvet et al., 2010), thereby enabling
the persistence of antibiotic-resistance plasmids. It has been shown
that sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin at sub-inhibitory concentra-
tions in activated sludge improved the stability of the pB10 plasmid
in E. coli (Merlin et al., 2011). This co-existence of bacteria and
antibiotics in WWTP increases the frequency of genetic variations
(as recombination events) and the possible emergence of novel
mechanisms of resistance (Baquero et al., 2008).

The highest concentrations of class 1 MIs ever described have
been recovered from raw efﬂuents with values comprised between

1010 and 1012 copies· L
−1 (Table 2). Class 1 MIs have been
described at all stages of the WWTP process with variable preva-
lence or relative abundance (Tables 1 and 2), nevertheless their
relative abundance in the ﬁnal treated efﬂuents highlights the inef-
ﬁciency of the process to remove bacteria harboring these genetic
elements (this will be described below in more details). In acti-
vated sludge, 3–61% of the isolated strains harbored a class 1 MI
(Table 1). By metagenomics approach, the relative abundance of
class 1 MIs varied (Table 2). These variations could be explained
by the different methods of nucleic acids extraction as well as the
primers used to detect the MIs. Nevertheless relative abundance
up to 40% has been found suggesting that the activated sludge
is a hot spot for class 1 MIs selection and/or dissemination. In
addition, two studies showed that 12% of isolated plasmids from
WWTP sludge carried MIs (Tennstedt et al., 2003; Moura et al.,
2007), among which more than half were broad-host-range plas-
mids displaying very high transfer frequencies (Tennstedt et al.,
2003).

As previously described in the aquatic ecosystems, the low
prevalence of class 2 MIs in WWTP suggests that their role is prob-
ably minor. Although less than 10 publications have reported class
3 MIs, 2 of them have been described in Delftia sp. (D. acidovorans
and D. tsuruhatensis) isolated from activated sludge (Xu et al.,
2007). These class 3 MIs contained GCs of unknown function.
Moreover, using molecular approach, class 3 MIs were detected
in efﬂuents from an urban WWTP and a slaughter house WWTP
(Moura et al., 2010). These ﬁndings suggest that even if class 3
MIs play a minor role in clinical microbiology, their role in the
environment is probably more extensive.

The analysis of GCs content from wastewater ecosystems
showed a huge diversity of genes encoding antibiotic resistance:
resistances to aminoglycosides with aad, aacA GCs; to beta-lactams
with blaOXA, blaVIM-2, blaIMP, blaP1, blaGES-5, and blaGES-7 GCs; to
trimethoprim with dfr gene GCs; to chloramphenicol with cat and
cml GCs; to erythromycin with ereA and estX GCs; to rifampicin
with arr GCs; and to quinolones with qnrVC4 GC (Tennstedt et al.,
2003; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2007; Moura et al., 2007, 2012; Taviani
et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009, 2010; Pellegrini et al., 2009, 2011; Zhang
et al., 2009b; Xia et al., 2010; Girlich et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2011;
Ma et al., 2011a; Scotta et al., 2011). A molecular approach describ-
ing the global pool of GCs in WWTP have shown a great diversity
of GCs, mainly encoding for determinants implied in metabolic
functions or unknown functions, suggesting the wide potential
reservoir of GCs in WWTP (Moura et al., 2010).

Efﬁciency of WWTP process to remove MIs
While the WWTP reduced the bacterial load, it appears that the
treatment is inefﬁcient to remove both antibiotic resistant bac-
teria (Novo and Manaia, 2010; Luczkiewicz et al., 2010), and
MIs-harboring bacteria.

As presented in Tables 1 and 2, the prevalence or relative abun-
dance of MIs after the activated sludge process is not reduced,
and is even often higher than in the raw efﬂuent (Ferreira da Silva
et al., 2007; Moura et al., 2007; Figueira et al., 2011; Ma et al.,
2011a). These authors often concluded that activated process can
remove bacteria, but do not reduce signiﬁcantly the bacteria har-
boring class 1 MIs. When using abundance normalized to the total

Integron and environmental antibiotic resistance

DNA amount, same observation have been done (Zhang et al.,
2009a), however in another study, these authors found that the
efﬂuent treatment process decreased the MIs rate (Zhang et al.,
2009b). Nevertheless, normalization to DNA amount is critical as
total community DNA usually contains DNA of non-bacterial ori-
gin. The removal of bacteria bearing antibiotic-resistance genetics
elements by the WWTP is a new challenge for the future. Sev-
eral studies have investigated the efﬁciency of different advanced
processes such as UV treatment, membrane biological reactors,
and chlorination, to remove bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistance
genes (Auerbach et al., 2007; Garcia et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010;
Huang et al., 2011; Munir et al., 2011), but no studies have exam-
ined the effects on MIs. Recently, hospital efﬂuents were shown to
be potential sources of dissemination of MIs in the sewage net-
work (Guo et al., 2011). Oberlé et al. (2012) noted a decrease of
the prevalence of class 1 MIs in E. coli along the efﬂuents treat-
ment from the hospital to the WWTP and the receiving river
continuum. As treatment of hospital efﬂuents onsite is a grow-
ing and controversial question (Pauwels and Verstraete, 2006;
Kümmerer, 2008; Ort et al., 2010; Escher et al., 2011), these
data need conﬁrmation by further studies in order to assess the
impact of these speciﬁc efﬂuents on the release of MIs in the
WWTP.

Activated sludges are often used in agriculture as organic
amendment (Figure 2). However, before their use, treatments in
order to reduce their volume and improve stability are applied.
Several studies have speciﬁcally investigated the potential of aer-
obic and anaerobic treatments to reduce class 1 MIs in activated
sludges, demonstrating a better performance of anaerobic ther-
mophilic process (50–60˚C) to decrease the relative abundance of
class 1 MIs (Ghosh et al., 2009; Diehl and Lapara, 2010). How-
ever, dissimilar results have been obtained in same conditions
by Ma et al. (2011b), suggesting that other factors may inﬂu-
ence the MIs occurrence during the sludge digestion. Evidence
of horizontal gene transfers in WWTP sludge has been shown by
Merlin et al. (2011). They have shown that, horizontal transfer of
pB10 plasmid occurred in sludge from the anaerobic digesters or
from ﬁxed bioﬁlm reactors, with higher efﬁciency in ﬁxed bioﬁlm
conditions.

Soil ecosystem and the animal wastes as sources of MIs
While the soil “resistome” is a vast original reservoir of resis-
tance genes (D’Costa et al., 2006; Allen et al., 2010), manure has
been shown to signiﬁcantly increase the mobile genetic resistance
elements pool (Heuer et al., 2011). Recent studies have high-
lighted the role of the amendment practice on the input of MIs
in soil (Heuer and Smalla, 2007; Binh et al., 2009; Byrne-Bailey
et al., 2010; Gaze et al., 2011), see Table 2. Moreover, studies on
sewage sludge and pig slurry amendment showed that even if the
prevalence of class 1 MIs decreased after the particular amend-
ment (2 years and 10 months, respectively), the prevalence was
still higher than in control soils without amendment (around 100
times more; Byrne-Bailey et al., 2010; Gaze et al., 2011). Some
authors studied the GCs array of class 1 MIs introduced in soil via
manure amendment and mainly found streptomycin and spectin-
omycin resistance aadA GCs (Heuer and Smalla, 2007; Binh et al.,
2009). Class 2 MIs have been also identiﬁed from amended soils

with relative high rates (Byrne-Bailey et al., 2009, 2010; Rodríguez-
Minguela et al., 2009). The high antibiotics consumption in some
animal husbandries, and their systemic application as food addi-
tives in the past, had probably signiﬁcantly contributed to MIs
dissemination in amended soils. Tschäpe (1994) showed that the
streptothricin usage as food additive contributed to the dissemi-
nation of sat genes in amended soils via mobile genetic structures,
such as the Tn7 transposon carrying a class 2 MI usually bearing
a streptothricin-resistant sat2 GC.

Animal wastes (e.g., manure, poultry litter, and slurry) are the
main vectors of MIs dissemination in soil. As recently reviewed
by Heuer et al. (2011), only a few studies have investigated the
reduction of some resistance genes following different processes,
such as storage, composting, and anaerobic digestion (Chen et al.,
2007, 2010; Heuer et al., 2008). Only composting was efﬁcient
in reducing the prevalence and absolute amount of erythromycin
resistance genes (Chen et al., 2007). Concerning the MIs, one study
reported that after 57 days of storage of manure at 20˚C, the class 1
MIs GCs array electrophoresis gel proﬁles were almost identical to
that at the beginning of the experiment; however the GCs contents
was not investigated (Heuer et al., 2008).

ROLE OF THE FOOD CHAIN
The food chain probably also takes place in the transit of MIs
from the environments to the human. Indeed, bacteria harbor-
ing MIs have been recovered from a variety of aquatic living
organisms, such as in prawns, with an Enterobacter cloacae har-
boring a class 1 MI (Gillings et al., 2009b); or in Corbicula
with a class 1 MIs relative abundance of 4% (Wright et al.,
2008); and in oysters where the uncommon class 3 MIs prevailed
(Barkovskii et al., 2010). Transfers of MIs between animals and
human occur and have been well reviewed by Stokes and Gillings
(2011). Class 1 MIs have been also reported from bioﬁlms of
drinking water supplies (Tables 1 and 2; Gillings et al., 2008a;
Zhang et al., 2009a). All these results underline the link, via the
food chain, between the environmental MIs and the human or
animal MIs.

CONCLUSION
As described in this review, MIs are efﬁcient tools for bacterial
adaptation and play a signiﬁcant role in antibiotic resistance. Envi-
ronmental studies demonstrated that anthropogenic impact lead
to enrichment of class 1 MIs. More speciﬁcally, all factors leading to
bacterial stress, such as antibiotics, QACs, or high concentrations
of heavy metals resulted in the selection of class 1 MIs-harboring
bacteria. Several hot spots of class 1 MIs dissemination have been
identiﬁed, as agricultural manure amendment, WWTP, or indus-
trial efﬂuents. While these wastes are treated in varying degrees
before their discharge, it appears that the current processes are
inefﬁcient to reduce MIs dissemination. This uncontrolled dis-
semination of MIs in the environment could represent a risk for
human health.
