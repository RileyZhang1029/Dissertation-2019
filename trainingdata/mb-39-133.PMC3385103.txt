Mycelial  growth  and  survival  ratio  of  ectomycorrhizal  fungi  were  determined  after  storage  at  −70oC  for  1,  3,  or  6  mon.
Seventeen  of  23  ectomycorrhizal  fungi  did  not  survive  after  storage  for  more  than  6  mon,  whereas  Cenococcum  geophilum,
Lepista  nuda,  and  some  species  of  Rhizopogon  and  Suillus  did  survive.

Ectomycorrhizal  (EcM)  fungi  are  important  symbionts
that  associate  with  roots  of  woody  plants,  such  as  Betu-
laceae,  Fagaceae,  Salicaceae,  and  Pinaceae,  in  boreal  and
temperate  regions  [1].  In  total,  20,000~25,000  fungal  spe-
cies  that  belong  to  Basidiomycota,  Ascomycota,  and
Zygomycota are estimated to be involved in EcM associa-
tions  [2].  EcM  associations  play  significant  roles  in  plant
establishment  by  promoting  nutrient  and  water  uptake  of
host plants and enhancing tolerance towards stressful situ-
ations encountered by hosts [1]. Consequently, EcM fungi
are an effective biological resource and are used for refor-
estation in degraded areas [3].

A  pure,  viable,  and  genetically  stable  inoculum  source
is  essential  for  practical  use  of  EcM  fungi.  However,  fre-
quent  subculturing  is  necessary  when  stock  cultures  are
stored  at  room  temperatures.  Other  than  the  time  and
labor  involved  in  making  transfers,  care  must  be  exer-
cised  to  prevent  mutations.  Various  preservation  methods
have  been  developed  to  reliably  store  stock  cultures  for
fungal  collections  [4].  Freeze-drying  is  definitely  the  best
way,  because  stock  cultures  stored  in  ampoules  can  be
stored  without  any  special  requirements.  The  products  are
light,  inactive,  and  dry  and  have  excellent  longevity.  This
method  can  be  applied  successfully  to  conidia,  spores,  or
sporulating  fungi  [5-9];  however,  filamentous  non-sporu-
lating  fungi  are  highly  sensitive  to  freeze-drying  [4, 10],
except  for  some  successes  reported  for  Claviceps  [11],
some  EcM  fungi  [12],  and  some  edible  mushrooms  [13].
EcM fungi are highly sensitive to freeze drying due to their
non-sporulating  nature  under  in  vitro  conditions.  Indeed,
our preliminarily studies revealed that 34 EcM fungal iso-
lates  of  Amanita,  Cenococcum,  Laccaria,  Lactarius,  Lepista,

Paxillus,  Pisolithus,  Rhizopogon,  Russula,  Scleroderma,
Suillus,  and  Tomentella  did  not  survive  after  freeze-dry-
ing  procedure.  Deep  freezing  methods  produce  high  sur-
vival  rates  for  some  fungal  isolates  [10, 14-18]  and  are
applicable  rather  than  freeze  drying  [4, 5].  Methods  using
nitrogen,  that  is,  storing  at  ultra-low  temperature  (−196oC),
yield  good  results  [10, 16]  but  are  rather  expensive  and
troublesome  because  they  require  a  regular  supply  of  liq-
uid nitrogen. Methods using electric deep freezers (−70 to
−85oC) are relatively cheap, labor-saving, and reliable alter-
natives  [17, 18].  However,  whether  EcM  fungal  isolates
can  be  maintained  for  extended  periods  under  deep  freez-
ing has not been well studied.

To  understand  how  long  EcM  fungal  isolates  can  be
stored in a deep freezer (−70oC) and to understand whether
growth  characteristics  change  or  not  after  freeze  storage,
EcM  fungal  isolates  were  stored  in  a  deep  freezer  at
−70oC  for  1,  3,  or  6  mon  and  their  mycelial  growth  and
survival ratios were determined.

Twenty-three  EcM  fungal  isolates,  including  22  spe-
cies of Basidiomycota and 1 species of Ascomycota, were
collected  from  several  coastal  pine  forests  and  artificial
forests  in  inland  areas  of  Korea  in  2008  and  2009  (Table
1).  Each  fungal  isolate  was  identified  by  observation  of
the  isolates  sources,  i.e.,  sporocarps,  except  for  Amanita
ibotengutake,  Cenococcum  geophilum,  Lepista  nuda,  and
species of Rhizopogon, Suillus and  Tomentella, which were
identified  based  on  sequencing  of  internal  transcribed  spacer
regions,  including  the  5.8S  rDNA  region.  DNA  extraction,
PCR,  and  sequencing  were  performed  as  described  previ-
ously  [19].  All  isolates  were  deposited  in  the  Laboratory
of  Tree  Pathology  and  Mycology  (TPML)  at  Kangwon

National  University,  Korea.  The  stock  cultures  for  deep
freezing were stored on modified Melin-Norkrans (MMN)
agar  medium  [20]  under  dark  conditions  at  25oC.  Precul-
tured  fungal  colonies  of  each  isolate,  which  were  incu-
bated  for  30~45  days  on  agar  plate  medium,  were  bored
around  their  peripheries  with  a  5 mm  cork  borer  to  make
agar  discs  with  fungal  mycelia.  Skimmed  milk  was  used
as  a  cryoprotectant,  because  it  produced  a  higher  survival
ratio  than  that  of  dimethyl  sulfoxide  or  glycerin  after  7
days  of  storage  in  a  deep  freezer  in  a  preliminary  study.
Each  mycelial  disk  was  transferred  to  a  1.5 mL  cryotube
containing  1.0 mL  of  10%  sterilized  skimmed  milk.  The
cryotubes  were  sealed  with  caps  and  incubated  for  1 hr  at
4oC,  stored  in  a  freezer  for  3 hr  at  −20oC,  and  then  trans-
ferred  immediately  to  −70oC.  A  preliminary  study  revealed
that  the  cooling  rate  from  4  to  −20oC  was  approximately
1oC/min, which is preferable for successful pre-freezing of
fungi  [4, 12].  Cryotubes  were  withdrawn  from  the  −70oC
freezer  at  1,  3,  and  6  mon  after  storage  and  immediately
soaked  in  a  water  bath  (37oC)  until  completely  thawed.
Five  replicates  were  used  for  each  treatment.  Mycelial
disks  were  then  transferred  onto  fresh  MMN  agar  plates,
and  their  radial  growth  and  survival  rates  were  deter-
mined  after  1  mon  incubation.  Mycelial  disks  that  were
not  subjected  to  freezer  storage  were  directly  transferred
onto MMN agar media as controls.

Comparisons  of  mycelial  weight  for  the  different  dura-
tions  of  freezer  storage  were  made  using  the  nonparamet-
ric  Kruskal-Wallis  test.  Data  were  analyzed  by  the  Steel-
Dwass  test  to  determine  the  differences  among  treatments

(p<0.05). The statistical tests were performed using R ver.
2.10.0 [21].

After  the  1-mon  freezer  storage,  only  three  isolates  (A.
ibotengutake,  Russula  sp.  2  and  Scleroderma  sp.)  showed
complete  inhibition  of  mycelial  growth,  and  two  isolates
(Amanita  sp.  1  and  Suillus  pictus)  had  a  low  survival
ratio;  only  one  of  five  replicates  were  viable.  These  iso-
lates  also  showed  complete  inhibition  in  mycelial  growth
or  a  low  survival  ratio  after  freezer  storage  for  3  mon.
Eighteen  isolates  showed  a  high  survival  ratio;  more  than
four of five replicates were viable after 1 and/or 3 mon of
freezer  storage.  However,  the  survival  ratio  of  fungal  iso-
lates  that  survived  after  3  mon  of  storage  decreased  dra-
matically  when  the  storage  duration  reached  6  mon.  Nine
isolates  (Laccaria  amethystina,  two  species  of  Lactarius,
Paxillus  involutus,  Pisolithus  tinctorius,  Russula  sp.  1,
Suillus luteus, and two species of Tomentella), with a high
survival  ratio  after  3  mon  of  storage,  showed  complete
inhibition  in  mycelial  growth,  and  two  isolates  (Rhizopogon
sp. 1 and 4) showed a low survival ratio; two of five rep-
licates  were  viable.  Six  isolates  (C.  geophilum,  L.  nuda,
Rhizopogon  sp.  2  and  3,  Suillus  granulatus,  and  Suillus
placidus) had a high survival ratio; more than four of five
replicates were viable after 6 mon of storage.

Among  12  isolates  with  a  low  survival  ratio  or  com-
plete inhibition in mycelial growth when the storage dura-
tion reached 6 mon, six isolates (P. involutus, P. tinctorius,
Rhizopogon  sp.  1  and  4,  Russula  sp.  1,  and  S.  luteus)
showed  significantly  lower  mycelial  growth  after  freezer
storage  for  1  and  3  mon  compared  to  that  of  the  control

treatment.  Three  isolates  (L.  amethystina,  Lactarius  sp.  1,
and  Tomentella  sp.  1)  had  significantly  lower  mycelial
growth  after  3  mon  of  storage.  The  remaining  three  iso-
lates  showed  variable  growth  after  1  mon  of  storage  and
were  not  significantly  different  from  the  control  treatment
after 3 mon of storage. Among the six isolates that showed
a  high  survival  ratio  after  6  mon  of  storage,  Rhizopogon
sp. 2 had significantly lower mycelial growth after  1 mon
and  6  mon  of  storage.  Five  isolates  (C.  geophilum,  L.
nuda, Rhizopogon sp. 2 and 3, S. granulatus, and S. placi-
dus) were not significantly different from the control treat-
ment after 3 and 6 mon storage. Three of five isolates had
significantly  higher  mycelial  growth  after  1  mon  storage
when compared to that of the control treatment.

Our  results  indicated  that  most  of  the  EcM  fungal  iso-
lates,  representing  17  out  of  23  fungal  species,  did  not
survive  well  after  deep  freezer  storage  at  −70oC  for  more
than  6  mon,  even  though  deep  freezer  storage  might  be
practical  for  C.  geophilum,  L.  nuda,  and  some  species  of
Rhizopogon and Suillus (Table 2). Our results are more or
less  contradictory  to  previous  studies.  Kramer  and  Mix
[15]  demonstrated  that  55  of  451  isolates  were  unable  to
survive  freezer  storage  for  1  yr.  Carmichael  [14]  showed
that  only  17  of  400  isolates  were  unable  to  survive  by

freezer  storage  for  9  mon.  Kitamoto  et  al.  [18]  demon-
strated that all isolates, including some EcM fungi such as
Entoloma,  Hebeloma,  Lepista,  and  Paxillus,  survived  for
at  least  1  yr.  Ito  and  Nakagiri  [17]  reported  that  88%  of
Agaricales  isolates  were  able  to  survive  for  1  yr.  Further
improvements  in  freezer  storage  such  as  cryoprotectant
selection  and  pre-freezing  conditions  are  needed  to  suc-
cessfully store EcM fungi by deep freezer storage.
