Taxonomic  study  of  the  crustose  lichen  Porpidia  was  performed  in  this  paper.  Three  species  are  described,  including  two
recorded  species  and  one  new  record:  Porpidia  macrocarpa  (DC.)  Hertel  &  A.  J.  Schwab.  A  description  of  each  species  is
presented  along  with  morphological,  anatomic,  and  chemical  characteristics.  A  key  to  the  identification  of  species  of  Porpidia
is  also  presented.

The  crustose  lichen  genus  Porpidia  Körber  is  a  saxi-
colous  lichen  that  is  widely  distributed  in  the  mountains
of  South  Korea.  The  genus  was  firstly  described  by  Kör-
ber  [1],  and  it  belonged  to  the  classical  family  Lecide-
aceae  and  classical  genus  Lecidea  [2]  for  a  long  time.  It
was  later  segregated  from  Lecidea  in  1975  as  the  genus
name  Huilia  Zahlbr.  by  Hertel  [3],  and  in  1984,  the  same
author [4] resurrected the genus name Porpidia as the cor-
rect name for the genus Huilia.

The species of Porpidia occur mostly on siliceous rocks,
although  a  few  are  confirmed  on  bark,  lignum,  worked
timber,  and  consolidated  soil  [5].  Due  to  their  growth  on
rock,  Porpidia  spp.  are  difficult  to  collect,  such  that  the
number  of  specimens  is  relatively  fewer  than  that  of
macro-lichens.  These  share  some  common  characteristics:
thallus endolithic to  epilithic,  0.1  to  1.5 mm  thick;  contin-
uous  thalli  almost  completely  uncracked;  thallus  gray  to
ashy  gray  or  orange;  apothecia  usually  sessile  on  thallus,
disk  pruinose  or  not,  spores  ellipsoid  and  covered  with  a
hyaline  halo,  ascus  tip  with  a  dark  blue  tubular  structure
when stained in iodine solution.

Two  species,  P.  albocaerulescens  and  P.  crustulata,  have
been  reported  in  South  Korea  [6].  Except  for  a  checklist,
no  taxonomic  study  on  this  genus  has  been  carried  out,
and  therefore  this  work  focused  on  the  detailed  taxo-
nomic analysis of this genus from South Korea. One hun-
dred  and  twenty  specimens  were  collected  from  the  main
mountains of South Korea during 2003 to 2010. Two spe-
cies,  P.  albocaerulescens  and  P.  crustulata,  were  found
during  our  study,  together  with  another  reported  species.
In total, three species are included in this paper with a key
for the identification of species of Porpidia.

Specimens  were  examined  using  standard  microscopical
techniques  and  hand-sectioned  under  a  Nikon  SMZ645

dissecting  microscope  (Nikon,  Tokyo,  Japan).  All  measure-
ments  were  made  on  material  mounted  in  water,  amyloid
reactions  were  tested  with  iodine  solution,  and  lactophe-
nol  cotton  blue  was  used  as  a  stain.  Nikon  Coolpix  4500
was used for taking photographs of the species. Thin layer
chromatography  was  performed  in  solvent  system  C
(toluene : acetic  acid = 85 : 15)  as  described  by  Elix  et  al.
[7] and White and James [8]. The specimens were lodged
at the herbarium of the Lichen & Allied Bioresource Cen-
ter,  Korean  Lichen  Research  Institute  (KoLRI),  Sunchon
National University, Korea.

The Species

Porpidia albocaerulescens (Wulfen) Hertel & Knoph
Diagnostic  characters. Thallus  grayish  green  to  whit-
ish,  sometimes  dark  to  olive  green  when  wet,  continuous,
slightly  cracked  when  dry,  0.3~1.2 mm  thick,  surface  even,
marginal  part  usually  thinner  than  the  thallus  center.  Pro-
thallus  black,  rather  obvious  when  two  individual  thallus
abut each other. Apothecia abundant, clustered and sessile,
but  sunken  in  thallus  when  young,  0.5~1.5 mm  in  diame-
ter  when  mature,  disk  black,  covered  with  white  pruina.
Hymenium  70~110 µm  high,  epithecium  brown  to  dark
brown, subhymenium 20~40 µm high, exciple dark brown

to  blackish  in  marginal  part,  lighter  brown  within.  Spores
ellipsoid, 17~25 × 6~10 µm.

Chemistry. Stictic  acid  (main),  cryptostictic  acid,  con-
stictic acid, and norstictic acid.

Habitat. On HCl-rocks, particularly in shady and humid
areas.

South Korean distribution. Rather common, widely dis-
tributed  all  over  South  Korea,  found  in  altitudes  from  sea
level up to 1,600 m.

World distribution. Eastern to Southeastern Asia, Europe,
and North America [5, 9, 10].

Remarks. The  species  was  easy  to  recognize  even  in
the field. It is the only pruinose Porpidia species in South
Korea.  By  having  a  thick  and  smooth  thallus,  as  well  as
large apothecia and thick whitish pruina, it  is easy to sep-
arate from other crustose lichen species in South Korea.

Porpidia crustulata (Ach.) Hertel & Knoph
Remarks. This  species  was  not  found  during  our  study,
but  it  has  been  reported  by  Moon  [11]  on  Mt.  Sorak.
Unfortunately,  we  did  not  find  the  species  after  several
field surveys on Mt. Sorak.

The species is characterized by having thin thallus (less
than  0.5 mm),  short  hymenium  (60~90 µm  high),  small
spores  (10~17 µm  long),  small  and  numerous  apothecia
(less  than  1 mm  in  diameter),  and  non-pruinose  black  disk.
It  is  similar  with  P.  macrocarpa  but  differs  in  having
smaller spore size, hymenium height, and apothecia size.

endolithic,  smooth  or  rugulose  in  some  old  parts,  rather
thin,  0.1  to  0.5 mm  in  diameter.  Clear  black  prothallus
present in the marginal part. Apothecia abundant and clus-
tered,  sessile  in  mature  thallus,  sunken  when  young,  0.5~
2.0  (~3.0)  mm  in  diameter,  black  or  dark  brown,  disk
non-pruinose,  usually  flat.  Hymenium  70~100 µm  high,
epithecium  usually  olive  brown,  subhymenium  20~40 µm
high,  exciple  composed  of  elongated  cells  radiating  from
hypothecium,  dark  brown  to  blackish  in  margin  and  paler
within. Spores ellipsoid, 18~23 × 6~9 µm.

Chemistry. Stictic  acid  and  cryptostictic  acid  (all  acces-
sory); or no compound.

South  Korean  distribution. Rare,  reported  only  on  Mt.
Sorak [11].

Habitat. HCl-rock, on exposed but humid area.

World  distribution.

It  has  been  reported  all  over  the

Porpidia  macrocapa  (DC.)  Hertel  &  A.  J.  Schwab  (Fig.
1A~1C)
Diagnostic  characters. Thallus  greenish  gray  to  whitish
gray,  sometimes  partly  orange,  epilithic  or  less  frequently

South  Korean  distribution. Rare,  it  is  found  only  in
Gangwon province at an altitude around 800~1,200 m.

World  distribution. Asia,  Europe,  and  North  America
[9, 10, 12].

Remarks. The species might be confused with P. crutu-
lata  when  its  apothecia  are  small,  but  it  has  a  higher

hymenium and larger spores (usually around 20 µm long),
whereas  P.  crustulata  has  spores  always  shorter  than
17 µm.  Some  P.  albocaerulescens  specimens  with  unclear
pruina on disk might be confusing, but P. macrocarpa has
much thinner thallus, smaller spores, and darker exciple.
