The existence of life in the deep terrestrial subsurface is established, yet few studies have
investigated the origin of nitrogen that supports deep life. Previously, 16S rRNA gene sur-
veys cataloged a diverse microbial community in subsurface ﬂuids draining from boreholes
3000 feet deep at Henderson Mine, CO, USA (Sahl et al., 2008). The prior characterization

INTRODUCTION
At depths of at least 3.2 km, an abundant and diverse microbial
biosphere in habits terrestrial hard rock settings (Pedersen, 1997;
Moser et al., 2003; Kovacik et al., 2006; Sahl et al., 2008), but the
rock type is likely to exert tremendous control over the geochemi-
cally available nutrients and energy sources. In the basaltic-hosted
subsurface settings, organisms may be sustained by H2 generated
from reactions between water and Fe-rich maﬁc minerals (Stevens
and Mckinley, 1995; Lin et al., 2006b). Organisms living in meta-
2−
morphosed Precambrian sediments likely utilize H2 and SO4
derived from the reaction of decaying radionuclides with water and
sulﬁde minerals in a process known as radiolysis (Lin et al., 2005,
2006b; Lefticariu et al., 2010). In sedimentary rock, organisms
may be energetically supported by organic carbon associated with
the deposits (Fredrickson et al., 1997; Kovacik et al., 2006). While
most studies have focused on determining the energy sources sup-
porting life in the terrestrial subsurface (see Lovley and Chapelle,
1995; Pedersen, 2000; Amend and Teske, 2005; Fredrickson and
Balkwill, 2006 for reviews), the origins of nutrients to subsur-
face microbial communities have been insufﬁciently investigated.
While ﬁeld and laboratory experiments have implicated microbes

in the release of species such as Ca, Si, P, and Fe from minerals
(Rogers et al., 1998; Edwards et al., 2003; Rogers and Bennett,
2004; Wu et al., 2008, 2009; Shelbolina et al., 2010), whether or not
geologically sourced nitrogen (i.e., as ammonium substituted into
potassic rocks) supports subsurface life is a question that has not
yet been posed.

Many forms of nitrogen can be utilized biologically both for
biosynthesis and energy metabolism. In subsurface settings, N2
may be sourced from the mantle (i.e., Crossey et al., 2009). Where
oxidized nitrogen is absent, ammonium formed in the subsurface
may be the most important form of nitrogen sustaining subsurface
communities, but the origin of subsurface ammonium support-
ing microbial communities is unknown. However, at least two
processes are possible. Although few nitrogen-bearing minerals
are known, the substitution of NH4
in silicate minerals is
a widespread process (Holloway and Dahlgren, 2002). Granites, for
instance, contain on average ∼45 ppm ammonium (Hall, 1999).
Another source of ammonium to subsurface environments is bio-
logical ﬁxation of subsurface N2. However, the reduction of N2 to
NH4
by the nitrogenase enzyme requires input of ATP at a high
energetic cost (Broda and Paschek, 1980) that may inhibit this

Nitrogen ﬁxation and nitriﬁcation in the granite-hosted subsurface

process under oligotrophic and anoxic conditions vs. photosyn-
thetically supported surface environments (Lovley and Chapelle,
1995). Despite this, ammonium has been detected in numerous
subsurface settings (Lin et al., 2006a; Onstott et al., 2006; Sahl
et al., 2008).

Where ammonium is present in the subsurface, it may play a
critical role not just as a nutrient, but as an energy source that sus-
tains nitrifying subsurface microbial organisms. Functional gene
studies have been used in characterizing nitriﬁcation in other
subsurface sites where ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and/or
ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria
(NOB; Proteobacteria or Nitrospira) are present (Hirayama et al.,
2005; Spear et al., 2007; Weidler et al., 2007). Both archaeal amoA
genes and AOA have been detected and commonly exceed the
AOB and bacterial amoA genes in a number of oligotrophic
settings, indicating that AOA may be adapted to low substrate
niches (Martens-Habbena et al., 2009). Nitrite oxidation has also
been recognized as a potentially important microbially mediated
process in the deep subsurface (Hirayama et al., 2005; Gihring et al.,
2006), speciﬁcally by the Nitrospira genus of bacteria. Nitrospira
appear to be the most diverse and abundant NOB in nitrifying
environments, thriving in nitrite and oxygen concentrations are
too low to support proteobacterial NOB (Daims et al., 2001, 2006).
This study evaluates the origin of ammonium in ﬂuids cir-
culating through a granite-hosted molybdenum ore-body at
>3000 foot depth. The ﬂuids contain N2, N2O, NO3
, and
ammonium and an estimated 103–104 cells ml (Sahl et al., 2008),
and thermodynamically favorable nitriﬁcation reactions may be
important in supporting the biomass detected in the ﬂuids (Swan-
ner, 2011). To evaluate possible geologic sources of ammonium,
subsurface biotites, and muscovites were screened with Fourier

The DNA was also used to evaluate whether genes for ammonium-
and nitrite-oxidation were present. The current work builds on the
prior study of Sahl et al. (2008), which reported the presence of
archaea and Nitrospira in 16S rRNA clone libraries of the borehole
ﬂuids. The new mineralogical, functional gene, and phylogenetic
analyses yield insight into the source of ammonium to the subsur-
face, and how the ecology of the subsurface microbial community
may be inﬂuenced by the presence of ammonium as an energy
source in the oligotrophic granite-hosted environment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
Fluid samples were collected for geochemistry and molecular biol-
ogy from boreholes draining at the 7025-foot level (elevation above
sea level) within Henderson Mine during sampling trips in March
2006. The collection and processing of these samples has already
been reported in Sahl et al. (2008). Samples were taken both before
and after expandable packers were inserted to exclude O2 present
in the mine tunnel air from equilibrating with draining ﬂuids.
Samples of the borehole ﬂuids are named according to the level
within the mine they were collected (e.g., 7025), whether they
were collected from boreholes before or after insertion of packing
devices (“D” for drain,“P” for packer) and the assigned number of
each borehole on that level (1, 2, 3, etc.). Additional geochemical
data for borehole 7025-D3 reported here was analyzed according
to the methodology described in Sahl et al. (2008).

Mineral samples for NH4

analysis (biotites and muscovites) in
this study were collected from surface sites surrounding the mine,
and from a drill core (Table 1). The surface samples were col-
lected from outcrops of Proterozoic biotite gneiss and migmatite
(metasediments) intruded by the 1.4 Ga Silver Plume granite
within a 10-mile radius of Henderson Mine (Theobald, 1965).

Nitrogen ﬁxation and nitriﬁcation in the granite-hosted subsurface

Henderson, Seriate, and Urad granite and the Silver Plume gran-
ite were acquired from Holly Stein at Colorado State University
(Stein, 1985). Hydrothermally altered Henderson Granite was also
acquired from a drill core, and named according to the depth of
drilling in feet (Sahl et al., 2008). Samples were crushed, sieved
between 100 and 400 μm and biotites were concentrated with a
Frantz magnetic separator. Minerals were washed in distilled H2O
and dried at 50˚C prior to analysis.

+

FTIR MICROSCOPY
in biotites and muscovites was made by FTIR
Analysis for NH4
microscopy as previously described (Busigny et al., 2003, 2004;
Papineau et al., 2005; Papineau, 2006). Brieﬂy, individual grains
were analyzed using a Thermo Nicolet Continuum microscope
linked to a Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer at the University of Col-
orado on NaCl plates under CO2-purged air. The infrared beam
was collimated to a 100 μm× 100 μm window and focused nor-
mal to the c-axis of mica grains. Two hundred transmission IR
(4000–650 cm) spectra were collected per grain using an MCT/A
detector cooled by liquid nitrogen to minimize electronic noise
and absorption of water.

AMPLIFICATION OF FUNCTIONAL GENES
The DNA used in this study was originally acquired through DNA
extraction and ampliﬁcation procedures reported in Sahl et al.
(2008). The DNA was tested here for the presence of functional
genes of the nitrogen cycle by PCR ampliﬁcation, cloning, and
sequencing. To evaluate the potential for ammonium to be bio-
logically ﬁxed in the boreholes, the nifH gene that encodes for
part of the nitrogenase enzyme was ampliﬁed from DNA of the
7025-P4 borehole using a nested PCR approach with primer sets
nifA/nifRev and nifB/nifRev, respectively (Reed et al., 2010). The
nifH products were extracted and cleaned from a gel using the
EZNA gel extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc.). The products
were then cloned using a TOPO 1-shot cloning kit (Invitrogen)
and sequenced commercially with M13F by SeqWright (Houston,
TX, USA).

In addition to the N-ﬁxation genes, two marker genes for nitri-
ﬁcation were also assessed by PCR ampliﬁcation. The primers
301F/302R (Norton et al., 2002) were used to amplify the bacterial
ammonium-oxidation gene (amoA) that encodes for part of the
ammonium monooxygenase enzyme under previously described
cycling conditions (Hirayama et al., 2005). The potential presence
of archaeal amoA genes was also assessed with previously described
primers (Francis et al., 2005; Spear et al., 2007). Finally, the
presence of nitrite oxidation genes from the Nitrospira genus was
interrogated with the nxrBF916 and nxrBR1237 primers designed
to target a 321 bp fragment of the nxrB gene that encodes for the β
subunit of the nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme (Lücker et al., 2010).
This gene was previously called norB, which is also the notation
for nitric oxide reductase, and so was recently changed to nxrB to
eliminate confusion (Starkenburg et al., 2006). As the nxrB gene is
related to genes from the nar family that encodes for nitrate reduc-
tase in phylogenetically diverse organisms, it was necessary to use
primers speciﬁc to the nitrite oxidoreductase-encoding genes from
the Nitrospira genus. Only one deﬁnitive Nitrospira nxrB gene
sequence exists in the public database from the metagenome of

Ca. Nitrospira deﬂuvii (Lücker et al., 2010), and so the primers for
that organism were used here. Successfully ampliﬁed genes were
cloned and sequenced as described above for nifH. Representative
functional gene sequences from this study have been submitted to
GenBank under accession numbers JN560700–JN560714.

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL GENES
Nucleotide sequences were edited with Sequencher 4.7. Nucleotide
sequences of the functional genes nifH and nxrB were trans-
lated to protein (amino acid) sequences using the transAlign
script (Bininda-Emonds, 2005). Both nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of functional genes were aligned using ClustalW. Sim-
ilar sequences were identiﬁed from a blastn or blastx search of
the NCBI database, and reference sequences were subsequently
downloaded from this database. Phylogenetic trees were assembled
using the RAxMLBlackBox with the JTT model of substitution
(Stamatakis et al., 2008). The maximum-likelihood search was
used to ﬁnd the best-scoring tree, which was selected and edited
in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree/). Addition-
ally, 16S rRNA sequences of Nitrospira from borehole 7025-P4
reported in Sahl et al. (2008) were reanalyzed in order to resolve
the genus-level groupings of these organisms. The sequences were
aligned using the Greengenes database (Desantis et al., 2006) and
RAxMLBlackBox was used for tree construction.

RESULTS
GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE FLUIDS
The aqueous geochemistry of ﬂuids from boreholes 7025-D1/P1,
7025-D4/P4, 7150-D1, and 7150-D3 were previously reported
(Sahl et al., 2008). Geochemistry from an additional borehole,
7025-D3, are reported here to establish that NH4
increases corre-
sponding to Mn along at least three boreholes (Figure 1). Borehole
7025-D3 had a pH of 6.14 and contained 0.52 mM Mn, 4.2 mM

and the Silver Plume granite (sample names beginning with HS-
82). Muscovite grains from hydrothermally altered Henderson
granite obtained from drill core were also analyzed (samples 1225
and 1900 m). Although reference biotites from the Moine metased-
iment (MS-14; Boyd and Philippot, 1998) were successfully ana-
lyzed as NH4

titative peak for NH4

samples displayed a peak corresponding to NH4

Genomic DNA samples from boreholes for which 16S rRNA clone
libraries had been assembled (7025-D1/P1 and 7025-P4; Sahl et al.,

nitrogen cycle. The nifH gene was successfully ampliﬁed only from

protocol. In contrast, 43 archaeal ammonium-oxidation amoA
gene sequences of ∼700 bp were ampliﬁed from 7025-P4 DNA.
Four unique phylotypes (>90% nucleotide identity) were recov-
ered. The relationship of 7025-P4 amoA and other environmental
and pure culture amoA are shown in Figure 3, where all of the
sequences included in the analysis are longer than 500 bp. One
phylotype groups together with sequences from a mine adit in Col-
orado and hot springs clones in China (Spear et al., 2007; Zhang
et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010), while two other phylotypes fall into a
previously described cluster of amoA (Beman and Francis, 2006),
determined by a common node with high bootstrap values.

The nxrB primers ampliﬁed several differently sized products,
and as such are non-speciﬁc and should not be used in future
ampliﬁcation of nxrB from environmental DNA. For this reason,
and because none of the proteobaterial nitrifying organisms (i.e.,
Nitrobacter, Nitrococcus, and Nitrospina) were detected in 7025-
P1 DNA (Sahl et al., 2008), the nxrB primers were only used on
7025-P4 DNA. Ampliﬁcation of the nxrB gene with Nitrospira-
speciﬁc primers was successful for the Nitrospira-containing DNA
from borehole 7025-P4, retrieving two sequences of ∼339 bp that
are 93% identical in amino acid to the nxrB of Ca. Nitrospira
deﬂuvii (FP929003; Lücker et al., 2010). The 7025-P4 nxrB amino
acid sequences were aligned with the nxrB from nitrite-oxidizing
Proteobacteria, as well as with sequences of the related nar genes
(encoding the nitrate reductase enzyme). All of the sequences
included in the analysis were longer than 250 bp. The 7025-P4
nxrB cluster closely with the Ca. Nitrospira deﬂuvii nxrB, a rela-
tionship that is supported by high bootstrap values (Figure 4).
This cluster is separated from the nar sequences and the nxrB
sequences of Proteobacteria.

DISCUSSION
GEOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SUBSURFACE NITROGEN CYCLE
The aqueous geochemistry of two of the borehole ﬂuids at the 7025
level addressed in this study have been previously reported (Sahl
et al., 2008). The ammonium concentrations of boreholes P1 and
P4 were 5 and 112 μM, respectively 2 weeks after being ﬁtted with
packing devices, and the concentrations are very similar to those
reported before packer insertion (9 and 113 μM, respectively).
Sahl et al. (2008) noted geochemical trends from this dataset sig-
nifying the mixing of different ﬂuids, a rock-reacted brine, and
meteoric water, via the covariance in F or SO4
and the dissolved
Mn concentration across ﬂuids sampled from ﬁve boreholes at two
levels within Henderson Mine. In this study we note that the ﬂuid
NH4
concentration also appears to increase corresponding with
the greater degree of water-rock interaction across boreholes of the
7025 level, when data from a third borehole, 7025-D3 (reported
here) is included (Figure 1). This trend suggests that NH4
is
sourced from the breakdown of NH4
-bearing minerals at depth.
From the mineral assemblage present at Henderson (Theobald,
1965; Stein, 1985), the phases most likely to contain NH4
are

biotite and muscovite, where NH4
can be substituted for K
(Honma and Itihara, 1981; Hall, 1987).

borehole 7025-P4 DNA. Cloning and sequencing of this product
resulted in retrieval of 39 nifH sequences of ∼370 bp. The two
unique nifH phylotypes (deﬁned by >90% amino acid identity)
are shown in the phylogenetic tree in Figure 2, along with nifH
from other environments, all of which are longer than 300 bp. One
phylotype (n = 2) groups with Verrucomicrobia nifH sequences
that encode the C-type nitrogenases characteristic of Clostridium,
Gram positive bacteria, and δ-Proteobacteria (Mehta et al., 2003;
Young, 2005). However, there were no Verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA
gene sequences detected in this sample. The Gram positive group
includes the Paenibacillus that are known to ﬁx nitrogen (Can-
ﬁeld et al., 2005), and Paenibacillus were isolated previously from
Henderson Mine (Mayhew et al., 2008). No nifH sequences were
ampliﬁed from the DNA of the Paenibacillus isolates with the nifH
primers used in this study (data not shown), suggesting nifH may
not be present in Henderson Mine Paenibacillus. The second phy-
lotype (n = 37) clusters separately, near to nifH sequences from
the Nitrospira phylum and encodes B-type nitrogenases (charac-
teristic of Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes; Young,
2005). The only members of the Nitrospirae phylum detected in
7025-P4 DNA sample were from the genus Nitrospira, and none of
these organisms are known to contain nifH (Lücker et al., 2010).
The amoA gene for bacterial ammonia oxidation could not
be ampliﬁed from either of the borehole samples. DNA from a
Japanese Gold Mine that contained AOB (Hirayama et al., 2005)
was used as a positive control to ensure that this was indeed a
negative result and not due to a problem with the ampliﬁcation

from the metasediments when they were emplaced (i.e., Hall et al.,
1991). However, the Tertiary Henderson granite and ore-bearing
stocks (e.g., variably containing molybdenite, quartz, K-feldspar,
biotite, ﬂuorite, pyrite, or magnetite) are not directly hosted by the
metasediments, but rather by the Precambrian Silver Plume gran-
ite. For this reason, biotites from the Silver Plume granite were also
screened for the presence of ammonium. The Silver Plume granite
biotites also do not show evidence of NH4
incorporation. Even if
Silver Plume granite did contain ammonium, it is unlikely to have
been transferred to the Henderson granite and ore-bearing stocks,
because previous isotopic studies indicate little chemical interac-
tion between the Henderson ore-body and surrounding wall rocks
(Stein and Hannah, 1985).

+

+

Another possible mechanism that could supply ammonium to
biotites of the Tertiary Henderson granite and the ore-bearing
stocks would be from interaction with the Proterozoic basement,
if it contains NH4
(Honma and Itihara, 1981; Hall, 1988). This
type of transfer is possible based on the εNd and εSr values of Hen-
derson granite, which sources its Mo from the mid- to lower crust
(Farmer and Depaolo, 1984). Although an appropriate mid- or
lower-crust sample was not available for FTIR analysis to screen
for NH4
-content, none of the biotites of the Henderson granite
and stocks contained NH4
. While other potassic phases were not
analyzed (i.e., muscovite and potassium feldspar), biotites gener-

ally have the highest NH4
contents of silicate minerals (Honma
and Itihara, 1981; Hall, 1987). However, muscovites that formed

after hydrothermal alteration of the Henderson granite were ana-
lyzed for NH4
because hydrothermal alteration of granites with
ﬂuids that have interacted with NH4
-bearing crustal rocks has
been observed for intrusive granites in Italy (Hall et al., 1991).
The hydrothermal muscovites did not contain NH4
, which is
consistent with the geological interpretation that the suite of
hydrothermally altered minerals at Henderson formed due to the
introduction of juvenile, magmatic ﬂuids that that did not inter-
act with the surrounding metasediments, granite, or groundwater
(Seedorff and Einaudi, 2004).

There are other potential sources of non-biological NH4

that
could not be evaluated for several reasons. For example, nitro-
gen compounds could have been introduced to subsurface ﬂuids
through ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) that was used as a
blasting agent at Henderson (Jensen et al., 1983). However, the
boreholes had ﬂushed for almost a year prior to sampling and only
the rock-reacted ﬂuids being dewatered from the mine contained
(i.e., borehole 7025-P4; 112 μM). A meteoric source
high NH4
was unlikely as well, as the most dilute, meteoric-dominated waters
−
contained the lowest levels of N (as NH4
;
Figure 1). Modern precipitation in Colorado can exhibit high lev-
els of nitrate (up to ∼20 μM) in the mountains from industrial
activities (Faure and Mensing, 2005) that could be transported
to the subsurface in meteoric water. However, the dilute borehole
waters at Henderson have an average residence time of 13,000 years
based on 14C dating, and is dominantly pre-1950s based on tritium
content (Sahl et al., 2008), further underscoring that this modern
meteoric water is not likely to be the nitrogen source to subsurface
ﬂuids.

BIOLOGICAL FIXATION AS A SOURCE OF SUBSURFACE AMMONIUM
The presence of nifH genes in DNA in borehole 7025-P4 (Figure 2;
112 μM NH4
), and the lack of detectable nifH genes in boreholes
7025-D1/P1 (5–9 μM NH4
) suggests that microbes inhabiting
7025-P4 ﬂuids are capable of ﬁxing N2 gas to NH4
. This ﬁnding
of a biological source of nitrogen speciﬁc to 7025-P4 is consistent
with the lack of evidence for a general subsurface nitrogen source
-bearing potassic minerals (Table 1).
from the breakdown of NH4
However, the presence of functional genes does not necessarily sig-
nify expression or activity of the encoded enzymes, and so further
experiments are needed to evaluate whether nitrogen ﬁxation is
occurring. Fresh samples would be needed to measure 15N uptake
or acetylene reduction as evidence for nitrogen ﬁxation, and we
have been unable to access Henderson Mine for further sampling
of these boreholes, and so the further geochemical assays could
not be undertaken to augment the dataset in the current study.

+

If organisms in 7025-P4 ﬂuids do ﬁx nitrogen, they would need
to be utilizing a metabolic reaction capable of generating enough
ATP and electrons to fuel nitrogen ﬁxation. Although speciﬁc N2-
ﬁxing organisms cannot be identiﬁed in 7025-P4 based solely on
the detected 16S rRNA and nifH genes, the geochemical dataset of
Sahl et al. (2008) can be used to infer which chemolithoautotrophic
metabolisms could support the subsurface community thermody-
namically. The reaction of H2S oxidation with electron acceptors
such as O2, NO3
oxidation
with NO2
, are more thermodynamically favorable in borehole
7025-P4 relative to 7025-P1(Swanner, 2011). There is a greater

−1 of electrons transferred increase between 7025-
P1 and 7025–P4 for all of these reactions, and all yield at least
−20 kJ mol
−1 of electrons transferred in borehole 7025-P4. Thus
nitrogen ﬁxation may be fueled preferentially in the more rock-
reacted borehole ﬂuid by any of these reactions. Given the fact that
the borehole ﬂuid microbial community compositions are modu-
lated by the degree of mixing between meteoric and rock-reacted
ﬂuids (Sahl et al., 2008), we suggest that the potential for nitrogen
ﬁxation is strongly tied to the aqueous geochemistry. Furthermore,
despite this energetic strain of nitrogen ﬁxation, it has been doc-
umented for deep-sea sulfate-reducing methanotroph consortia,
whose syntrophic metabolisms provides one of the lowest ener-
−1 electron
getic yields known to sustain microbial life (∼40 kJ mol
transferred to support two organisms; Dekas et al., 2009), suggest-
ing that the energetic yields of reactions possible in 7025-P4 ﬂuids
could support nitrogen ﬁxation.

+

The inference that ammonium is biologically ﬁxed in Hen-
derson ﬂuids raises another question about why nitrogen-ﬁxing
+
organisms would ﬁx nitrogen to levels as high as 112 μM NH4
in an environment where total numbers of microbes are only
103–104 cells ml, and only half of the nitrogen is converted into
organic forms (Sahl et al., 2008). Intriguingly, nitrogen ﬁxation
occurs in deep-sea methane-oxidizing archaeal/bacteria consortia
in sediments that already contain ammonium (Dekas et al.,
2009), suggesting either that localized depletions of ammonium
within the consortium drive ﬁxation, or that nitrogenase activity
is not well regulated by NH4
concentrations. A lack of reg-
+
ulation on N2-ﬁxation by NH4
concentrations up to 94 mM
has been recently documented for the verrucomicrobial methan-
otroph Methylacidiphilum fumairiolicum strain SolV (Khadem
et al., 2010), and some proteobacterial nitrogenases also appear
to be unregulated by NH4
(Rudnick et al., 1997). One other
reason for nitrogen ﬁxation in the presence of abundant ammo-
nium may be that the transfer of ammonium between nitrogen-
ﬁxing and ammonium-utilizing microbes may not be very efﬁ-
cient. Nitrogen-ﬁxing cyanobacteria from the Baltic Sea have been
observed to lose up to 30% of their ﬁxed nitrogen to bulk sur-
roundings (Ploug et al., 2010). Further culture and assay-based
studies are needed to determine if and why excess nitrogen is being
ﬁxed in 7025-P4, but such experiments were not undertaken in the
current work due to the sampling limitations discussed above.

+

It is well established that nifH tree topology often mirrors topol-
ogy of the 16S rRNA gene tree (with some variation due to lateral
gene transfer; Hennecke et al., 1985; Normand and Bouquet, 1989;
Young, 2005). Although not deﬁnitive evidence of phylogenetic
afﬁliation, the nifH sequences detected in borehole 7025-P4 DNA
may be useful in informing the classes of potential nitrogen-ﬁxing
organisms. In Figure 2 the C-type nifH phylotype (n = 2) groups
with Verrucomicrobia nifH, but no 16S rRNA from Verrucomi-
crobia were detected in the DNA of 7025-P4. This phylotype of
nifH may source from the Chlorobi in 7025-P4 DNA, which are
phylogenetically close to Verrucomicrobia by 16S rRNA and nifH
measures. Chlorobi 16S rRNA genes were detected in this sample
(Sahl et al., 2008), although the Henderson nifH and Chlorobi nifH
protein sequences were only 91% similar. A more likely possibility
is that this nif operon was horizontally transferred (Hirsch et al.,
1995) and may not reﬂect the true phylogeny of organisms.

Nitrogen ﬁxation and nitriﬁcation in the granite-hosted subsurface

The B-type nifH phylotype (n = 37) was much more abun-
dant than the C-type phylotype in 7025-P4 DNA, implying the
organisms from which these sequences came from must be much
more abundant in the sample. In fact, the most dominant organ-
ism in this sample by the measure of 16S rRNA gene sequences
(37%) are the novel phylum Henderson candidate division that
were ﬁrst detected in the Henderson environment (Sahl et al.,
2008), and subsequently detected in seaﬂoor basalt (Omoregie
et al., 2008; Santelli et al., 2008). The phylogenetic analysis of Sahl
et al. (2008) demonstrate that the closest related phyla to Hender-
son candidate division are the Acidobacteria and the Nitrospirae.
In Figure 2, the B-type nifH phylotype is similarly related to the
Nitrospirae sequence from T. yellowstonii. There were Nitrospirae
16S rRNA sequences detected in this sample (Sahl et al., 2008), but
they belong speciﬁcally to the Nitrospira genus, whose only repre-
sentative sequenced genome does not contain any homologs to the
nifH gene, suggesting this genus is unlikely to ﬁx nitrogen (Lücker
et al., 2010). There were also Acidobacteria 16S rRNA sequences
detected in the 7025-P4 DNA sample, but of the three sequenced
Acidobacteria genomes, none possess any nif genes (Ward et al.,
2009). The B-type nifH phylotype may source from Henderson
candidate division bacteria, but this phylotype of nifH was not
ampliﬁed from the DNA of borehole 7025-P1, which contained
56% Henderson candidate division 16S rRNA sequences. Without
further investigation of the genome of Henderson candidate divi-
sion or other organisms in borehole 7025-P4, it is unclear which
organisms the B-type or C-type nifH phylotype source from.

HENDERSON FLUIDS SUPPORT NITRIFICATION
The presence of high NH4
and low levels
of O2 (1.25 μM) in borehole 7025-P4 suggest that ammonium
and nitrite oxidation may be occurring. In fact, both of the
reactions of nitriﬁcation, summarized by Eq. 1 and 2 below,
are thermodynamically favorable in borehole 7025-P4 (Swanner,
2011).

Reactions 1 and 2 yield −40 and −35 kJ mol electron transferred,
respectively. In addition, micromolar quantities of gaseous N2O
were detected in 7025-P4. N2O is an intermediate in both micro-
bial nitriﬁcation/denitriﬁcation, and as such is a hallmark of
biological nitrogen cycling. One abiotic mechanism for N2O pro-
duction involves reaction of NO2
with (ultra)maﬁc
rocks and minerals (dolerite, augite, and olivine; Samarkin et al.,
2010), but none of these phases are present at Henderson and so
−
this mechanism is unlikely. N2O can also be produced from NO
in the presence of Fe2+
2
(both observed in the borehole
ﬂuids) within 24 h at pH 6 (Moraghan and Buresh, 1977). There-
fore, even if N2O is abiotically produced, the additional presence of
NO2
strongly implicates either nitriﬁcation or denitriﬁcation in
7025-P4 ﬂuids as a mechanism for continued NO2
production.
Because of the presence of N2O, it is also worth noting that nitrate
reduction coupled to inorganic electron donors is thermodynami-
cally favorable; in contrast, microbially mediated reactions such as
anammox, the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium with nitrite is

less likely in Henderson, due to predicted unfavorable thermody-
namics under insitu conditions (Swanner, 2011). In addition, no
organisms belonging to the phylum Planctomycetes were detected
at Henderson, and only these organisms are currently known to
carry out anammox (Kuenen, 2008). A ﬁnal consideration on the
favorability of nitriﬁcation in the borehole ﬂuids is that the C:N
is near unity, which should drive the consumption of ammo-
nium by nitriﬁcation relative to the assimilation of ammonium
by heterotrophs, because C:N values generally need to be > 20 for
heterotrophic ammonium uptake to predominate (Strauss and
Lambert, 2000). Additionally, inorganic phosphate levels were was
below detection (Sahl et al., 2008), further suggesting that the
borehole ﬂuids are oligotrophic.

The organisms most likely to be carrying out ammonium-
oxidation in borehole 7025-P4 are AOA, as no AOB were detected
in 7025-P4 DNA by 16S rRNA (Sahl et al., 2008). The archaeal
organisms previously detected in borehole 7025-P4 belong to the
phylum Crenarchaeota (Brochier-Armanet et al., 2008; Spang et al.,
2010) as reported in Figure 6 of Sahl et al. (2008). Our re-alignment
of these previously retrieved 16S rRNA sequences with sequences
from other subsurface mines (data not shown) reveal that they are
closely related to other subsurface Crenarchaeota, some of which
have been implicated in archaeal ammonium oxidation (Takai
et al., 2001; Nunoura et al., 2005; Spear et al., 2007; Rastogi et al.,
2010). Four of the six archaeal sequences retrieved from 7025-P4
are 97% identical to Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis, an ammonium-
oxidizing (AOA) isolate (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008), and amoA
genes have been detected and implicated in ammonium oxida-
tion for other closely related organisms within the Crenarchaeota
(Treusch et al., 2004). Our ﬁnding of amoA in DNA of the 7025-P4
borehole that contains high NH4
and organisms closely related
to AOA suggests, in conjunction with the geochemical evidence
for nitriﬁcation, that AOA may be active in subsurface ﬂuids at
Henderson Mine. Furthermore, this study is at least the third to
amplify archaeal amoA from a terrestrial subsurface setting (Spear
et al., 2007; Weidler et al., 2007), and our phylogenetic analysis in
Figure 3 suggests that there may be sub-clusters of amoA deﬁned
by subsurface and hot spring clones (Beman and Francis, 2006;
Zhang et al., 2008). Future subsurface studies may reveal further
AOA and amoA diversity, and will establish the contribution of
these processes at depth to the global nitrogen cycle.

+

+

+

The presence of archaeal amoA in the 7025-P4 DNA sample
and absence of the bacterial version of this gene may be explained
by the geochemical conditions. The sub-millimolar concentration
of NH4
in borehole 7025-P4 is ideal for AOA who are inhibited
by higher concentrations of NH4
(i.e., 2–3 mM). One cultivated
AOA, Nitrosopumilus maritimus has an ammonia monooxygenase
enzyme that reaches maximal activity at NH4
concentrations that
are 100-fold less than those observed for AOB enzymes (Martens-
Habbena et al., 2009). The low-O2 concentrations in 7025-P4 may
favor AOA who thrive when dissolved O2 is 3–20 μM (Ergruder
et al., 2009). The archaea were only detected after packer insertion,
further supporting their adaptation to thrive in low-O2 niches. The
presence of sulﬁde in wastewater reactors and estuary sediments
has an inhibitory effect on the activity of AOB relative to AOA
(Sears et al., 2004; Caffrey et al., 2007), and a similar phenom-
enon has been observed in cultivated AOB (Hooper and Terry,

Nitrogen ﬁxation and nitriﬁcation in the granite-hosted subsurface

1973). Dissolved sulﬁde was not measured in Henderson ﬂuids,
but is likely present due to the extensive sulﬁde mineralization at
Henderson, and the formation of elemental sulfur where bore-
hole ﬂuids are released into oxic mine tunnels (Templeton and
Swanner, unpublished data).

While the Crenarchaeota have only recently been characterized
as AOA (Könnecke et al., 2005), the ensuing widespread detec-
tion of AOA in soils, estuaries and marine environments and their
abundance worldwide relative to AOB signiﬁes that these organ-
isms likely do account for a large portion of both terrestrial and
marine nitrogen cycling (Francis et al., 2007). AOA are also pref-
erentially found in low-nutrient environments (Ergruder et al.,
2009), and they seem to be adapted to higher salinity (Bernhard
et al., 2010), although AOB appear to outnumber AOA in estu-
arine environments regardless of varying nutrient ﬂuxes (Wankel
et al., 2011). AOA are also predominant in environments above
40˚C (Zhao et al., 2011), which is the temperature of Hender-
son ﬂuids. Furthermore, AOA are phylogenetically diverse, and
this diversity may underscore their adaptation to diverse environ-
mental conditions relative to the phylogenetically restricted AOB
(Francis et al., 2005).

AOB and AOA are not the only organisms capable of oxidiz-
ing ammonia. Methanotrophs can also oxidize ammonia due to
the broad substrate speciﬁcity of the enzyme methane monooxy-
genase. However, methanotrophs cannot grow using ammonia as
a substrate, nor can ammonia oxidizers grow using methane as a
substrate (Bédard and Knowles, 1989; Hanson and Hanson, 1996).
Bacterial methanotrophs reside within the α- and γ-Proteobacteria.
Both of these Proteobacterial divisions were detected in borehole
7025-P4 DNA via 16S rRNA, and the ﬂuids from this sample con-
tained submicromolar levels of methane (Sahl et al., 2008). How-
ever, the closest isolated methanotrophs were only 92% related to
the 7025-P4 α-Proteobacteria sequence, and only 86% identical to
the γ-Proteobacteria sequences. Although ammonium-oxidation
by methanotrophs may not be signiﬁcant in Henderson bore-
hole ﬂuids, it could be an important process in other sites were
ammonium and methanotrophs are both abundant, such as a
Japanese gold mine (Hirayama et al., 2005). Methanotrophs could
contribute to subsurface nitrogen cycling by ﬁxing nitrogen as
well (Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Auman et al., 2001). The ability
to ﬁx nitrogen may confer a selective advantage for methanotrophs
inhabiting low-nutrient subsurface habitats, as is hypothesized for
a Japanese uranium mine (Mills et al., 2010).

The nitriﬁcation pathway may be carried to completion by the
nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira genus (Daims et al., 2001). 16S rRNA
sequences belonging to the Nitrospira genus were detected in bore-
hole 7025-P4 DNA (1% of the microbial community; Sahl et al.,
2008). As was the case with AOA, Nitrospira were not detected in
the DNA of borehole 7025-D1/P1. The Nitrospira sequences from
7025-P4 are distinct at the phylum level from the Henderson can-
didate division proposed for unique sequences detected in DNA
from both boreholes at the Henderson 7025 level (D1/P1 and P4;
Sahl et al., 2008). In the current analysis in Figure 5, the Nitro-
spira sequences detected from 7025-P4 DNA group closely with a
clone from a deep gold mine (Gihring et al., 2006), but apart from
other identiﬁed clusters of Nitrospira (Daims et al., 2001; Lebe-
deva et al., 2011). The bootstrap values that support this topology

are all >90%, suggesting that Henderson sequences may deﬁne a
novel cluster of subsurface Nitrospira. All sequences included in
this analysis were longer than 800 bp.

Despite the limited sequence data available for the Nitro-
spira nxrB gene, which encodes the nitrite oxidoreductase, the
primers of Lücker et al. (2010) did successfully amplify nxrB from
the DNA sample of 7025-P4. As 7025-P4 DNA did not con-
tain any 16S rRNA sequences corresponding to Proteobacterial
nitrite-oxidizers (i.e., Nitrobacter, Nitrococcus, and Nitrospina), it
is possible the nxrB sequences we ampliﬁed are from Nitrospira
spp. Because of the high similarity of the amino acid sequence
of the ampliﬁed genes to that of the Ca. Nitrospira deﬂuvii nxrB
and the high bootstrap values supporting this relationship, it is
likely 7025-P4 nxrB clones 74 and 122 are actual Nitrospira nxrB
sequences (Figure 4). Alternatively, this sequence could encode a
related nar gene or a nxrB gene from Proteobacteria, but this is
unlikely as no nitrifying Proteobacteria were detected in this sam-
ple. However, without direct evidence from longer sequences of the
Nitrospira genome in borehole 7025-P4 DNA, it cannot be estab-
lished that the nxrB genes from this study belong to Nitrospira
genus, and the sample limitations discussed above prohibit fur-
ther genetic analysis. The nxrB sequences retrieved in this study
may be useful in future primer design and acquisition of qual-
ity environmental sequence data for Nitrospira, which will aid in
understanding the evolutionary history of the enzymes involved
in nitrite/nitrate oxidation and reduction and the organisms that
possess them.

The presence of Nitrospira in borehole 7025-P4 offers insight
into the ecology of these organisms. Three pure cultures consist
of obligately lithotrophic nitrite-oxidizers from the genus Nitro-
spira (Watson et al., 1986; Ehrich et al., 1995; Lebedeva et al.,
2008, 2011). The cultures were isolated out of both freshwater and
marine habitats (Koops and Pommerening-Röser, 2001), as well
as hot springs (Lebedeva et al., 2011), suggesting the ecology of
this genus is not limited to one type of geochemical environment.
The abundance of Nitrospira in nitrite-oxidizing environments
in comparison to nitrite-oxidizers of the Proteobacterial nitrite-
oxidizers (i.e., Nitrobacter) is evidence for their contribution to
nitrite oxidation in a number of environments (Daims et al., 2001).
The Nitrospira genus seems to be inhibited by higher concen-
trations of nitrite (i.e., >5–15 mM; Ehrich et al., 1995; Lebedeva
et al., 2011) and O2 (Altmann et al., 2003) than are preferred by
Nitrobacter species (Ehrich et al., 1995; Daims et al., 2006), sug-
gesting Nitrospira may be preferentially adapted to oligotrophic
conditions such as are experienced in borehole 7025-P4. Nitro-
spira have now been detected in three subsurface settings where
O2 was <10 μM and NO2
did not exceed 120 μM (i.e., borehole
7025-P4; Hirayama et al., 2005; Weidler et al., 2007), although they
have also been detected in subsurface ﬂuids with millimolar con-
centrations of NO2
but low-O2 (Gihring et al., 2006). Nitrospira
may well be quite common in subsurface settings that contain
NO2
, and future investigations may uncover more phylogenetic
and physiological knowledge about this important genus.

genetic capacity to ﬁx nitrogen. This ﬁxed nitrogen, as ammonium,
is likely to be the primary nitrogen source for organisms living in
the subsurface, as no evidence was found that ammonium was
sourced geologically from NH4
-bearing potassic minerals such
as biotites. Although the presence of nifH genes in borehole 7025-
P4 is only indirect evidence that nitrogen ﬁxation is occurring, it
is also correlates to elevated NH4
concentrations and the lack of
+
nifH in boreholes with lower NH4
concentrations. If nitrogen
ﬁxation is occurring at Henderson it highlights the phenomenon
of excess nitrogen ﬁxation under energy–poor conditions. The
availability of ammonium, regardless of the ultimate source, also
has important consequences for the subsurface microbial com-
munity not only as an essential nutrient but because it can also be
used as an energy source. There is evidence for ammonium and
nitrite oxidation in borehole 7025-P4 where ammonium concen-
trations are highest based on the detection of archaeal ammonia
monooxygenase (amoA) and nitrite oxidoreductase (nxrB) func-
tional genes. While other subsurface studies have detected genes

encoding for both steps of nitriﬁcation (Hirayama et al., 2005;
Weidler et al., 2007), neither study addressed the source of ammo-
nium fueling this process. Moreover, the nxrB sequences detected
from borehole 7025-P4 are the ﬁrst ampliﬁed from the Nitro-
spira genus in environmental samples. The presence of nitriﬁers
3000 feet below the surface at Henderson also reinforces the idea
that Crenarchaea and Nitrospira may be adapted to low nutrient
and substrate environments and could be key players in nitro-
gen cycling in similar settings. Thus this also work highlights the
potential that biological nitrogen ﬁxation and nitriﬁcation may
be ubiquitous biogeochemical processes in the deep subsurface
and maybe important to consider in accounts of global nitrogen
cycling.
