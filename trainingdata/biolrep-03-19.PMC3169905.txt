Abstract
Exactly 50 years ago, biochemists raised the question of the mechanism of the conformational change
that mediates “allosteric” interactions between regulatory sites and biologically active sites in
regulatory/receptor proteins. Do the different conformations involved already exist spontaneously in
the absence of the regulatory ligands (Monod-Wyman-Changeux), such that the complementary
protein conformation would be selected to mediate signal transduction, or do particular ligands
induce the receptor to adopt the conformation best suited to them (Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer—
induced fit)? This is not just a central question for biophysics, it also has enormous importance for
drug design. Recent advances in techniques have allowed detailed experimental and theoretical
comparisons with the formal models of both scenarios. Also,
it has been shown that mutated
receptors can adopt constitutively active confirmations in the absence of ligand. There have also been
demonstrations that the atomic resolution structures of the same protein are essentially the same
whether ligand is bound or not. These and other advances in past decades have produced a situation
where the vast majority of the data using different categories of regulatory proteins (including
regulatory enzymes, ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and nuclear receptors)
support the conformational selection scheme of signal transduction.

Introduction
A central issue for the cybernetics of living organisms,
and consequently for drug design, is how do regulatory
ligands (e.g., metabolites, neurotransmitters, and hor-
mones) control biochemical reactions by binding to
specific regulatory sites on specialized proteins or
receptors? The hypothesis that a conformational change
in the protein mediates such “allosteric” interactions
between regulatory sites and biologically active sites was
proposed exactly 50 years ago [1]. The mechanism that
controls this conformational change was a key issue then
and remains a central question of protein biophysics,
with enormous importance for the design of drugs. Do
the differing conformations involved already exist
spontaneously in the absence of the regulatory ligands,
so that the complementary conformation for a ligand
would be selected to mediate signal transduction, or do
particular ligands induce the receptor to adopt their

adequate conformation (induced fit)? Clearly,
if the
former is the case, it may be possible to design drugs
to stabilize a particular conformation, from a possible
spectrum of states, possessing the desired biological
activity.

This fundamental question has a long history, dating
back to the controversy between Lamarck and Darwin
about the evolution of species. An early example of this
controversy took place in the early 20th century, when
many new antigens were discovered, and most immu-
nologists had difficulty accepting the notion that
antibodies against all
the many possible antigens
preexist in an organism. The so-called instructive theory
of antibody formation, advanced notably by Linus
Pauling, postulated that the antigen plays a matrix role
from which antibody molecules acquired a specific
configuration [2]. Alternative mechanisms were not

established until over 40 years later when Tonegawa
demonstrated that a wide variety of antibodies against
potential antigens are in fact continuously synthesized in
the organism through somatic gene recombination [3].
The antigen does not perform an instructive role, but
participates in the selection of a complementary anti-
body. Generally, in biological sciences, the instructive
model has been (and is still) commonly used to describe
the relationships between living organisms and the
outside world. However, convincing experimental evi-
dence rarely, if ever, shows that the environment leaves a
direct inheritable “imprint” on the organism.

For proteins other than antibodies, Koshland’s 1959
induced-fit theory of enzyme action [4] did not, at the
time it was proposed, concern the regulation of enzyme
activity by a metabolic signal, only the specificity of
enzyme action. His view was that a “steric fit” was
essential for the reaction and that such a “fit occurred
only after a change in shape of the enzyme molecule had
been induced by the substrate.” Such an “instructive”
mechanism was also initially suggested in 1963 to
account for the conformational change mediating signal
transduction in bacterial regulatory enzymes [5].

It was within this background that in 1965 a paradig-
matic shift from instruction to selection occurred—from
“the pressure of
facts”—with the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux proposal (extended in 1966 by Rubin and
Changeux) of a model postulating a small number of
discrete conformational states independent of
ligand
structure and occupancy [6,7]. The Monod-Wyman-
Changeux model provided a substantial economy of
means and explained simply many kinetic properties of
native enzymes, in particular cooperative ligand binding
and its regulation. Specifically, it posed two unifying
concepts: (a) regulatory proteins have a quaternary
structure with identical subunits symmetrically organized
into finite assemblies (oligomers); and (b) oligomers
undergo reversible transitions between a small number of
discrete conformations, which primarily affect the qua-
ternary organization, preserve its symmetry, and are
accessible in the absence of ligand. In this model, ligands
selectively stabilize the state to which they preferen-
tially bind, and thereby trigger signal transduction. In
its initial formulation, the Monod-Wyman-Changeux
model dealt with protein oligomers to account for the
positive cooperative phenomena (and oligomeric
structure) encountered with most regulatory proteins.
A more general formulation was suggested in 1967 by
Changeux et al. [8] based upon the conformational
transition of a single protomer modulated or not by
the interaction with other protomers in a membrane
lattice. This model thus lays the ground for a general

thermodynamic mechanism of “conformational selec-
tion” subsequently elaborated by Burgen and others
[9-13].

The Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Changeux et al.
(1967) models contrast with the Koshland-Nemethy-
Filmer sequential, induced-fit mechanism, which posits
that proteins can adopt multiple conformational states,
including stable “intermediate” (or mixed states), with
tertiary changes complementary to ligand structures and
caused by ligand binding. This model
involves “a
progressive change” of conformation and it is assumed
that a subunit adopts the required conformation only
when the ligand is bound to it [14]. We will discuss
several recent advances that have made it possible in
recent years to distinguish between these two models.
One is to use new techniques to measure whether the
structure and kinetics of proteins behave as predicted by
one model or the other and can be quantitatively fitted
by one model and not by the other.

Thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand-
dependent protein conformational changes
The appropriate equations for the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux and Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer models have
been derived and the effect of individual parameters on
the shapes and positions of
ligand binding and
conformational states curves established in forms con-
venient for testing using experimental data. A critical, yet
simple, difference between the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux and Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer models is
that the binding and conformational state functions
would most often differ in the Monod-Wyman-Chan-
geux model while being systematically superimposed in
the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model. Theoretical
approaches combining features of both models have
also been proposed [15].

A simple scheme (Figure 1) illustrates the two models; one
for a monomeric protein and one for a minimal dimeric
protein with identical sites. According to the Monod-
Wyman-Changeux model, two conformational states
(denoted T0 and R0) are in spontaneous equilibrium,
with T0 favored in the absence of ligand (X), as set by the
isomerization constant L0 = [T0]/[R0] > 1. Since the R state
has a higher affinity for X than that of the T state, the
population of protein molecules will swing in favor of R as
ligand is bound. The path through the states depends on
the ligand concentration. For relatively high concentra-
tions of X, the left column will predominate (leading to
the reaction pathway for dimers of T0 → T1 → T2 → R2),
since binding to T0 is more rapid than repopulating R0.
However, at low concentrations of X, formation of R0
may be sufficiently rapid for binding to utilize mainly

energy scale and include the transition state (TS) kinetic barriers for their
interconversion, estimated according to linear free energy principles for the
dimer [17]. Subscripts correspond to the number of ligand molecules (X)
bound. The T–R transitions follow the Monod-Wyman-Changeux principles
for the dimer [6] or those of Changeux et al. [8] for the monomer. The
pathway for the induced-fit mechanism [14] is presented by the dashed
arrows in yellow and includes an intermediate (I) state for the dimer.

the states of the right column (leading to the reaction
pathway for dimers of R0 → R1 → R2). A similar argument
was recently presented to distinguish induced fit (T0 → T1
→ R1) and conformational selection (T0 → R0 → R1) for a
monomeric protein [11,12], but an orthodox induced-fit
model would not include R0 so their model is identical to
the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. Moreover, since
the analysis was restricted to monomers (omitting the
essential assumption on the quaternary organization of
the protein), a key difference related to intermediate states
could not be considered. As shown in Figure 1 for the
hypothetical dimeric protein, only the induced-fit type
mechanism in the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model leads
to a mixed intermediate state, designated as I1.

Another distinguishing feature of the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux model is the kinetics of the allosteric transi-
tions. In addition to the left (T state) and right (R state)
columns of Figure 1, a central column is shown to
represent the transition states for the conformational
transitions. The logic of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux
model implies equally spaced energy steps for binding of
ligand to each state, as illustrated for the hypothetical
dimer. It thus also implies equally spaced energies for
each transition state (TS), characterized by a TS-
positional parameter that fixes the spacing as T-like,

Attention to this principle can aid in avoiding postulat-
ing improbable reaction mechanisms, as recently illu-
strated for pentameric ligand-gated channels [16].

Methods to investigate the relationships between
ligand binding and protein conformation
X-ray crystallography is commonly used to determine the
structure of large proteins at sufficient resolution to
provide coordinates for its atoms. Since proteins must be
crystallized, particular conformations of the protein in
solution may be selected, in addition to the constraints
imposed on protein conformation by the crystal
structure. Independent techniques are thus needed to
probe the distinction between conformational selection
and induced fit;
ligand binding by
hemoglobin, these include fast spectroscopic techniques
such as laser flash photolysis of the carbon monoxide
adduct of hemoglobin and time-resolved resonance
Raman, which is sensitive to structural relaxation close
to the hemes, as well as time-resolved ultraviolet
resonance Raman,
time-resolved circular dichroism,
and time-resolved magnetic circular dichroism [18]. In
addition, time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-
WAXS) has been used to accurately probe structural
changes of hemoglobin in solution with nanosecond
time resolution, as discussed below [19]. Finally, in silico
molecular dynamics techniques allow detailed time and
space resolution into representative behavior for care-
fully selected systems. Probing the relationship between
molecular structure, movement, and function in mole-
cular dynamics simulations represent an interface
between laboratory experiments and theory that can be
understood as a “virtual experiment”, and are especially
useful
to distinguish conformational selection from
induced fit.

Experimental evidence for selected examples
Hemoglobin
Studies on the cooperative binding of oxygen by
hemoglobin in many respects paved the way to the
understanding of the role of conformational changes in
protein regulation [20]. The first models naturally relied
on an induced-fit–sequential mechanism with the

pioneering work of Adair relating the sigmoid oxygen
binding curve with the tetrameric nature of the hemo-
globin molecule [21] and Pauling’s introduction of the
concept of heme–heme interactions, with progressively
enhanced energy of oxygen binding, including three
distinct intermediate states with one, two, and three O2
bound [22].

The elucidation of the X-ray structures of oxy- and deoxy-
hemoglobin by Perutz and his colleagues (1960–1964)
as a symmerical a2b2 tetramer almost coincided with the
proposal of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. In
1970, Perutz tried to apply the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux conformational selection scheme to hemoglo-
bin (see [23]) and Edelstein’s quantitative model soon
followed [24]. Perutz interpreted the hemoglobin data in
terms of an equilibrium between a tense structure (T)
with low oxygen affinity (the predominant conforma-
tion at low oxygen pressure) constrained by salt bridges
between the C-termini of the four subunits, and a relaxed
structure (R) with high oxygen affinity (the predominant
conformation at high oxygen pressure) lacking the salt
bridges. The equilibrium was suggested to be governed
primarily by the position of the iron atoms relative to the
porphyrin plane: out-of-plane in five-coordinated, high-
spin deoxyhemoglobin, and in-plane in six-coordinated,
low-spin oxyhemoglobin, with the tension exercised by
the salt bridges in the T-structure transmitted to the
heme-linked histidines to restrain the movement of the
iron atoms into the porphyrin plane that is necessary for
oxygen binding. The variations of the oxygen equili-
brium curve of hemoglobin with pH, ionic strength, and
allosteric effectors could be described by a simplified
Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, but according to
Perutz, the Bohr effect and the linearity of proton release
with early oxygen uptake would require a sequential
rupture of hydrogen bonds in the T-structure. Locally
“induced” changes would then follow oxygen binding.
In the case of fish hemoglobins, the O2 binding curves at
low pH appear drastically “anti-cooperative” (Hill
coefficient, n ≪ 1) and such negative cooperativity has
been often reported in the biochemical literature as
supporting the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model. Yet,
heterogeneity between the two types of chains can
readily lead to such behavior [25], which becomes
extreme at acidic pH for certain fish hemoglobins,
reconciling the data with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux
scheme [26].

Detailed kinetic measurements using fast spectroscopy
placed the rate of the conformational transition in the
range of tens of ms and were fully consistent with the
Monod-Wyman-Changeux model [27]. Recently, TR-
WAXS revealed that the main structural change takes

place much faster, in the 2-ms range, after photolysis of
CO-hemoglobin [19]. An early transition signal already
fully developed at 300 ns, corresponding to a tertiary
relaxation to be followed by a main quaternary relaxa-
tion likely involving the ab dimers relative rotation and
translation occurring in a concerted way at about 2 ms.
The authors assigned this effect to the R to T quaternary
transition, insisting on the fact that the partially ligated
states present under their conditions do not modify the
pattern. The 20-ms step observed with time-resolved
optical spectroscopy would then correspond to a smaller
and localized structural change.

In silico calculations based on the method of conjugate
peak refinement are consistent with such a two-step
quaternary transition [28]. In the R to T direction the full
quaternary transition separates into two distinct phases:
an early large quaternary change (characterized by a 3°
rotation of each a-subunit relative to the b1b2-dimer),
with a lower energy barrier postulated to correspond to
the 2-ms step, and a smaller late quaternary change
(characterized by a 6° rotation of the a1b1- and the a2b2-
dimers) with a higher energy barrier postulated to
correspond to the 20-ms step. Although the T–R transi-
tion was initially reported to involve very little change at
the tertiary level [29], the “quaternary constraint” (as
described in Monod-Wyman-Changeux), must naturally
be driven by underlying tertiary changes.
Indeed,
evidence for this concept has been presented by using
silica gels to trap unstable intermediates of hemoglobin
[30], indicating that a fraction of liganded hemoglobin
subunits blocked by the gel in a quaternary T state
display R-state kinetic properties.

Overall, the current understanding of the binding of oxygen
to hemoglobin adds details to the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux model by incorporating tertiary transitions and
explicitly representing coupling between tertiary and
quaternary levels. Overall, the conformational selection
scheme largely accounts for the paradigmatic example of
the cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, possibly
with some small elements of induced fit limited to the
immediate vicinity of the ligand-binding sites.

Aspartate transcarbamylase
Together with L-threonine deaminase [1], aspartate
transcarbamoylase had a significant place in the early
studies on allosteric proteins [31,32]. Escherichia coli
aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzes the initial step in
pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis:
the reaction of
carbamoyl phosphate with L-aspartate (Asp) to form
N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate. The
enzyme is composed of two types of subunits: the two
larger catalytic subunits are each composed of three

identical polypeptide chains (Mr=34,000), while the
three smaller regulatory subunits are each composed of
two identical polypeptide chains (Mr=17,000). Each of
the six active sites is located at the interface between two
adjacent catalytic chains. The enzyme displays homo-
tropic cooperativity for the substrate Asp and is hetero-
tropically regulated by the effectors ATP, CTP and UTP in
the presence of CTP.

Early tests of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model with
aspartate transcarbamoylase involved the comparison,
under equilibrium conditions, between the equilibrium
binding of
the substrate analog succinate and the
corresponding changes in the enzyme conformation
monitored by following p-mercury benzoate reactivity
and the sedimentation coefficient. The conformational
alterations were found to approach completion at
succinate concentrations, which only partially saturate
the specific binding sites, excluding the precise super-
imposition between ligand binding and conformational
change expected from the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer
model but quantitatively accommodated by the Monod-
Wyman-Changeux scheme [33,34].

The structures of the low-activity T state (in the absence of
substrates) and high-activity R state (in the presence of
substrates or substrate analogs such as N-phosphonacetyl-
L-aspartate) have been determined by X-ray crystallogra-
phy [35,36]. A comparison of the T and R structures reveals
that during the T → R transition, the two catalytic trimers
increase their separation along the 3-fold axis by about 11
Å and rotate about 5° around the same axis, while the
regulatory dimers rotate about 15° around their respective
2-fold axes [35].

Using highly deuterated, 1H,13C-methyl-labeled aspar-
tate transcarbamoylase in concert with methyl-transverse
relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) nuclear
magnetic resonance, the shift from the T to the R state
of the enzyme can be quantitatively monitored, allowing
the equilibrium constant (L0) between R and T forms of
the enzyme to be measured quantitatively [37]. The
titration data establish unequivocally that both carba-
moyl phosphate and its non-hydrolyzable analogue
phosphonoacetamide, as well as the bisubstrate analo-
gue phosphonoacetyl-L-aspartate, shift the equilibrium
toward R and thus bind preferentially to this state. The
presence of significant populations of both R and T
conformers in the phosphonoacetamide-saturated
enzyme allows a straightforward determination of the
shift of the R–T equilibrium toward R upon addition of
ATP and conversely, the complete disappearance of the R
conformer from spectra with CTP. Such changes are in
agreement with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model

for both homo- and heterotropic effects, where binding
of substrate analogs and ATP to the R state is favored and
binding of CTP to the T state is preferred.

The 11-Å expansion of the enzyme observed during the
T → R transition has also been monitored by small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) [38,39]. Although the T con-
formation was practically identical in solution and in the
crystal, differences were observed in the R conformation
[40]. For instance, the distance between the two catalytic
trimers was found to be 2.8 Å larger than in the crystal
structure. A salt link was observed only in the low-
activity,
low-affinity T-state quaternary structure,
between Lys-143 of the regulatory chain and Asp-236
of the catalytic chain. Its disruption by an Asp-236-Ala
mutation yielded an interesting enzyme. SAXS reveals a
spontaneous and reversible equilibrium between the
R and T states in solution, and in the absence of ligand,
critical evidence in favor of the conformational selection
mechanism [41].

The quaternary change observed during the T → R transition
has been monitored by SAXS at a time resolution as short as
5 ms [39]. After mixing with substrates or substrate analogs
at 5°C it appeared to be a single phase under some
conditions and biphasic under other conditions. Most
strikingly, after addition of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate
to the enzyme, the transition rate was more than one order
of magnitude slower than with the natural substrates.
The results on the homotropic interactions are consistent
with a concerted transition between structural and func-
tional states of different affinity and activity for aspartate.
Addition of ATP along with the substrates increased the
rate of the transition from the T to the R state and also
decreased the duration of the R-state steady-state phase.
Addition of CTP or the combination of CTP/UTP to the
substrates significantly decreased the rate of the T → R
transition and caused a shift in the enzyme population
towards the T state. These results suggest a destabilization
of the T state by ATP and a destabilization of the R state
by CTP and CTP/UTP, consistent with the T- and R-state
crystallographic structures. The data are adequately fit by a
simplified equation derived for the two-state Monod-
Wyman-Changeux model. With aspartate transcarbamoy-
lase as with hemoglobin, convergent data from different
groups are thus consistent, at
the present stage of
investigation, with the conformational selection scheme.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
We can attribute the muscle target for nicotine and curare
to the original definition in 1905 by Langley [42] of a
receptor for a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) and the
characterization of its ionic response as the opening of a

Gopfert and Schaefer and by Eccles in the 1930s, long
before the molecule was suggested to be an allosteric
membrane protein [43,44] and identified from fish
electric organ [45,46]. Convergent structural and bio-
chemical data [47] show that nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors are integral membrane proteins with a mole-
cular mass of ~290 kDa, forming a cylinder of ~8 nm in
diameter and ~16 nm in length comprising five identical
or homologous subunits symmetrically arranged around
a central
ionic channel. Each subunit consists of a
large N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane
(TM) domain comprising four segments (TM1–TM4),
and a variable cytoplasmic domain. There are 2–5
acetylcholine-binding sites within the extracellular
domain,
located at the boundary between subunits,
and topographically distinct from the functionally linked
cationic ion channel, located on the axis of symmetry of
the transmembrane domain and bordered by the TM2
helices. The TM1 and TM3 segments and especially TM4
contact
lipid molecules in the plasma membrane.
The crystal structures at high resolution (ca. 3Å) of
recently identified bacterial homologues of nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors reveal a striking conservation of
secondary and tertiary motifs that include the extra-
cellular domain b-sandwich and the four transmem-
brane a-helices [48,49]. Together they delineate a core
is conserved in the superfamily from
structure that
prokaryotes to eukaryotes, demonstrating that
the
interactions between acetylcholine sites and ion
channels occur between topographically distinct sites and
are thus typically allosteric [50]. The issue of conformational
selection versus induced fit is raised by the mechanism of
ion-channel opening by acetylcholine since, as expected, the
early models that were proposed [51] were based on the
sequential scheme, the open-channel state always being an
agonist-bound state. The following arguments support the
view that
the conformational selection model more
adequately fits the available data.

(a) Patch-clamp recordings of nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors at the neuromuscular junction reveal, in the
presence of acetylcholine, discrete stochastic current jumps
between a low and a maximum unitary current corre-
sponding to closed and open states of a single ion channel
[51] (even if single “openings” of the ion channel are
actually interrupted by brief closed periods and occasional
channels found of smaller amplitude than the usual [full]
open-channel current). The rise times are within a msec and
the duration of the steady current in the msec time scale.
The durations of the full openings are found to vary with
the nature and binding affinity of the agonist, but not the
maximum unitary current or intrinsic conductance,
indicating the invariance of the all-or-none ionic gating
response with the structure of the ligand.

(b) Spontaneous channel openings can be recorded in
the absence of acetylcholine [52], and the antagonist a-
bungarotoxin causes the frequency of openings to decay
with time, results that are inconsistent with a mechanism
by which the ligand “induces” the opening of
the
channel.

(c) Mutations were discovered initially in the channel
domain a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [53], but
also scattered throughout the receptor. These mutations
enhance the response of the receptor to acetylcholine
and promote spontaneous channel openings (some of
them naturally occurring and causing human disease
such as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal
lobe
epilepsy and congenital myasthenia). Systematic ana-
lyses of
they alter the
unliganded equilibrium between discrete channel states
(open and closed) but not the energy from ligand
binding. They are accounted for by the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux model [54], providing strong evidence for the
conformational selection scheme for acetylcholine
receptor gating by acetylcholine.

these mutations show that

(d) In silico normal-mode analysis application to a model
of a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, based on the then-
available structural data, shows that the lower frequency
mode corresponds to a global quaternary twist motion of
the protein [55], resulting from a tilt of each subunit that
causes anticlockwise motion in the upper part of the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pentamer. This motion
occurs concomitantly with a bending of the subunits at
their extracellular domain–transmembrane domain
interface, a pore dilatation over its entire length and a
structural reorganization of the acetylcholine-binding
site. The twist mode accounts for key features of receptor
channel opening and closing by agonists and antago-
nists, and for key features of the above mentioned
mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
[55,56]. The atomic mechanism of channel opening
can be seen using the X-ray structures of the bacterial
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor homologs stabilized in
closed versus open conformation. Despite low sequence
identity (18%), their common core structure undergoes a
quaternary twist, similar to that described above, that
contributes to at
the closed to open
transition, and each subunit undergoes tertiary deforma-
tions. These deformations involve a substantial rearran-
gement of
interfaces and a downward
motion of the b1–b2 loop. This is apparently coupled
to a tilt of the TM2 and TM3 segments and generates a
wide opening in the upper part of the pore (from 2 to 12
Å diameter) [48]. The recently determined structure of
the homopentameric glutamate-gated ionic channel-a

[57] further reveals an unanticipated superimposition
with the previously identified Gloeobacter receptor
structure [48,49], thus supporting the striking invariance
of a channel-gating transition stabilized by chemically
unrelated ligands of proteins that are very distant

(e) One advantage of the electrophysiological recordings
of ligand-gated ion channels is that they reach similar
time ranges as TR-WAXS with hemoglobin, giving one
hope that
the
intrinsic conformational change that mediates signal
transduction in the presence (or absence) of ligand and
answer some outstanding questions. How does the
cooperative transition proceed in an oligomeric protein?
Are there “intermediate” or “flip” states involved? One-
microsecond molecular dynamics simulation of
the
Gloeobacter receptor reveals a channel closure initiated
by local but large fluctuations in the pore that take place
at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary
relaxation resulting in a quaternary twist of the whole
molecule [58]. Future investigations should determine
whether or not the simulation matches the structural
data within the appropriate time scale. In addition, fast
and slow desensitization processes have been identified
in muscular and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors within a broad range of time scales that imply
different local conformations within both transmembrane
domains and extracellular domains [47,59]. Additional
conformational states still need to be added to the Monod-
Wyman-Changeux scheme for these data to fit [17,60],
within the conformational selection scheme.

(f) Last but not least, abundant structural studies have
identified the three-dimensional structure of a broad
diversity of nicotinic ligands bound to the acetylcholine
binding site of the acetylcholine receptor or an acetylcho-
line-binding protein homolog from mollusk [61]. Other
investigations focused on the stabilization of
the
pyridine in nicotine, where the unprotonated nitrogen
is a hydrogen-bond acceptor for stabilizing this ring [62].
It seems that a network of H2O molecules is stabilized
and connects to solvent in the vestibule. In turn, polar
side chains in the receptor and acetylcholine-binding
protein are involved. Little if any “induced-fit” reorgani-
zation is detected at this level of resolution within the
site with ligand binding, with the notable exception of a
C-loop motion that primarily maps the size of the bound
ligand. Acetylcholine-binding protein possesses a
rigid organization and lacks the complement of con-
formational changes associated with acetylcholine recep-
tor activation. On the other hand, rigid body docking
procedures with the quaternary twist model of acetylcho-
line receptor conformational transition [55] reveal a

complex between the antagonist a-cobratoxin and
muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that matches
the basal “resting” state conformation of the receptor but
not its active open-channel conformation, in agreement
with the experimental data suggesting a “closing” of the
binding site during gating (twist mode) [63]. In other
words,
in silico simulation and empirical data are
consistent with a conformational selection model.
Further studies are, however, needed for a deeper
understanding of
the (probably multiple) allosteric
transitions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to
account for the activation and desensitization processes
together with the relevant design of pharmacologically
efficient drugs.

ligands,

G protein-coupled receptors
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class
of cell-surface receptors, are activated by a diverse range
of
including hormones, neurotransmitters,
ions, odorants, and photons of light. Once activated,
they couple to a wide range of signaling molecules and
effector systems. GPCRs are encoded by about 800
genes in humans and are the target of many therapeutic
agents that are currently in use. X-ray crystallography
structures of GPCRs are characterized by seven-trans-
membrane helices and an eighth helix that
lies
approximately parallel to the intracellular membrane,
as well as substantial variations in functionally diver-
gent regions—especially on the extracellular side of the
receptor, which is responsible for ligand interactions.
Binding of small extracellular ligands modulates the
capacity of GPCRs to catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in
heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins
(G proteins Gabg) at the distant site facing the cell
interior. Signal transduction mediated by GPCRs is thus,
by definition, allosteric. A rich literature exists on
GPCR-mediated signal transduction and only a few
features relevant to the allosteric transition mechanism
shall be mentioned here:

(a) GPCRs can adopt multiple oligomeric states
The relationship between the formation of GPCR homo-
or hetero-dimers and signal transduction is still debated,
and may vary with the GPCR class (A, B, or C) [64-69].
Rhodopsin and the b2-adrenergic receptor, which belong
to class A GPCRs, signal efficiently through G proteins
when reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs containing only
a single receptor molecule, and thus, these class A GPCRs
may function without the need for oligomerization.
Numerous studies, however, have revealed more com-
plex activation mechanisms due to the ability of diverse
GPCRs to adopt several conformations, each linked
to specific signaling cascades (see section below:
(d) Different ligands may activate different pathways in

http://f1000.com/reports/b/3/19

b-adrenergic receptors) and to form dimers or even larger
oligomeric complexes offering new signaling possibili-
ties. For instance, for the class A serotonin receptor 5HT4,
activation of one protomer in a dimer is sufficient for G-
protein activation, but coupling efficiency increases by
100% when both protomers are activated [70]. For the
class C metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) and GABAB
receptors, dimerization is mandatory for
receptor
activation: the mGlu receptor forms homodimers stabi-
lized by an inter-subunit disulphide bridge and
the GABAB receptor is an obligatory heterodimer
(GABAB1+GABAB2). Furthermore, time-resolved fluores-
cence resonance energy transfer experiments show that
GABAB heterodimers can form stable tetramers (that are
present in the brain) with a decrease of G protein-
coupling efficiency [71]. Recently, in one among many
examples, a model system of a GPCR heteromer
consisting of m and d opioid receptors was established,
showing that m receptor ligands are capable of allosteri-
cally enhancing d receptor radioligand binding and vice
versa, suggesting an allosteric receptor model [72].
Abundant investigations are currently in progress to
evaluate the functional significance of
these diverse
allosteric interactions as an uncharted landscape for drug
development [66], within the conformational selection
scheme.

(b) GPCR mutations can make them constitutively active
without ligands
More than 40% of all wild-type GPCRs tested exhibit con-
stitutive basal activity [73], including the b2-adrenergic,
H3 histamine, ghrelin, and the thyroid-stimulating
hormone receptors; see [74] for review. Recent evidence
for spontaneous visual pigment activation (or dark
noise) has also been presented [75]. Mutations in
GPCRs cause more than 30 different human diseases,
and among them about 100 are constitutive mutations
that are themselves responsible for more than 10
diseases (including congenital stationary night blindness
for rhodopsin or Kaposi’s sarcoma for KSVH-GPCR)
[74]. The a1b-adrenergic receptor was the first GPCR in
which point mutations were shown to trigger receptor
activation in the absence of agonist [76]. To extend the
generality of
this finding, similar mutations were
performed in the b2- and a2-adrenergic receptors,
which are coupled to Gs-mediated stimulation or
Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, respectively
[77-79]. Both b2- and a2-receptor mutants exhibited
increased constitutive activity leading to increased or
decreased agonist-independent adenylyl cyclase activity,
respectively. Since then, spontaneously occurring activat-
ing mutations have been discovered in various GPCRs,
including rhodopsin, that are responsible for a number
of human diseases [80]. The constitutive effects of these

mutations, together with basal activity and its shift
toward the resting conformation by negative allosteric
modulators (awkwardly named “inverse agonists”)
shown by many of the receptors, was interpreted by
Lefkowitz and colleagues [81] in terms of an adapted
version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux scheme. The
spontaneous equilibrium between R and R* and the
relevant value of L would allow a significant level of R*
to be present in the absence of agonist. The equilibrium
would be further shifted in favor of R* as a consequence
of a constitutive mutation or saturating concentrations of
agonist, with the amplitude of the shift depending on the
consequences of the mutation on the value of L. As
discussed for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [82,83],
the occurrence of such constitutive mutations that yield
active receptor molecules in the absence of agonist rules
out the “induced-fit” mechanism of receptor activation.

(c) Resting and active conformations of GPCRs have common
X-ray structures
the
In addition to the spontaneous occurrence of
activation transition, recent X-ray crystallography struc-
tures for rhodopsin, b-adrenergic, and adenosine A2A
GPCRs in antagonist-resting versus agonist-bound states
with a variety of
ligands show a similar global
conformation, and this suggests that GPCRs have a
common activation mechanism that is independent of
the structure of the ligand bound—see references in
[84,85]. Rhodopsin structures have been of immense
value for understanding the activation transition. Rho-
dopsin’s structure is stabilized by multiple hydrogen
bonding networks within the seven-transmembrane core
involving structurally bound water molecules and
conserved motifs forming an “ionic lock” in GPCRs
that constrains TM3 and TM6. The recent structures
solved for rhodopsin and non-rhodopsin GPCRs in the
active and resting conformations reveal a slightly
increased distance between TM3 and TM6, which is
sufficient to break the ionic lock that appears to be a
common prerequisite for an active receptor state. Non-
rhodopsin GPCR structures show, in addition to a highly
variable organization of the ligand-binding domain, a
larger diversity among the extracellular ends of the TM
segments and conformations of the connecting loops.
Yet, common features emerge from this diversity. For
instance, residues in the binding pocket that interact with
the ligand are, as in the case of nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, more contracted or compact in the active
conformation (helices III, V, and VII), which is stabilized
by the agonist whatever its nature [84,85]. This structure
corresponds to an opening out of the helices on the
cytoplasmic surface, particularly helices V and VI,
creating a cavity into which the C-terminus of G-a
protein binds. Movements on helices V to VII are

http://f1000.com/reports/b/3/19

supported by a relatively stable core bundle composed of
helices I to IV. Interestingly, comparison of the crystal
structures of ligand-free opsin [86] and constitutively
active rhodopsin that retains retinal [87] reveals a
common active GPCR structure, ruling out an induced-
fit activation mechanism. Further understanding of these
specific agonist-stabilized conformational changes in
GPCRs may help to establish a structural basis for the
design of functionally selective ligands. In any case, the
data are strikingly consistent with a universal conforma-
tional selection scheme.

(d) Different ligands may activate different pathways in
b-adrenergic receptors
b-adrenergic receptors classically mediate responses to
the endogenous ligands adrenaline and noradrenaline
by coupling to Gsa and stimulating cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) production. Yet, drugs
designed as b-adrenergic receptor agonists or antagonists
can activate alternative cell signaling pathways, thereby
resulting in a multitude of signaling outputs [67,88]. For
example, b3-adrenergic receptor-stimulated activation
of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is
mediated by a cAMP–protein kinase A pathway in
adipocytes, whereas in CHO-K1 cells expressing the
b3-adrenergic receptor, increasing levels of cAMP cause
inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation [89]. Such
differential capacity for pathway activation of different
ligands has been referred to as “biased agonism/
antagonism” or “ligand-directed signaling”. These terms
refer to responses where drug A has higher efficacy than
drug B for one signaling pathway, but a lower efficacy
than drug B for a second pathway, thus with the potential
to influence pharmacological activity and clinical effi-
cacy. The observation that ligands A and B have the
capacity to elicit distinct active conformations of the
same receptor might, at first glance, be interpreted in
terms of an induced-fit mechanism, yet the spontaneous
occurrence of multiple conformations, which in turn
display altered coupling efficiency to different effectors,
should equally be considered.

Lac repressor and nuclear receptors
The lac repressor is a well-studied bacterial protein that
forms, together with the specific DNA element of its
operator, a genetic switch of the lac operon [90,91],
which has become a model of transcription regulation by
nuclear receptors. More than 4,000 point mutations have
been introduced and characterized and have opened
many avenues,
including those leading to structural
investigations. Several structures of the lac repressor have
been solved to various resolutions with different
molecules bound to the effector site. The lac-repressor
tetramer is composed of four identical 360-amino-acid

chains. The N-terminal 60-amino-acid region contains a
helix-turn-helix motif of the operator-binding headpiece
typical for DNA-binding proteins. The core comprises
residues 62–332 and is subdivided into two topologi-
cally similar regions with the ligand-binding site between
them. Finally, preceded by a flexible loop, the C-terminal
residues 339–360 form an a-helix, which is involved in
tetramerization via the formation of a four-helix bundle
with the C-terminal part of the other monomers. The
complete tetramer can best be described as a dimer of
dimers, with a pseudosymmetric interface. Each mono-
mer binds to one inducer molecule with equal affinity,
but dimer formation is required for DNA binding. The
proposed mechanism for lac-repressor activation is the
occurrence of two conformations with different organiza-
tions of the DNA-binding domains. The conformation
stabilized by the inducer IPTG (isopropyl b-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside) shows a reduced affinity for the
operator thus triggering the genetic switch. The occurrence
of constitutively active mutations and the adequate fit of
the data using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model [92],
again, favor the conformational selection mechanism.

The recent elucidation of the X-ray crystal structure of the
eukaryotic nuclear receptor PPARg–RXRa heterodimer
[93] reveals striking analogies between the nuclear
receptor superfamily [94] and the lac repressor. Even if
the occurrence of typical allosteric modulatory sites for
coactivator peptides [93] and the reciprocity of
the
interaction between distinct DNA- and ligand-binding
domains [95] strengthen the generality of the molecular
mechanisms involved, further structural information is
urgently needed to understand the allosteric transitions
of these important transcription regulators [96].

Ribonucleotide reductases
Ribonucleotide reductases catalyze the production of
deoxynucleotides from ribonucleotides in all
living
species. It is an unusual regulatory protein that uses an
apparently unique allosteric mechanism, with ATP and
deoxynucleotides as effectors, to direct substrate specifi-
city, ensuring that the enzyme produces the appropriate
levels of the four deoxynucleotides for DNA replication
[97]. In E. coli, the enzyme is a complex of two non-
identical protein dimers, R1 and R2. R2 contains a non-
heme dinuclear iron centre that, together with molecular
oxygen, oxidizes a specific tyrosine residue of R2 to create
a stable tyrosyl radical required for the formation of a
transient thiyl radical in R1. R1 is the catalytic subunit
and also contains the allosteric sites for effector binding.
During each turnover of the enzyme, a proton-coupled
electron transfer occurs from the tyrosine of R2 over a
distance of 35 Å to the catalytically active cysteine of R1
via a complex network of specific amino-acid loops.

Crystallographic studies of the catalytic subunits from
different classes of reductases in combination with the
allosteric effectors: dTTP, dATP and dGTP and with and
without the cognate substrates GDP, CDP, ADP delineate
structural changes associated with effector binding that
determine the specificity of
the enzymes towards
reduction of the appropriate substrate. An amino acid
region referred to as “loop 2” spans the effector and
substrate-binding area and is present
in a different
distinct conformation with each effector–substrate pair.
Different conformations of the protein link the bound
effector to the substrate site and create the specificity of
the enzyme catalytic reaction. An unanswered but
fascinating question is: To what extent does the protein
spontaneously display these multiple conformations in
solution as discrete entities in the absence of the cognate
ligands or alternatively are they “induced” by the actual
binding of
their multiple ligands from a common,
unique, though highly flexible form?

Conclusion
Since the static lock-and-key concept of the early 20th
century for enzyme action and receptor drug responses,
considerable evidence has revealed that proteins show a
remarkable flexibility upon ligand binding. This view is
reinforced by the discovery that,
in addition to the
classical “competitive drug action” and design [98,99],
ligands may regulate,
the
properties of far distant sites on proteins through a
conformational change [46]. Relevant to a long historical
controversy dating back to Lamarck and Darwin, the
issue of distinctions between ligand-induced conforma-
tional change and selective stabilization of pre-existing
conformational states independent of ligand structure and
occupancy has proven to be of fundamental importance
in understanding the mechanism of signal transduction
from the viewpoints of both basic and clinical/pharma-
cological applications.

in an allosteric manner,

The recent progress in various methods of structural
determinations and elaborate computations based on
principles of molecular dynamics have clearly established
the spontaneous occurrence of discrete global fluctuations
of protein conformation and the establishment of a preset
conformational equilibrium between functional states of
the protein [100]. For oligomeric proteins in solution or
membrane-bound (hemoglobin, aspartate transcarba-
moylase, and various homo- or hetero-oligomeric recep-
tors) spontaneous changes at the quaternary level resulting
in receptor activation in the absence of ligands have been
well documented by both approaches. In several instances,
in agreement with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model,
there is direct evidence—as illustrated in Figure 2 for
bacterial
lactate dehydrogenase—for fully concerted

changes of quaternary structure, without intermediate
states and with unambiguous conservation of symmetry
[101]. For GPCRs, which have been recently found to exist
mostly as homo- or heterodimers, a similar conclusion has
been reached so that there is a common global activation
mechanism of the basic receptor unit for different GPCRs
that involves discrete movements of transmembrane
helical groups. Moreover, mutations have been found in
several different types of allosteric proteins, discussed
above; such mutations can change the conformer equili-
brium, rendering a conformer far more or far less stable
and, in the extreme case, stabilizing without ligand to give
constitutive activity.
In other words, a fully active
conformation can occur in the absence of
ligand,
definitively ruling out an induced-fit mechanism. These
observations suggest that, in the course of evolution, some
mechanisms of conformational selection have been
selected that are shared by entire groups of proteins and
that
the diversity of
regulatory ligands involved. Consistent with the Monod-
Wyman-Changeux scheme, the quaternary organization of
the proteins has been the principal target of the evolu-
tionary changes that
lead to the genesis of signal
transduction mechanisms in proteins.

these occur independently of

This commonality of mechanisms does not exclude the
possibility that, at a fine-structure level, local ligand-
dependent movements in the Å range might take place
that would be consistent with the “induced-fit” mechan-
ism [100], as initially suggested with the “non-
regulatory” enzyme E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase for
enzyme activation [102]. This might also be the case, for
instance, with the reordering of the C-loop of nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor following nicotinic ligand binding
noted above [103] or for ionotropic glutamate receptors,
where changes in degree of closure of the bilobed agonist-
binding site quantitatively control the open probability of
discrete sub-conductance states of the ion channel [104].
Yet, it should be emphasized that at the present level of
resolution,
the detailed mechanisms for such local
conformational changes have not been identified at the
atomic level and may equally be interpreted in terms of
conformational selection—within an equilibrium of
multiple (more than two) alternative structures [105]—
or of an “adequate” induced-fit mechanism.

Progress will likely result from the rapid advances in
computational power and improved algorithms, permit-
ting longer simulations for complex systems that occur
over time frames (microseconds to milliseconds) rele-
vant to the phenomena discussed here; in particular, this
could be achieved using a special purpose machine for
long molecular dynamics simulations [106] involving
protein molecules and ligands that can reveal new

allosteric targets [107]. Other advances are likely to arise
from new experimental approaches that build on the
power of TR-WAXS as described for hemoglobin [19].
These approaches are anticipated to open new opportu-
nities for pharmacology and drug design of many
neurological and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, drugs
will have to be targeted not to a single, fixed state of
ligand binding proteins but instead, more selectively, to
one of
the several conformations of such proteins.
However, it would be foolhardy to predict exactly what
the next 50 years will produce.

In conclusion, in answer to the question: “conforma-
tional selection or induced-fit?”, the response is that

following 50 years of debate and experimentations, the
vast majority of the data support the conformational
selection (Monod-Wyman-Changeux) scheme of signal
transduction.
