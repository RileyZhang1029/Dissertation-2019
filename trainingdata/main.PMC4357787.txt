To derive the details of the protein peptide interaction mechanism is often a cumbersome task, though it can be made easier with the availability of speciﬁc databases and tools.
The Peptide Binding Protein Database (Pep- Bind) is a curated and searchable repository of the structures, sequences and experimental observa- tions of 3100 protein peptide complexes.
The web interface contains a computational tool, protein inter-chain interaction (PICI), for computing several types of weak or strong interactions at the pro- tein peptide interaction interface and visualizing the identiﬁed interactions between residues in Jmol viewer.
This initial database release focuses on providing protein peptide interface informa- tion along with structure and sequence information for protein peptide complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
Structures in PepBind are classiﬁed based on their cellular activity.
More than 40% of the structures in the database are found to be involved in different regulatory pathways and nearly 20% in the immune system.
These data indicate the importance of protein  peptide complexes in the regulation of cellular processes.
PepBind is freely accessible at http:// pepbind.bicpu.edu.in/.

Production and hosting by Elsevier  Introduction  Functional analyses of proteins involve the exploration of their interactions with other molecules, which plays vital roles in dif- ferent pathways.
Nearly 60% of the interaction pathways such as signal transduction, apoptotic, immune system and other pathways contain domains with bound peptides [1].
These inter- actions are prevalent in Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), antibodies, proteases, cal- modulin, PapD chaperone and OppA (oligopeptide permease  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

Protein peptide interactions require only a small interface and can occur in many interaction networks.
Hence, these are attractive drug targets both for small molecules and inhibitory peptides [3 5].
This implies that synthetic peptides can be designed to alter speciﬁc interactions in disease or other pathways [1,6,7].
Out of the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [8], every month around 20 new entries are shown to exhibit interactions with small peptides.
As the num- ber of new and interesting protein peptide complex structures continue to expand, our understanding of these protein peptide recognition events should improve.
To understand and analyze the protein peptide interaction mechanisms, a reliable database of protein peptide complexes is necessary.
A number of se- quence-based protein peptide interaction databases are avail- able, such as ELM [9], PhosphoELM [10], DOMINO [11], SCANSITE [12], PepBank [13], APD [14], ASPD [15] and BIO- PEP [16].
Structural data are also available on protein peptide complex structures in peptiDB [17] and PepX [18].
While pep- tiDB is a set of 103 curated PDB ﬁles for non-redundant protein peptide complexes, PepX contains 1431 non-redundant X-ray structures clustered based on their binding interfaces and backbone variations.
Previous studies report heterogeneity of domains or proteins to bind multiple peptides (e.g., at least 13 different types of peptides have been reported to bind to SH3 do- mains [19]).
For detailed analysis of interactions of similar pro- teins with different peptides, an enormous amount of data concerning protein peptide complex structures are needed.
To address this problem, we have created the Peptide Binding Pro- tein Database (PepBind), which contains 3100 available protein  structures from the PDB, irrespective of the structure determi- nation methods and similarity in their protein backbone.
Different kinds of interactions have been noted in the stabil- ization of protein peptide binding.
Analyses of various interact- ing interfaces between linear peptide and protein domains help us in distinguishing transient and permanent complexes [20  22].
It has been demonstrated that protein-peptide interfaces contain more hydrogen bonds per 100 A  2 solvent accessible sur- face area (ASA) (i.e., 50% more than protein protein interac- tions and 100% more than intrinsically-unstructured regions to protein interactions) [17].
The importance of other interac- tions such as interactions between nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid residues and ionic interactions in the structure and function of proteins is also well known [23,24].
Knowing the importance of protein peptide interface hydrogen bonds and other kinds of interactions, we developed and integrated a web-based interac- tion tool, protein inter-chain interaction (PICI), which calcu- lates all the interface hydrogen bonds along with other interactions (such as disulﬁde bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic interactions) in tertiary structures of protein peptide complexes and can be visualized with an integrated Jmol [25] viewer.
Although a similar tool, Protein Interaction Calculator (PIC) [26], has been available, this tool calculates interface inter- actions speciﬁc for the peptide chain of a protein peptide com- plex structure and visualizes them in a single web page along with highlighted interacting residues on sequences.
We have also developed a binding prediction server built in PepBind (http:// pepbind.bicpu.edu.in/PepBind_prediction_beta.php) to predict the possible protein domains in the PepBind database that may bind the user-deﬁned peptide sequence.
Interactions between the complex of Apopain with the tetrapeptide inhibitor ACE-DVA-ASK (PDB ID: 1CP3)  Figure 1 Hydrogen bonds (A), hydrophobic interaction (B) and ionic interactions (C) were identiﬁed by PICI server.
Interacting residues are colored in brown.
Das AA et al / PepBind: Protein peptide Database with PICI Tool  243  Results  while 10.5% structures in the database are associated with pro- teins involved in other cellular activities.
The PepBind database provides researchers with residue and atomic-level information about sequences and structures of protein peptide complexes and their interfaces, helping in the analysis of protein peptide interactions by computing various interface interactions and by providing structural information both interactively on screen and in a text format (Figure 1).
The PepBind database also maintains a repository of structure coordinate ﬁles, PDBML [27] data ﬁles and protein peptide interaction ﬁles generated by PICI tool.
The database is up- dated on a regular basis to serve as a resource for structural, functional and protein peptide interaction studies of peptide- binding proteins.
Researchers can also submit protein peptide complexes to the database, which will be uploaded to PepBind after manual veriﬁcation.
Database statistics  As shown in Table 1, current version of PepBind contains structural information for a total of 3100 protein peptide com- plexes.
Based on cellular activity, 1745 complexes of all the 3100 proteins (56.3%) are involved in regulatory pathways, along with inhibitory complexes.
Our study shows 1278 struc- tures (41.2%) in the database play major roles in hormonal activity, gene regulation, transcription and signal transduction pathways along with transferases.
Furthermore, 600 structures (19.3%) in the database are found to function in the immune system.
It has been found that 252 proteins (8.1%) are struc- tural, contractile and membrane proteins involved mainly in transport (5.2%) and cell adhesion (1.9%).
In addition, 953 (30.7%) structures have protease or other hydrolase activities,  Web interface  The user interface has been developed for browsing through all the contents of the database as a list or by different categories (Figure 2).
For the ease of users to search and access data, we have integrated many search tools (Figure 2A) into the web interface.
Using the  simple search  function, users can retrieve information about protein peptide complexes using their PDB ID or protein name.
Our  keyword search  tool scans all the ﬁelds of all the tables in PepBind for the matched word and re- turns a list of all protein structures related to the query.
Using the  advanced search  function, users can ﬁlter search based on peptide length, cellular activity of proteins, structure determi- nation methods (e.g., X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic res- onance and electron microscopy) and authors contributing to solving protein structure.
All these search options with their parameters are joined by  AND  operator for an intensive search.
Additionally, to ﬁnd any protein sequences homolo- gous to the sequence submitted, we provide BLAST searching [28] against PepBind/PDB/SwissProt.
The web interface for the output result has been designed to show all the chains present in the protein structure (Figure 2B).
Each chain is linked to the PICI web tool for analyzing its interactions with other chains of the protein.
This tool shows the interaction details by highlighting the corresponding inter- acting residues in the displayed sequence along with the Jmol visualization tool for the identiﬁed interactions between the residues (Figure 2C).
Different tab viewers have been designed for various types of interactions.

For a structure similarity search, we take advantage of the web ser- vice of PDB, which employs the FATCAT algorithm [31] to recognize homologous domains available at PepBind, SCOP [32] and PDP [33].
Discussion  Protein peptide interactions are the key components of cellu- lar processes such as signal transduction, protein trafﬁcking, defense mechanisms and enzyme regulation.
Various databases are available on protein interactions.
They can be grouped as protein-small molecule, protein-nucleic acid and protein   protein interaction databases.
However, the retrieval of struc- tural and functional information of protein peptide interac- tions in biological processes is tedious due to the lack of speciﬁc databases to provide such details.
The establishment of the PepX database has resolved the difﬁculty of unavailabil- ity of a protein peptide interaction database, whereby authors have classiﬁed the proteins based on backbone variations and binding interfaces.
While in PepX, grouping is based solely on 3D similarity, PepBind complements PepX by providing inter- face information for both the peptide and protein chains of the complexes along with their cellular functions and options for sequence and structure similarity searches.
PepBind is inte- grated with the Jmol viewer to visualize the interface residues along with the interaction ﬁles generated by the PICI tool.
Furthermore, PepBind provides BLAST search and structure similarity search for protein chains.
It also provides a predic- tion service for binding of user-given peptides to possible pro- tein domains present in the PepBind database.
Links to other related databases and servers for the queried protein are provided for further analysis of the structures.
These resources include PDB [8], PDBsum [34], Pfam [35],   Das AA et al / PepBind: Protein peptide Database with PICI Tool  245  CASTp [36], OCA Browser (http://bip.weizmann.ac.il/oca/), PSI/KB (http://sbkb.org/kb/), SRS [37], MMDB [38], PQS [39], SCOP [32], CATH [40], Proteopedia [41], Jena Library [42] and UniProt [43].
Currently our interaction tool PICI is capable of analyzing inter-chain interactions like hydrogen bond, disulﬁde bridge, hydrophobic interaction and ionic interaction.
Keeping in view the importance of other weak interactions in stabilizing the protein structure, we plan to improve our tool to study inter- actions such as aromatic-aromatic interactions [44], cation-pi interactions [45] and aromatic-sulfur interactions [46].
In addi- tion, the current interaction tool capabilities will be extended to user-submitted structures, allowing for examination of interfaces in complexes currently not present in the PepBind.
Methods  Data collection and curation  in the PDB.
Because PepBind intends  Files for atomic coordinate (pdb ﬁles   version 3.30), sequences (fasta ﬁles) and other data (pdbml ﬁles   version 4.0) of 3100 protein peptide complexes in the PDB were downloaded fol- lowing a thorough manual screening of all the available struc- tures to be a comprehensive collection of protein peptide complexes from the PDB, the database contains all the available protein pep- tide complexes, irrespective of their sequence or structure redundancy.
Classiﬁcation of all the collected structure data was done in three steps: (I) an automated program to scan the amino acid sequences and classify them based on length of the bound peptide, (II) manual curation for the cellular activity of the complexes through study of the literature and (III) an automated program to read the data ﬁle and group the complexes as per their structure determination methods.
Functionality has been analyzed through literature studies and classiﬁed as proteins involved in different cellular activities and grouped in 19 categories.
Database schema and implementation  The PepBind database consists of a series of server-side scripts written in the PHP programming language with HTML and JavaScript for user interface functions, which runs on the Apache 2.2 web server, using MySQL 5.1 as a database back-end.
Atomic coordinate information from the PDB and other related information from other remote databases and web servers were mined through an automated program and stored in a ﬁle repository for further processing.
We developed sets of PHP scripts for operating with the available data and process them for easy integration in the database and front- end user interface.
The ﬁrst set of scripts reads the PDBML ﬁles [27], extracts the data, and inserts them into the database tables  the second set sorts these data with respect to each attri- bute and the third set generates web pages with speciﬁc infor- mation about individual complexes.
was developed and integrated into PepBind.
This tool parses the structure coordinate ﬁles, removes the hetero atoms and water molecules, and predicts the interaction based on coordi- nate distance between atoms of amino acid residues of small peptide and the protein.
For structures determined by NMR, the ﬁrst model in the ﬁle is taken for calculation by PICI tool.
For the two atoms A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2), linear distance D is calculated as per the Euclidean distance equation D(A, B) =   (x1   x2)2 + (y1   y2)2 + (z1   z2)2 .
p  Various potential interactions are calculated based on stan- dard and published criteria.
The hydrogen bond is detected if the distance between oxygen or nitrogen atoms of the peptide and the protein domain is 63.5 A  [47].
Interactions between hydrophobic residues (such as alanine, valine, leucine, isoleu- cine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, proline and tyro- sine) [48] have been predicted if they fall within 5 A  range.
Apart from these interactions, ionic residue (arginine, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid) pairs falling within 6 A  contribute to ionic interactions.
The tool with integrated Jmol viewer shows various interactions between the peptide and the amino acid residues of the interacting protein chains.
Moreover, it highlights the positions of interacting amino acid residues on the displayed sequence (Figure 2D).
This tool also generates an interaction ﬁle for each type of interactions.
A sequence modiﬁcation tool has been developed and incorporated into the result page, which can read the protein sequence ﬁle and color the amino acid sequence (using single letter code) of protein according to their biochemical proper- ties (such as green for non-polar hydrophobic amino acids, yel- low for uncharged polar amino acids, blue for positively charged amino acids, red for negatively charged amino acids and black for non standard amino acids).
A web-based predic- tion server has been provided to ﬁnd the protein domains pres- ent in the database that likely bind to the user-given peptide.
The sequence search tool present in the web interface allows users to BLAST search the queried sequence in the database using various parameters.
All data related to structure, sequence and interface interac- tions currently in the PepBind database have been made avail- able for further analysis.
These ﬁles along with the complete list of the PepBind dataset can be downloaded freely from our database.
A reporting tool has been integrated to generate the result in a printer-friendly PDF ﬁle.
