Abstract
Bacterial persistence is of major concern as persistent bacterial infections involving bacteria such as
Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pose significant
public health problems worldwide. This report discusses the recent advances in understanding the
strategies used by bacteria during persistent infection that allow them to colonize specific sites in the
host and evade immune surveillance.

Long-term bacterial infections pose several fundamental
biological questions: How metabolically active are
bacteria during a persistent infection? Are they dividing,
or in a state of quiescence? And how do these bacteria
evade the immune system for so long?

Acute infections by pathogenic bacteria cause a dramatic
activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses.
If the pathogen survives initial contact with the host’s
innate immune system (and the host is not killed), the
infection is usually cleared by the host’s adaptive
immune system. However, some bacterial pathogens
maintain infections for the lifetime of their mammalian
hosts, even in the presence of a robust immune response.

Most of what we’ve learned about persistent infections
comes from the study of several well-known illnesses. For
example, Helicobacter pylori, the cause of most stomach
ulcers, inhabits the stomach lining, where its persistence
can be lifelong; Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to
establish long-term infections that can manifest as acute
or chronic versions of the lung disease, or be clinically
asymptomatic yet retain the potential to reactivate; and
Salmonella enterica, specifically the serotype Typhi, causes
typhoid fever, a systemic infection that involves coloniza-
tion of the reticuloendothelial system—the network of
immune cells residing in some connective tissue. Some

infected individuals become lifelong carriers, periodically
shedding large numbers of bacteria in their stools. These
persistently infected carriers serve as a reservoir for the
pathogens, and are essential for survival of the bacteria
within a restricted host population. In humans, infection
with another serotype, Typhimurium, is normally asso-
ciated with self-limiting gastroenteritis, and systemic
disease is rare in most parts of the world.

However, a highly invasive form of nontyphoidal
Salmonella (NTS) has become a major public health
problem in parts of Africa. Although NTS strains do not
normally persist in immunocompetent humans, there is
serious concern about the potential that these strains
might acquire that ability as they become more “human-
adapted [1].

”

We are only now beginning to understand the bacterial
and host factors involved in the host–pathogen interaction
during persistent infection, and these new discoveries are
likely to provide new and exciting directions for research in
the fields of microbial pathogenesis and immunology.

Making a better replicative niche
H. pylori is uniquely adapted to colonize the hostile
environment of the human stomach. More virulent strains
of H. pylori inject virulence factors into gastric epithelial

cells, a step that is associated with the development of
stomach cancer. These factors provide an advantage to the
invading bacterium because they disrupt epithelial cell
polarity. This allows bacteria to attach and grow on the
apical surface of epithelial cells, where it may be easier for
them to acquire the nutrients necessary for survival [2].

Salmonella has developed its own mechanisms for coloniz-
ing a host and replicating despite the presence of immune
cells. Most of the information on Salmonella immune-
evasion mechanisms has come from a mouse model of
persistent Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Salmonella
Typhimurium colonizes the mesenteric lymph nodes of
these mice—a gathering place for immune cells—and is
occasionally found in the gallbladder, liver, and spleen.
One mechanism that
uses to subvert the
immune system is to secrete the protein SseI into dendritic
cells, which normally play a role in activating immunity.
The bacterial protein interferes with the migration of
infected cells to lymphoid tissues by specifically binding to
the cell-migration regulator IQGAP. This prevents normal
dendritic-cell migration, limiting presentation of Salmo-
nella antigens and naive T-cell priming, and thereby
inhibiting adaptive immunity [3,4].

Salmonella

Subverting the host
Analyzing the role of host immune factors in chronic
Salmonella infection has shed light on the mechanisms
that allow for persistent bacterial growth. For example,
regulatory T cells, which control the balance between
immune-cell activation and suppression, can dictate the
course of persistent Salmonella infection by suppressing
the adaptive immune response. Leukocytes can also play
a role in tuberculosis, where progression from a latent,
subclinical infection to active disease is controlled by
foamy macrophages within a granuloma (a spherical
mass of immune cells that forms around a pathogen that
can’t be cleared). The foamy macrophage appears to be a
key participant in both sustaining bacteria and con-
tributing to the tissue pathology that leads to the release
of infectious bacilli. The normally beneficial macro-
phages become pathologic in this situation through
pathogen-initiated dysregulation of lipid synthesis [5].

Studying mechanisms of bacterial persistence is made
more complex by the presence of native (nonpathogenic)
organisms, particularly in the human gut. The human gut
microflora is important in regulating host inflammatory
responses and preventing inappropriate (anti-self)
immune responses. Interactions between gut microbiota
and the immune system are under intense study because
of their potential effects on persistent infections and,
therefore, on the health of an individual. Recent studies
have delved further into our understanding of this

relationship by identifying host-specific bacteria respon-
sible for directly modulating the gut immune response
towards Salmonella [6,7]. Further studies are now needed
to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the
establishment of persistent systemic infections.
