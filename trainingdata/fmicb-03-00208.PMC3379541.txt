Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) have recently been recognized as a signiﬁcant compo-
nent of many microbial communities and represent one of the most abundant prokaryotic
groups in the biosphere. However, only few AOA have been successfully cultivated so
far and information on the physiology and genomic content remains scarce. We have per-
formed a metagenomic analysis to extend the knowledge of the AOA afﬁliated with group
I.1b that is widespread in terrestrial habitats and of which no genome sequences has
been described yet. A fosmid library was generated from samples of a radioactive ther-
mal cave (46˚C) in the Austrian Central Alps in which AOA had been found as a major
part of the microbial community. Out of 16 fosmids that possessed either an amoA or
16S rRNA gene afﬁliating with AOA, 5 were fully sequenced, 4 of which grouped with
the soil/I.1b (Nitrososphaera-) lineage, and 1 with marine/I.1a (Nitrosopumilus-) lineage.
Phylogenetic analyses of amoBC and an associated conserved gene were congruent with
earlier analyses based on amoA and 16S rRNA genes and supported the separation of
the soil and marine group. Several putative genes that did not have homologs in currently
available marine Thaumarchaeota genomes indicated that AOA of the soil group contain
speciﬁc genes that are distinct from their marine relatives. Potential cis-regulatory elements
around conserved promoter motifs found upstream of the amo genes in sequenced (meta-)
genomes differed in marine and soil group AOA. On one fosmid, a group of genes including
amoA and amoB were ﬂanked by identical transposable insertion sequences, indicating
that amoAB could potentially be co-mobilized in the form of a composite transposon. This
might be one of the mechanisms that caused the greater variation in gene order compared
to genomes in the marine counterparts. Our ﬁndings highlight the genetic diversity within
the two major and widespread lineages of Thaumarchaeota.

INTRODUCTION
Molecular surveys of the last two decades have revealed the ubiq-
uitous distribution of an abundant group of archaea that were
initially thought to be associated with hyperthermophilic Cre-
narchaeota (DeLong, 1992; Fuhrman et al., 1992; Schleper et al.,
2005). These “mesophilic” Crenarchaeota, or Group I Crenar-
chaeota (DeLong, 1998) have more recently been assigned to a
new archaeal phylum, the Thaumarchaeota (Brochier-Armanet
et al., 2008; Spang et al., 2010). Culture-independent metagenomic
studies (Venter et al., 2004; Treusch et al., 2005) led to the iden-
tiﬁcation of genes encoding two subunits (A and B) of a putative
ammonium monooxygenase associated with these organisms. The
physical linkage of an archaeal 16S rRNA gene to the amo genes on
a genomic fragment from soil indicated that group I archaea might
indeed have the ability to oxidize ammonia to nitrite (Schleper
et al., 2005). This physiology was conﬁrmed by the cultivation of
a chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaeon, Nitrosop-
umilus maritimus, isolated from a marine aquarium in Seattle

(Könneke et al., 2005), and more recently of Nitrososphaera vien-
nensis isolated from Viennese garden soil (Tourna et al., 2011). The
enrichment cultures of Nitrososphaera gargensis from a hot spring
(Hatzenpichler et al., 2008), of Nitrosotalea devanaterra from
an acidic environment (Lehtovirta-Morley et al., 2011), and of
Nitrosopumilus koreensis from korean agricultural soil (Jung et al.,
2011) all conﬁrm growth of these Thaumarchaeota by ammonia
oxidation.

Based on a recently updated phylogenetic analyses of available
archaeal amoA genes the two earlier identiﬁed major groups of
Thaumarchaeota (group I.1a, group I.1b) have been extended to a
total of ﬁve clusters (Pester et al., 2012). The Nitrosopumilus cluster
(corresponding to the earlier group I.1a; Pester et al., 2012) is the
dominant archaeal group in world’s oceans which accounts for up
to 20% of planktonic prokaryotic cells (Fuhrman and Ouverney,
1998; Karner et al., 2001; Herndl et al., 2005). The Nitrososphaera
cluster (corresponding to group I.1b) dominate archaeal com-
munities in most soils where they typically account for 1–5% of

total 16S rRNA gene abundance (Buckley et al., 1998; Ochsenre-
iter et al., 2003; Leininger et al., 2006; Bates et al., 2011). Afﬁliated
sequences have been found in other environments including, e.g.,
hot springs, freshwater, and freshwater sediments (Hershberger
et al., 1996; Ochsenreiter et al., 2003; Weidler et al., 2007). Like-
wise Group I.1a (Nitrosopumilus cluster) has also been found in
non-marine environments including freshwater, freshwater sedi-
ments as well as soil and terrestrial hot springs (MacGregor et al.,
1997; Ochsenreiter et al., 2003; Spear et al., 2007; Weidler et al.,
2007, 2008; Ghai et al., 2011).

Although all so far cultivated Thaumarchaeota are capable of
generating energy from the oxidation of ammonia and ﬁxing
inorganic carbon, several indications for a greater physiologi-
cal potential have been found. For example, incorporation of
organic carbon compounds has been suggested based on stud-
ies in the marine realm (Ouverney and Fuhrman, 2000; Herndl
et al., 2005; Ingalls et al., 2006; Teira et al., 2006). It remains cur-
rently unclear though, if speciﬁc marine lineages are dependent on
organic carbon or if Nitrosopumilus-type organisms can switch to
mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth under certain conditions.
Different growth modes have, however, clearly been demonstrated
for organisms of the soil cluster (or I.1b group). For example,
N. viennensis grows about 10 times faster when low amounts
of organic substrates (e.g., pyruvate) are added to the medium,
although only a small percentage of carbon from pyruvate is incor-
porated into biomass (Tourna et al., 2011). Mussmann et al. (2011)
demonstrated that growing populations of certain group I.1b
organisms in a waste water treatment plant did not incorporate
any detectable inorganic carbon, indicating a purely heterotrophic
growth mode even without ammonia oxidation. In addition, Jia
and Conrad (2009) got indications for growth of group I.1b organ-
isms in an environmental study when no nitriﬁcation activity was
occurring. Thaumarchaeota that dominate in soil habitats, might
thus have greater metabolic diversity compared to organisms of
the Nitrosopumilus cluster.

The arrangement of the ammonia monooxygenase gene cluster
reveals also differences between the diverse lineages of ammonia-
oxidizing Thaumarchaeota, while all ammonia-oxidizing bacte-
ria (AOB) possess an amo operon with conserved CAB subunit
arrangement (Norton et al., 2002; Klotz and Stein, 2008). In the
marine Thaumarchaeota, e.g., N. maritimus (Walker et al., 2010)
and N. limnia (Blainey et al., 2011) amoA, B, and C genes occur
within one cluster (AxCB), but the gene arrangement in organ-
isms of the Nitrososphaera and Nitrosocaldus clusters seem more
variable, and always lack a closely associated amoC gene (Treusch
et al., 2005; de la Torre et al., 2008; Tourna et al., 2011).

While several large scale metagenomic studies (Venter et al.,
2004; DeLong et al., 2006; Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2007) and four
complete genome sequences have been made available for Thau-
marchaeota of the Nitrosopumilus cluster (group I.1a), genomic
information on archaea of the Nitrososphaera cluster (I.1b group)
are limited to a few metagenomic fragments (Quaiser et al., 2002;
Treusch et al., 2004, 2005; Bartossek et al., 2010).

Here we expand genomic insights into group I.1b organisms, by
analyzing metagenomic fragments from organisms closely related
to Nitrososphaera sp.

Samples from a thermal (46˚C) and slightly radioactive spring
in Bad Gastein (Austria) were investigated, in which a previous

survey had shown a high diversity of bacteria and the presence
of 16S rRNA gene sequences of group I.1b Thaumarchaeota,
to the exclusion of group I.1a (Weidler et al., 2007) and of
bacterial ammonia oxidizers (Weidler et al., 2008). Our study
revealed further differences separating the two major lineages of
ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) including speciﬁc gene sets
and the presence of distinct putative cis-regulatory sequences
found to be conserved in the promoter regions of amoA, B, C,
and associated genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING, CLONING OF PCR-PRODUCTS, AND SEQUENCING
Spring water, slides (incubated in the cave water for 14 days), and
bioﬁlm were sampled in early spring 2006 from Franz Josef Quelle
as described previously (Weidler et al., 2007). The cave water was
ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter before the DNA was isolated
using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, Heidel-
berg) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR-products for
amoA gene clone libraries of every sample were produced using
primers amo19F and amo643R and PCR conditions as described
earlier (Leininger et al., 2006). Subsequent cloning into pCR 4-
TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and sequencing
of transformants was performed as described earlier (Bartossek
et al., 2010).

PREPARATION OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT DNA FROM CAVE
MATERIAL AND LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION
For the construction of a fosmid library with high molecular
weight DNA, bioﬁlm, and 70 L of water were collected under
sterile conditions (Weidler et al., 2007). The water was ﬁltered
through a 0.22 μm pore size ﬁlter and ﬁlter and bioﬁlm were
stored at 4˚C until further processing. For isolation of puriﬁed
high molecular weight DNA we used a modiﬁed protocol from
Zhou et al. (1996) using a CTAB buffer as previously described
(Quaiser et al., 2003) with some further optimization (Reigstad
et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, the cells were washed off the ﬁlter with DNA
extraction buffer (Zhou et al., 1996) and pooled with the bioﬁlm
to increase the amount of biomass. For lysis, lysozyme (1 mg/mL
ﬁnal concentration) was added and the solution was incubated
for 1 h at 37˚C. Subsequently a second lysis step with proteinase
K (250 μg/mL ﬁnal concentration) was performed at 40˚C for
1 h. SDS was added to a concentration of 1.4% and the mix-
ture was incubated at 65˚C for 2 h with inversion every 15 min.
The DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipi-
tated with 2-propanol. Puriﬁcation of the DNA was performed
using a pulsed-ﬁeld electrophoresis procedure as described earlier
(Quaiser et al., 2002) that involved the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone
to remove residual polyphenolic compounds such as humic and
fulvic acids.

The library was constructed by ligation of the DNA into the
fosmid vector pEpiFOS-5 (Epicentre) as described earlier (Quaiser
et al., 2002). Around 40,000 clones were obtained for the library
Josef01 and 29.874 clones were arrayed in microtiter plates.

SCREENING FOR GENOMIC FRAGMENTS OF THAUMARCHAEOTA
The fosmid library was screened for the presence of archaeal
amoA and 16S rRNA genes by PCR using the primers amo19F
and amo643R (Leininger et al., 2006) and 20F and 958R (DeLong,

1992), respectively. The screening was performed as described ear-
lier (Bartossek et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, DNA pools of every 384-well
plate were screened for the presence of either amoA or 16S rRNA
genes. 16S rRNA PCR-products of the correct size (950 bp) were
obtained from pools 01, 02, 05, 17, and 19. amoA PCR-products
of the correct size (647 bp) were obtained from the pools 10, 13,
16, 17, 19, 22, and 24. To identify the positive clone in the plate,
the positive 384-well plates were replicated in further microtiter
plates and the cells of each column were pooled (24 pools per
plate) and lysed by heat. One microliter of the supernatant was
used for PCR. To identify the ﬁnal coordinate 1 μL of the crude
cell extract (without lysis) was used in the subsequent PCR.

SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
Five fosmids in total were sequenced using either Sanger or 454
sequencing, with fosmid 10c16 sequenced using both approaches.
Additionally, Sanger end-sequences of the fosmids and the 16S
rRNA gene sequences were needed to be able to assemble the
fosmids received in the 454 approach.

Fosmids 10c16, 19c08, and 22i07 were sequenced by prepar-
ing individual subclone libraries. Fosmid DNA was fragmented
by mechanical shearing and 2–3 kb fragments were cloned into
pDrive vector (Qiagen). The ends of the cloned DNA fragments
were sequenced with vector primers SP6 and M13R using an
ABI PRISM 377 capillary sequencer (ABI). Remaining sequence
gaps were closed by primer walking with sequence-derived
oligonucleotides and the resulting reads assembled using the
PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED package (Ewing et al., 1998; Gordon
et al., 1998).

A pyrosequencing shotgun approach was used for sequenc-
ing fosmids 02j05, 05d18, and 10c16. DNA from each fosmid
was pooled (125 ng each) with DNA derived from 37 other fos-
mids (derived from a separate study), and sequenced using a GS
20 sequencer (Roche Applied Sciences/454 Life Sciences, Bran-
ford, CT, USA). Additionally, end-sequencing of EpiFos fosmids
was performed using vector-primer T7, pEF FP, and pEF RP as
recommended by the manufacturer (Epicentre). 16S rRNA gene
sequencing was performed using primers 20F and 958R (DeLong,
1992). Sequencing reactions and cycling conditions were per-
formed as described previously1. Brieﬂy, 6 μL of fosmid DNA,
2 μL of BigDye Terminator 3.1, 1 μL of ABI 5× sequencing
buffer and 10 pmole primer were mixed and ampliﬁed using the
following thermocycling procedure: 5 min of 95˚C, followed by
100 cycles of 95˚C for 30 s 50˚C for 10 s and 60˚C for 4 min.
Sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 377 capillary
sequencer (ABI).

Pyrosequencing data and additional Sanger reads from fos-
mids 02j05, 05d18, and 10c16 were assembled using Newbler (454
Life Sciences) and the resulting contigs were edited using Consed
(Gordon et al., 1998) using sub-assemblies and ensuring that only
Sanger reads associated with the correct fosmid were included
in each assembly. The resulting contig assemblies were examined
further for quality control by manual inspection and veriﬁcation
using the program HawkEye (Schatz et al., 2007).

SEQUENCE ANNOTATION
Protein coding sequences were identiﬁed using Glimmer v3
(Delcher et al., 2007), blastx searches of public protein databases
(GenBank nr and env_nr), the IMG/M metagenome analysis sys-
tem (Markowitz et al., 2008) and the pedant software system2.
Annotations were manually curated as described earlier (Bar-
tossek et al., 2010). IS elements were additionally screened for
by IS_ﬁnder3.

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA and amo gene sequences was
performed using PHyML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) for max-
imum likelihood analysis and MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007)
for distance analysis. After alignment and using unambiguously
aligned positions only, all trees were constructed using ML-
estimated gamma-distributed, variable sites, and GTR or Tamura
3-parameter correction for ML and distance analyses, respectively.
Bootstrap support was calculated using 100 replicates for ML
analyses and 1000 replicates for distance analysis.

Identities of amoABC“X” genes were calculated with the
EMBOSS pairwise alignment tool after removing unalignable
regions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
SAMPLING AND CONSTRUCTION OF A METAGENOMIC FOSMID
LIBRARY
Samples were taken from the “Franz Josef Quelle,” a thermal
spring located near Bad Gastein, Salzburg, Austria. Spring water
(46˚C, pH 8) and surrounding bioﬁlm material were sampled,
together with material grown in situ on glass slides which have
been incubated several weeks to enable microbial colonization
from the spring water. An initial analysis of the three differ-
ent sample types was performed to determine whether there
were differences in the archaeal community structures. DNA was
extracted and after PCR of amoA genes, small clone libraries
were constructed and 28 clones sequenced. The phylogenetic tree
(Figure 1) shows that the amoA sequences from PCR-products
of all sample types formed three clusters, two belonged to group
I.1b amoA, and one to group I.1a. Since no differences in the
population structure were observed among the samples, biomass
from all samples was pooled to obtain as much initial chromoso-
mal DNA as possible for the construction of a fosmid library.
High molecular weight (hmw) DNA was extracted using the
method based on Zhou et al. (1996) after some optimizations
(Reigstad et al., 2011). A fosmid library with 29,874 clones was
produced and archived. The average insert size was approximately
40 kb as determined by restriction analysis and pulse ﬁeld gel
electrophoresis.

ISOLATION OF ARCHAEAL amoA AND 16S rRNA GENES FROM THE
METAGENOMIC LIBRARY
Twenty-ﬁve microtiter plates (9575 clones) were screened by PCR
for the presence of archaeal 16S rRNA and ammonia monooxy-
genase subunit A (amoA) genes. Six fosmids were positive for 16S

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF 16S rRNA AND amoA GENE SEQUENCES
FROM THAUMARCHAEAL FOSMID CLONES
Phylogenetic analysis of six 16S rRNA gene sequences associ-
ated with fosmids 01b24, 02j05, 02g06, 05d18, 17e16, and 19k20
was performed with reference sequences including 16S rRNA
sequences from environmental thaumarchaeal clones and from
six representatives in pure or enrichment culture: N. maritimus,
N. limnia, C. symbiosum, N. yellowstonii, N. viennensis, and N.
gargensis (Figure 2). Five fosmid sequences were afﬁliated with
group I.1b (“soil group”) and were placed within a lineage dom-
inated by sequences from subsurface or thermophilic environ-
ments. Together, they formed a monophyletic group (with all
sequences sharing ≥97% identity) with 16S rRNA gene sequences
from the same habitat (Franz Josef spring – FJQ sequences in
Figure 2; Weidler et al., 2007), the moderate thermophile N.
gargensis (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008), soil archaeon N. vien-
nensis (Tourna et al., 2011), sequence SAGMA-2 from a South
African Gold mine (Takai et al., 2001), and Gitt-GR sequences

recovered from a uranium mining waste in Germany (Selenska-
Pobell et al., unpublished). The close relationship to the lat-
ter sequences is interesting as, like the Franz Josef Spring, the
source of “Gitt” samples contain low amounts of radioactivity
(radium, radon, and uranium; Heinen and Lauwers, 1988). Fos-
mid 19k20 was placed within the “marine” group I.1a. Organ-
isms from this lineage have not been identiﬁed in previous
studies of the archaeal communities in the Franz Josef spring
(Weidler et al., 2007). This sequence showed high similarity
to SAGMA-8 (99%) and HAuD-MA13 (97%), both of which
were also recovered from subsurface environments in South
Africa and Japan, respectively (Takai et al., 2001; Nunoura et al.,
2005).

Phylogenetic analysis of the amoA gene sequences associ-
ated with 10 fosmids (10c16, 13g04, 16a14, 17g13, 19c08, 22b01,
22i07, 22p11, 24e20, 24j20) and cloned amoA PCR-products
showed a similar phylogenetic distribution like 16S rRNA genes
(Figure 1). Again, the majority of the fosmids afﬁliated with
the soil (“Nitrososphaera”-) group showed high similarity to
sequences of N. viennensis and N. gargensis (8 out of 10).
Two of the 10 fosmids possessed amoA gene sequences which

C. symbiosum and N. maritimus.

or crenarchaeotes and a higher amount of hypothetical proteins
(Table 1).

The soil lineage amoA gene sequences could be placed within
one of two distinct clusters, and despite their relatively disparate
phylogenetic distribution (sequence similarity ranging between
83 and 100% on aa level), all sequences showed highest similar-
ity to sequences from other thermo-, terrestrial, or subsurface
habitats including a hot spring microbial mat in China (Jiang
et al., 2010), a geothermal mine adit in Colorado (Spear et al.,
2007), or hot springs from Iceland and Kamchatka (Reigstad et al.,
2008). The same was found for the marine group. The major-
ity of sequences clustered together, with one sequence separated
from the cluster, and again all sequences showed highest similarity
to those previously described from the same location (Weidler
et al., 2007) or to sequences from before mentioned thermal
habitats. This indicates that although these organisms are within
widely distributed groups associated with soil and marine habi-
tats, they are speciﬁcally afﬁliated with organisms from thermal
environments.

IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF GENOMIC FRAGMENTS
FROM THAUMARCHAEOTA
The amoA-containing fosmids 10c16, 19c08, and 22i07 were
selected for full sequencing in order to best cover the assumed
diversity based on the phylogenetic studies. Similarly, from six
possible 16S rRNA gene containing fosmids, one from each clus-
ter in the I.1b group (02j05 and 05d18) was selected. General
information on the fosmid sequences is given in Table 1 and
Figure 3.
The four fosmids associated with the Nitrososphaera lineage or
the soil group had a G+ C content greater than 49.9% (Table 1),
while fosmid 22i07 of the marine group had a lower G+ C content
of 42.8%. The latter fosmid had remarkably high synteny with the
genome of N. maritimus sharing gene order in 36 out of 50 ORFs
(Figure 3B). It also contained the highest number of ORFs with
homologs in known Thaumarchaeota and metagenomic thau-
marchaeal sequences (45 of 50), many of which were exclusively
found in this archaeal lineage (16 out of 50). In comparison, fos-
mids 02j05, 05d18, 10c16, and 19c08 showed a higher number of
proteins with most similar orthologs in bacteria, euryarchaeotes,

In line with this ﬁnding, only 12–37% of the ORFs encoded
on the four group I.1b fosmids had a best blastP hit with marine
Thaumarchaeota like N. maritimus, N. limnia, C. symbiosum, N.
koreensis, and marine metagenomic sequences, while 90% of the
ORFs on fosmid 22i07 had a best blastP hit with marine Thaumar-
chaeota (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). A syntenic region
spanning 12 genes was present between fosmid 02j05 and 05d18
in the region containing the 16S rRNA gene sequence (Figure 3A).
No synteny could be detected between the fosmids containing the
amo gene cluster in this survey.

A total of 90 protein encoding genes were exclusively found
in Thaumarchaeota but absent from other archaeal genomes (e-
value ≤10
−5, analysis included the draft genomes of N. vien-
nensis and N. gargensis, data not shown), most of which had
no assigned function. Eight of these ORFs belonged to the amo
gene cluster. Several genes with homology in other archaea or
bacteria may be directly or indirectly involved in carbon metab-
olism. For example aconitate hydratase encoded by ORF 16
on fosmid 22i07 and a putative fumarase encoded by ORF 1
on fosmid 5d18 are enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle. Furthermore, a homolog of a bifunctional glucose-6-
phosphase/mannose-6-phosphase isomerase (Hansen et al., 2004)
is present on fosmid 10c16 (ORF 42) which is involved in the con-
version of fructose-6-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate in the last
step of gluconeogenesis.

As in other Thaumarchaeota genomes, genes for proteins
involved in two different potential systems for cell-division were
identiﬁed on the fosmids: Firstly, FtsZ a GTPase and major player
in cell-division in most bacteria and euryarchaeotes and secondly
a homolog of ESCRT-III like proteins, that have been shown to
be involved in cell-division in Crenarchaeota (Samson and Bell,
2011) and N. maritimus (Pelve et al., 2011; ORFs 17 and 13
on fosmids 02j05 and 10c16, respectively). Further genes identi-
ﬁed encoded several ribosomal proteins, tRNA synthetases, genes
involved in regulation of transcription, uvrABC homologs, genes
encoding proteins potentially involved in sugar conversion, cofac-
tor biosynthesis and ion transport (Table S1 in Supplementary
Material).

Fosmid 10c16 contained a cluster of six genes (ORF 41, 42, 43,
44, 46, 47) with some similarity to genes involved in monosac-
charide metabolism. Some of these are related to the rmlADBC

or rfbADCB operons (according to Salmonella or Streptococ-
cus annotation, respectively) responsible for the conversion of
glucose-1-phosphate to dTDP-l-rhamnose which is an important

precursor for exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis in bacteria
(Samuel and Reeves, 2003). Homologous of these genes are also
found in other archaea. ORF 41 shows remote similarity to galE
that encodes a potential uridine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose-4-
epimerase involved in the reversible conversion of UDP-galactose
to UDP-glucose. Interestingly, this enzymatic step is important for
the biosynthesis of EPS in bacteria (Niou et al., 2009).

The presence of co-encoding rmlA-D and galE genes might
suggest the ability to synthesize exopolysaccharides, which are
important in bioﬁlm formation. Rhamnose has been reported as a
cell wall polymer in only a few archaea, such as the methanogenic
Methanobacterium formicicum and M. ruminantium (Kandler and
Konig, 1978) and one halophilic archaeon, Haloferax volcanii
(Kuntz et al., 1997). Homologs of rmlA-D are present in M.
ruminantium (Leahy et al., 2010) and H. volcanii. However, a con-
nection between those genes and the rhamnose occurrence in the
cell has not yet been demonstrated.

ﬁx ABCX GENE CLUSTER ON FOSMID 02j05
A cluster of three genes (ORF 8–10) with high similarity to
the ﬁxABCX operon found on thaumarchaeal soil fosmid 29i4
(Quaiser et al., 2002) and in N. viennensis and N. gargensis (A.
Spang and C. Schleper unpublished data) has been identiﬁed on
fosmid 02j05. Homologs occur as well in halobacteria and Sul-
folobales, and in various bacteria. FixAB and ﬁxCX genes code for
electron transferring ﬂavoproteins (Etf) and Etf-quinone reduc-
tase, respectively, that might be involved in the transfer of electrons
to nitrogenase in some diazotrophic bacteria (Arigoni et al., 1991;
Tsai and Saier, 1995; Weidenhaupt et al., 1996). No homologs could
be found in marine Thaumarchaeota or on metagenomic frag-
ments. Since homologs of ﬁxABCX are found in archaea such as
Sulfolobus solfataricus and Thermoplasma acidophilum for which
nitrogen ﬁxation has not been demonstrated, functional studies
are required to determine the physiological role of these putative
electron transfer proteins.

uvr ABC GENE CLUSTER ON FOSMID 02j05
Fosmid 02j05 contains uvrABC genes (ORFs 04 through 06)
coding for a potential UvrABC excinuclease, an enzyme com-
plex mediating DNA excision repair (Selby and Sancar, 1990).
Homologs were found in all published thaumarchaeal genomes
(with the exception of N. limnia which possesses only a partial
cluster (uvrAB) at the end of an incomplete genomic contig).
Additionally, UvrABC homologs can be found in halophilic and
methanogenic Euryarchaeota and bacteria, but not in hyperther-
mophilic Euryarchaeota or Crenarchaeota (Goosen and Moole-
naar, 2008). Interestingly, only in Thaumarchaeota the uvrABC
genes occur in the conserved order uvrBAC, indicating that
these organisms might have maintained an ancestral operon
structure.

ASSOCIATION OF AMO GENES AND TRANSPOSASES ON FOSMID 19c08
Fosmid 19c08 encodes ten putative transposases that indicate the
presence of insertion sequence (IS) elements (Tables S1 and S2
in Supplementary Material). This fosmid could either be derived
from a genome region of high IS element activity, or could be an
indicator of a high amount of transposases in the original archaeal

stitute over 10% of the entire genome (Brugger et al., 2004) and
are comprised of 650 annotated transposases (including 89 partial
transposases in the GenBank database for S. solfataricus P2).

Seven of the transposases showed highest amino acid similarity
to bacterial transposases, that are derived from a number of IS
element families, i.e., ISH3, IS1595, IS110, and IS630 (Table S2 in
Supplementary Material). However, homologs of nearly all IS ele-
ments can also be found in archaea. Only two of the transposases,
ORF 21 and ORF 35 (Figure 4C), which are almost identical to
each other (97.9% identical on aa level) belong to an unchar-
acterized IS family. These putative transposases appear speciﬁc to
archaea and have highest similarity to the archaeal fosmid gzfos1d1
(Hallam et al., 2004). The upstream ORFs 20 and 34 are almost
identical to each other (98.8% on aa level) and are homologs to
genes on the before mentioned archaeal fosmid gzfos1d1. In con-
trast to ORF 20 and 21 that are separated by 65 nt, the transposases
encoded by ORF 34 and 35 are separated by a single−1 frameshift,
which is a common feature of diverse IS element families and
represents a means to regulate translation of transposase genes
(Figure 4C).
The fact that both IS Elements (ORFs 20+21 and 34+35)
including their ﬂanking sequences and inverted repeats are iden-
tical and even share inverted repeats (with three mismatches)
(Figure 4B) indicates that they might be able to form a composite

transposon, which could potentially mobilize all ORFs in the
region from ORF 20 to ORF 35, including amoA and amoB.

Transposition could also provide an explanation for the ﬁnding
that amoA on this fosmid is disconnected from the gene encoding
a conserved hypothetical protein which is usually found next to
amoA (Figure 5) such as ORF 38 in fosmid 54d9 (Treusch et al.,
2005). Since this hypothetical gene has always been detected in
association with other amo genes in all other currently described
AOA genomes or genome fragments, it seems likely that it is asso-
ciated with the archaeal ammonia monooxygenase and we thus
refer to this conserved hypothetical gene as “amoX.” Fosmid 19c08
represents the only known example for the separation of amoA
from “amoX.” Transposition (or recombination) may also explain
the substantial variation in gene order observed within amo gene
clusters and the opposite orientation of amoA and amoB in 19c08
compared to other amo gene clusters (Figure 5). However, whether
amoAB genes might really be mobilized can only be investigated
experimentally or by further genomic sequencing.

Interestingly, the region ﬂanked by the transposases is syntenic
to other thaumarchaeotal genomes including N. maritimus, N.
liminia and N. viennensis (Figure 4A).

COMPARISON OF AMO GENE SEQUENCES AND CONSERVED
UPSTREAM PROMOTER REGIONS
The amoA, amoB, amoC, and “amoX” gene sequences includ-
ing upstream regions from the three cave fosmids 10c16, 19c08,
and 22i07 were compared with those from thaumarchaeal
(meta)genomes (N. gargensis, N. viennensis, N. yellowstonii, N.
maritimus, N.
limnia, C. symbiosum) and fosmid sequences
(54d9, HF4000_APKG3E18 and HF4000_APKG4H17) where sev-
eral subunits were known. Phylogenetic trees of each gene, i.e.,
amoB (22i07, 19c08), amoC (22i07), and “amoX” (22i07, 10c16)
showed the same overall topology as amoA and 16S RNA gene
phylogenies (Figure 6). AmoB, amoC, and “amoX” genes of fos-
mid 22i07 cluster with the marine/Group I.1a lineage whereas
those of fosmid 19c08 and 10c16 branch within the soil/Group
I.1b lineage, respectively (Figure 6).

amoA
The 12 compared amoA gene sequences were identical in length
except for that of N. yellowstonii, which has an additional codon
(de la Torre et al., 2008). The range of identity at the nucleic acid
level was between 68% (10c16 and HF4000_APKG3E18) and 91%

Metagenomic analysis of soil AOA

(N. viennensis and 10c16). Assuming an ATG translational start
codon at the same relative position (and differing from those pub-
lished for 54d9 and the HF4000-fosmids), conserved motifs that
are typically found in basal archaeal (and eukaryotic) promot-
ers (Bell and Jackson, 2001), i.e., a TATA box and parts of a BR
element (transcription factor B recognition element) can be iden-
tiﬁed 23 nt or 24 nt upstream of all sequences (Figure 7A, boxed
sequences). This ﬁnding indicates that the amoA gene in AOA is
not co-transcribed with upstream located genes of the cluster, but
rather separately from its own promoter. As demonstrated in other
archaea (Torarinsson et al., 2005), the transcriptional and trans-
lational start sites might be located on the same nucleotide and
codon, respectively. Furthermore, both upstream and downstream
of the basal promoter elements additional conserved sequence
motifs speciﬁc for either representatives of group I.1a or group
I.1b lineages, respectively, could be identiﬁed (underlined and bold
sequences in Figure 7). These are candidates for cis-regulatory
sequences that could serve for binding of speciﬁc transcriptional
regulators.

to amoA genes,

amoB
Comparison of 10 amoB sequences showed that they were
less conserved than amoA,
i.e., between 54% (19c08 and
HF4000_APKG3E18) and 88% (N. maritimus and N. limnia)
identity. In contrast
it was impossible to
deﬁne a common translational start. Nevertheless, a common
TATA and BR element could be identiﬁed for all sequences,
though the distance to the potential translational start codon
was different (Figure 7B). In fosmids HF4000_APKG3E18 and
HF4000_APKG4H17 (which are highly syntenic to each other;
Konstantinidis and DeLong, 2008) only four or ﬁve nucleotides
separate the stop codon of amoA from the start codon of
amoB and no typical TATA or BR element was observed.
These two fosmids are the only published examples where the
amoA ORF is directly upstream of amoB, and “amoX” is in
reverse orientation to amoA (Figure 5). It is possible that these
organisms co-transcribe amoA and amoB genes as a single
polycistronic RNA.

Additional short conserved sequences upstream of amoB were
observed among group I.1a and I.1b lineages, respectively, repre-
senting putative regulatory sequences. In addition, the sequence
motif GGGAT was found in almost all published amoB sequences
directly upstream of
the potential translational start codon
(Figure 7B).

amoC
amoC has a range of identity at the nucleic acid level of 76%
(N. viennensis and HF4000_ANIW97M7) to 87% (N. maritimus
and 22i7). AmoC is absent from the amoA“X”B gene cluster
on cave fosmids 10c16 and 19c08, as well as on the marine
fosmids HF4000_APKG4H17 and HF4000_APKG3E18, soil fos-
mid 54d9 and N. yellowstonii (Figure 5). Although, automatic
genome annotations have led to the selection of different start
positions for diverse amoC genes, the high conservation and the
presence of a start codon 24 nt downstream from a potential
TATA box in all known amoC sequences indicates a common

ATG start differing from that predicted previously for C. sym-
biosum, N. maritimus, and HF4000_ANIW97M7 (Figure 7C).
Conserved sequence motifs, that represent potential regulatory
elements could not be identiﬁed for amoC genes.

‘amoX’
Comparison of 10 sequences reveals that “amoX” is the least con-
served of the four amo genes (A, B, C, and “X”). Identity at the
nucleic acid level ranges between 40% (N. yellowstonii and C.
symbiosum) and 85% (N. viennensis and 10c16). A common start
codon (ATG) and a common TATA box and BR element can be
identiﬁed for all “amoX” genes (Figure 7D). Additionally, short
conserved potential cis-regulatory sequences could be identiﬁed
between the TATA boxes and start codons. The deduced proteins
of the marine organisms were longer, encoding an additional 25 AA
spanning transmembrane domain beside the two transmembrane
domains predicted for all other “AmoX” proteins.

CONCLUSION
The cultivation of Thaumarchaeota is challenging as seen by
the limited number of representatives in laboratory culture. The
production of large-insert libraries therefore still remains a rele-
vant tool for exploring the genomic content of speciﬁc lineages.
The fosmids derived from a thermal cave expand the knowledge
on AOA of group I.1b (Nitrososphaera cluster) of Thaumarchaeota
and highlight some differences in the genomic content between
organisms of different lineages. Analysis of the upstream sequences
of amoA, amoB, amoC, and “amoX” genes revealed potential cis-
regulatory elements that might be suitable targets for the study
of gene regulation in these ammonia oxidizers. Furthermore, it
remains to be investigated to what extend mobile genetic elements
such as IS elements as identiﬁed in this study might have favored
the spread of amo genes among organisms or might inﬂuence the
architecture of thaumarchaeal genomes and their evolution.
