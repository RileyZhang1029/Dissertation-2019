Abstract
The question of how growth and size are controlled has fascinated generations of biologists.
However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. The last year or so has seen a flurry of
reports on the control of growth and body size in Drosophila, and a central theme to these papers is
the idea of signaling between organs as a control mechanism for overall body growth and
development. While this concept is obviously not new, these fly studies now open up the possibility
of using a genetically tractable system to dissect in detail how organ-to-organ communication dictates
body size.

Introduction
Why are legs longer than arms? Why is a Dalmatian bigger
than a Dachshund? The question of how growth and size
are controlled has fascinated generations of biologists.
However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear.
In recent years, the power and versatility of Drosophila
genetics, combined with some imaginative experiments
by fruit fly researchers, has revealed new ideas about the
control of animal growth. In particular, several recent
reports have shown how organ-to-organ signaling can
influence both the rate of body growth and the size of
organs. In this review, I highlight some of these key papers,
and I speculate on future research and on what the fly work
might be telling us about mammalian physiology and
growth.

Growth during the Drosophila life cycle
As they develop, Drosophila progress through three main
stages of life - embryo, larva, and pupa - before emerging as
adults. Virtually all the body growth occurs in the larval
stage, during which animals increase in mass approxi-
mately 200-fold [1]. This mass increase is dependent on
dietary protein: restriction of protein intake leads to a
reduced rate of larval growth and development, while

complete starvation triggers growth arrest [2,3]. Most of
this nutrition-dependent increase in larval mass is con-
tributed by an increase in the size of polyploid cells
(i.e. cells containing multiple copies of the normal haploid
set of chromosomes) that make up the bulk of the larval
tissues, such as muscle, fat body, gut, epidermis and
salivary gland. Nestled among these polyploid tissues are
the brain and imaginal discs, which eventually contribute
to adult structures. Communication between these differ-
ent organs and tissues is emerging as an important control
on the overall larval growth rate and body size, especially
in response to the availability of dietary nutrients. Two key
endocrine factors underlie this communication:
the
Drosophila insulin-like peptides, and the steroid hormone
ecdysone [4]. Drosophila contains seven different Droso-
phila insulin-like peptides. These are expressed in different
temporal and spatial patterns throughout larval and pupal
development [5,6]. In particular, under nutrient-rich
conditions, discrete neurosecretory cells within the brain
express and release a subset of these Drosophila insulin-
like peptides, which then circulate throughout
the
hemolymph (fly ‘blood’ or interstitial fluid) and trigger
growth in target tissues by binding to the cell surface
insulin receptor and activating a conserved intracellular

PI3 (phosphoinositide-3) kinase/Akt kinase pathway [7].
In this way, endocrine Drosophila insulin-like peptide
signaling couples dietary protein to larval growth. Ecdy-
sone is produced and released from the prothoracic gland.
Pulses of ecdysone secretion are responsible for controlling
progression through the larval period and for triggering the
onset of pupation, and, as with the Drosophila insulin-like
peptides, these ecdysone effects are controlled by dietary
protein and are dependent on ribosome synthesis within
the prothoracic gland [4,8,9]. Together, the Drosophila
insulin-like peptides and ecdysone regulate body size by
controlling both the rate and the duration of the larval
growth period. Recent studies have provided new details
and insights into how this physiological and signaling
network governs growth during fly development.

Recent advances:
Signaling from fat to brain
The larval fat body is a key nutrient-sensing organ that acts
as a buffer between fluctuating nutrient conditions and
the internal organs. For example, when larvae are deprived
of dietary protein, fat body cells undergo autophagy and
changes in lipid storage. These metabolic effects are
essential to remobilize scarce nutrients and promote
organismal survival [10,11]. In addition, the fat body
functions as an important endocrine organ that can signal
the fly’s nutritional status to other remote tissues. Over the
last decade, a series of elegant studies from the laboratory
of Pierre Leopold has shown an essential role for TOR
(target of rapamycin) kinase in one such endocrine
function of the fat body – signaling to the brain to
promote Drosophila insulin-like peptide release [12-14].
In all eukaryotes, availability of extracellular nutrients,
such as amino acids and sugars, can activate the conserved
TOR kinase, leading to changes in metabolism, growth
and proliferation [15,16]. Leopold and colleagues showed
that, in larvae, when dietary protein levels are high, amino
acid import into fat body cells stimulates TOR kinase. This
increased TOR activity then promotes the relay of a
secreted signal from the fat to the brain, which controls
the expression and release of three Drosophila insulin-like
peptides (2, 3 and 5) from neurosecretory cells [12,14].
Thus, in this way, endocrine signaling from the fat body
links nutrition to systemic insulin signaling and growth.

Two recent papers from the labs of Alex Gould and Andrea
Brand have now described how fat-to-brain signaling can
also trigger local endocrine responses in the brain to
regulate stem cell proliferation [17,18]. After hatching,
neural stem cells in the larval brain start proliferating upon
feeding. Pioneering studies over a decade ago by Britton
and Edgar showed that this nutritional response was
triggered by a secreted signal from the fat to the brain [2].
The Gould and Brand labs showed that, as with the

control of systemic Drosophila insulin-like peptide
signaling and growth, this fat body effect on neural stem
cells requires TOR activation in fat cells. In this case,
however, the fat-brain signal stimulates the release of
Drosophila insulin-like peptide 6 from glial cells in the
brain. Drosophila insulin-like peptide 6 then acts locally
to trigger neural stem cell proliferation via an insulin
receptor/PI3 kinase signaling pathway. Thus, signaling
from the fat to brain can promote both local proliferative
responses in the brain and also trigger systemic effects on
overall tissue and body growth. Together, these exciting
findings raise a number of questions. First and foremost,
what is the secreted signal from fat to brain, and is this
signal the same in the case of both local glial Drosophila
insulin-like peptide 6 release and systemic Drosophila
insulin-like peptide 2, 3 and 5 release? Second, how does
TOR signaling in the fat body regulate the secreted signal?
Stimulation of mRNA translation has been proposed to
be an important effector of TOR. So perhaps translation of
either the signal (if it is a secreted peptide) or an enzyme
that promotes synthesis of the signal may be modulated.
Indeed, a recent report showed that simply increasing
Met) in the fat body
the levels of the initiator tRNA (tRNAi
was sufficient to enhance systemic insulin signaling and
promote an increase in development and body size [19].
Importantly, these effects were associated with increased
mRNA translation and could be reversed by genetic
suppression of translational capacity. Finally, what is
the target of the fat signal? Certainly both glial and
neurosecretory cells can respond to the signal to promote
Drosophila insulin-like peptide release. But are these cells
direct targets or does the signal impinge upon other cells
to activate a neural network that ultimately promotes
Drosophila insulin-like peptide release? In the case of
the neurosecretory cells, the neurotransmitters GABA and
serotonin, and the neuropeptides Neuropeptide F and
Tachykinin-related peptide are all reported to be required
for Drosophila insulin-like peptide production [20-22],
but whether these are actually modulated by nutrition/fat
body signaling remains to be determined.

Signaling from muscle
The emerging picture from the above studies is that
signaling from fat can influence function in another remote
tissue. Recent work from Demontis and Perrimon also
showed a similar ‘remote control’ function for muscle [23].
They reported that nutrient-dependent PI3 kinase signaling
was required to control growth and development of larval
body wall muscle. Interestingly, they also showed that
inhibition of PI3 kinase in these developing larval muscles
also suppressed growth in other tissues and inhibited
overall body growth and size. These non-autonomous
effects on body size were due to effects on larval feeding
behavior following inhibition of PI3 kinase signaling in

muscle. Whether these effects require a secreted muscle-
derived factor, or whether they also rely on control of
systemic Drosophila insulin-like peptide signaling is
unclear.

Signaling from imaginal discs
The imaginal discs are organs consisting of mitotic cells
that grow and divide during the larval period. The discs
eventually undergo metamorphosis into adult structures,
such as the eyes, wings, legs and thorax, during the pupal
stage. Damage to the larval discs induces cell death and
growth arrest, followed by a period of compensatory
proliferation and growth to allow for regeneration of the
damaged tissue [24]. Importantly, developing Drosophila
larvae are able to sense this damage and, as a result, larval
development is prolonged, and growth of other tissues is
slowed while the regeneration occurs. This phenomenon
provides an example of coordination of growth between
organs to ensure proper body size and proportion. Two
recent papers shed light on mechanisms underlying this
coordination [25,26]. Parker and Shingleton showed that,
when growth is genetically suppressed in just the wing
disc, other discs and tissues show a corresponding slowing
of growth and overall larval development is delayed. They
suggested that this slowing of growth was due to reduced
ecdysone signaling as a result of growth retardation in the
prothoracic gland [26]. Similarly, Halme et al. reported
that radiation-induced disc damage also delayed larval
growth through a non-autonomous effect on ecdysone
production and release from the prothoracic gland. In this
case, the defect in ecdysone signaling was due to reduced
synthesis of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), a
neuropeptide responsible for promoting ecdysone release.
Furthermore, using a genetic screen, Halme et al. identified
a prominent role for retinoid biosynthesis in the signaling
pathway that
links tissue damage to delayed larval
development [25]. Again, as with both the muscle and
fat body, the nature of the signal emanating from growth
impaired or damaged discs is unclear. The identification of
a role for retinoids does provide a clue, although it is
unclear whether normal retinoid synthesis is required in
the damaged discs or target tissues in order for proper
‘delay development’ signals. Imaginal discs express a
variety of morphogens and secreted factors essential for
organ growth, e.g. Dpp, Wg, Hh and Egf. Moreover, the
expression of several of these is upregulated following
tissue damage, raising the possibility that they may be
involved in signaling to other tissues to delay growth and
development [27].

Signaling from gut bacteria: another ‘organ’ in
growth control?
It has been long appreciated that, in all animals, the gut is
home for large numbers of commensal bacteria [28].

Indeed, humans contain more bacterial cells within their
gut than human cells throughout their body. These
bacterial populations play an important role in controlling
host homeostasis and metabolism. Two recent papers
have identified these gut bacteria as essential components
of the control systems that govern body development and
growth in Drosophila [29,30]. Strikingly, both studies
reported that depletion of gut bacteria led to delayed
growth and smaller body size, particularly when dietary
protein was limiting. In each report, the species of bacteria
that appeared to play the dominant role on host growth
differed, as did the range of bacteria found in the fly gut.
Nevertheless, in both cases, the major influence of the
gut bacteria was to promote host insulin signaling. In
particular,
the presence of gut bacteria appeared to
augment the organ-organ signaling networks that promote
Drosophila insulin-like peptide and ecdysone release.
These findings suggest the intriguing notion that gut
bacteria act as another ‘organ’ that can signal to larval
tissues to promote both organismal growth and develop-
ment, but what underlies this ‘signaling’
is unclear.
However, Shin et al. were able to show that gut bacteria
deficient in acetic acid metabolism were deficient in the
ability to promote growth and development, and that
supplementation of a bacteria-free diet with acetic acid
could partially restore normal growth and development [29].
Given the presence of commensal bacteria in the guts of
all metazoans, it is interesting to speculate whether they also
play a similar role in controlling growth and size in other
animals.

Brain sparing during nutrient restriction
Nutrient deprivation inhibits cell growth in the bulk of the
tissues that make up the larvae, such as gut, fat, muscle and
epidermis [2]. However, an intriguing recent study from
Gould and colleagues has shown that, in contrast to these
organs, growth of the larval brain is protected from
starvation [31]. These workers found that neural progeni-
tor cells in the brain were insensitive to inhibition of both
Inr and TOR – two essential mediators of nutrient-
dependent signaling in other larval cells. Instead, Gould
and colleagues identified an alternative signaling pathway
involving the receptor tyrosine kinase Alk (anaplastic
lymphoma kinase) that functions to control brain growth.
Importantly, the ligand for Alk, Jelly-Belly, is constitutively
secreted from glial cells. Thus, even when starvation
suppresses the levels of systemic Drosophila insulin-like
peptides and inhibits growth in the majority of larval
tissues, local Jelly Belly-Alk signaling between glia and
neural cells within the brain can maintain brain growth
and size. These brain-sparing effects rely on the ability of
Alk signaling to bypass the requirement for insulin
receptor and TOR and independently regulate their key
downstream effectors, such as PI3 kinase and 4EBP. Alk is

a conserved kinase that
is highly expressed in the
mammalian CNS and overexpressed in certain brain
tumors [32]. Hence, it is interesting to speculate as to
whether these ‘brain sparing’ effects seen in Drosophila
may explain the role of Alk signaling in the mammalian
brain.

Future directions
The last year or so has seen a flurry of reports on the
control of growth and body size in Drosophila. A central
theme to these papers is the idea of signaling between
organs as a control mechanism for overall body growth

and development (see Figure 1 for summary). This
concept is obviously not new; decades of research on
the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor axis in
mammals have emphasized the role of endocrine factors
in body growth. But these fly studies now open up the
possibility of using a genetically tractable system to dissect
in detail how organ-to-organ communication dictates
body size. For example, one obvious question that these
papers leave unanswered concerns the nature of the
relevant organ-to-organ signaling molecules. Undoubt-
edly, the versatility and sophistication of Drosophila
genetics, and in particular the ability to perform targeted,

tissue-specific loss-of-function RNAi screens, will spur
research into the identification of these elusive factors.
Once we discover these secreted factors, will we find that
they are conserved, and might they play similar endocrine
roles in other animals? Certainly, the insulin-like peptides
present a strong precedent for conserved organ-to-organ
signaling networks that control body growth and size.
Nevertheless, even if the factors are not conserved, the
principle of organ-to-organ signaling and physiology as
governing mechanisms for body size control will probably
be central to animal development. And no doubt Droso-
phila research will continue to lead the way in unraveling
these mechanisms.
