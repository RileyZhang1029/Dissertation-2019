Abstract
The expression of Beta, the single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP) of bacteriophage l in Escherichia
coli promotes high levels of oligonucleotide (oligo)-mediated mutagenesis and offers a quick way to
create single or multiple base pair insertions, deletions, or substitutions in the bacterial chromosome.
High rates of mutagenesis can be obtained by the use of mismatch repair (MMR)-resistant mismatches
or MMR-deficient hosts, which allow for the isolation of unselected mutations. It has recently become
clear that many bacteria can be mutagenized with oligos in the absence of any SSAP expression, albeit
at a much lower frequency. Studies have shown that inactivation or inhibition of single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) exonucleases in vivo increases the rate of SSAP-independent oligo-mediated mutagenesis.
These results suggest that l Beta, in addition to its role in annealing the oligo to ssDNA regions of the
replication fork, promotes high rates of oligo-mediated mutagenesis by protecting the oligo from
destruction by host ssDNA exonucleases.

Introduction and context
Recombineering
It is now possible to introduce almost any desired type
of mutational alteration into the genome, phages, or
plasmids of Escherichia coli and other bacteria [1-3]. The
procedure, known as recombineering (from recombino-
genic engineering) can use either single- or double-stranded
DNA (ssDNA or dsDNA) molecules. Recombineering
with double-stranded linear DNA molecules is achieved
by expressing the Red recombination genes of bacterioph-
age lambda (l), designated exo, bet, and gam [4,5]. l Exo
0
has 5
single
strands to which Beta can bind [6,7]. l Beta belongs to a
class of proteins known as the single-stranded DNA
annealing proteins (SSAPs), which are known to promote
RecA-dependent or -independent recombination, promote
annealing of complementary ssDNA in vitro, and share a
unique quaternary structure involving the formation of
rings of varying sizes (i.e., oligomers containing 12-18

0
directionality on dsDNA to produce 3

0
to 3

subunits per ring) [8-11]. In vivo, l Beta and Exo promote
recombination between phage genomes via a RecA-
dependent or RecA-independent (ssDNA annealing)
mechanism [12]. For efficient dsDNA Red recombination,
it is necessary to inactivate the host RecBCD exonucl-
ease either by deleting the recBCD genes from the host
chromosome or by expression of the l Gam protein, which
binds to and inhibits RecBCD [13-15]. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) substrates, containing a drug marker
flanked by 40-50 bp of target DNA, are typical dsDNA
substrates for recombineering. The use of recombineering
with dsDNA PCR substrates has revolutionized the
methods employed for gene targeting of mouse cells and
metabolic engineering [3,16,17]. Targets for these experi-
ments have typically been bacterial artificial chromosomes
(BACs) containing large regions of bacterial or eukaryotic
DNA, where conventional cloning procedures using
restriction enzymes have proved too difficult or impossible
to perform.

l Red-promoted oligonucleotide-mediated
mutagenesis
Oligonucleotides (oligos; typically about 70 nucleotides)
can also be used by the l Red system to produce chro-
mosomal alterations [18]. The mutagenesis protocol is
carried out by electroporation of an oligo into cells
expressing only the l Beta protein; since the substrate is
already single-stranded, l Exo is not required. For
example, a deletion can be made by electroporating
cells expressing l Beta protein with an oligo having 35
nucleotide homologies on both sides of the target gene or
region. Oligos can also be designed to create single or
multiple base pair changes, insertions, or deletions. In
E. coli expressing l Beta, the frequency of mutagenesis for
1-bp changes is typically in the order of 0.1% of the viable
cells plated (Table 1); a phenotypic selection or screen
is typically required to easily find the mutant cell. While
this is a respectable frequency as far as gene targeting is
concerned, the real value of this method is to generate
unmarked mutations (those without an associated anti-
biotic resistance, for example), which requires higher
rates of Beta-promoted oligo-mediated mutagenesis.

This mutagenesis frequency is dependent on three condi-
tions: the sequence of the base pair change; which strand
of DNA is targeted by the oligo; and the electrocompet-
ence of the cell preparation. By far, the largest effect on the
mutation frequency can be observed by the type of change
encoded by the oligo. An oligo designed to create a 1-bp
change creates a 1-bp mismatch once the oligo is annealed
to the chromosome, and thus becomes a substrate for the
Dam-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system of E. coli
[19,20]. (This is also true for oligos containing 1- to 4-bp
insertions or deletions.) Thus, by inhibiting MMR (e.g., by
the use of mutS hosts), or by selecting mismatches that are
not easily recognized by the MMR system (e.g., C-C), one
can drive mutagenesis frequencies to as high as 25% of the

survivors of electroporation [21]. A variation of this theme
to avoid the MMR system is to flank the intended base pair
change with an additional 19 changes in the oligo
sequence [22]. Mismatched loops of 5 bp and greater are
not easily recognized by the MMR system and transfor-
mants containing all the changes are found at a relatively
high frequency using pooled transformants. A second elec-
troporation is carried out with an oligo that changes all the
bases back to the original sequence, with the exception of
the desired base change.

To further increase the mutagenic frequency, one should
design the oligo to be complementary to the lagging
strand template. It has been observed that oligos targeting
the lagging strand template exhibit 3- to 50-fold higher
mutagenesis rates relative to oligos that target the leading
strand template in E. coli [18]. This bias can reach many
thousand-fold in Mycobacterium smegmatis [23] and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (KC Murphy, unpublished obser-
vations). These differential rates of targeted gene alteration
by complementary oligos have also been observed in
mammalian cells, though the results may be influenced in
some cases by the presence of transcription through the
target site (reviewed by Engstrom et al. [24]). This bias
toward the lagging strand led to a proposed mechanism
for Beta-promoted oligo-mediated mutagenesis whereby
the ‘lagging strand’ oligo is incorporated preferentially at
the replication fork, presumably due to the increased
presence of ssDNA target sites in this region [18,25]
(Figure 1a). In this model, oligos are annealed to regions
between Okazaki fragments or perhaps even displace
them. Once annealed, the oligos get extended by DNA
polymerase I and ligated to the preceding Okazaki
fragment. That oligos are physically incorporated into
the mutagenized DNA was shown by Huen et al. [26], who
showed that biotinylated ssDNA oligos were incorporated
into plasmid substrates. The physical incorporation of the

end of the oligo as a primer. Such jumps in leading strand

oligo was previously seen by Radecke et al. [27] in a
mammalian gene targeting study.

Oligos can also target the leading strand template and
a mechanism to address this observation is shown in Figure
1b. One imagines that the oligo anneals to the leading
strand template ahead of polymerase, though at a lower
frequency relative to the lagging strand template because of
the limited amount of ssDNA in this region of the fork [28].

In this model, the leading strand polymerase would stop
0
end of the oligo, disengage the
upon encountering the 5
0
template strand, and reposition itself at the 3
end of the
oligo to reinitiate leading strand synthesis. This process
would be analogous to the one encountered by the lagging
0
strand polymerase when it encounters the 5
end of an
Okasaki fragment, where it disengages to reinitiate poly-
merization at the next priming site. This hopping capability
of the lagging strand polymerase has been demonstrated
[29] and involves interactions with the clamp loader
complex of
the replisome (see [30,31] for reviews).
Whether the leading strand polymerase possesses the
same capability is not known, but there are suggestions
it does. For instance, both polymerases are coupled by
tethering to the clamp loader [32], suggesting that the
leading strand polymerase might possess a recycling
mechanism akin to the lagging strand polymerase. Also,
both polymerases can leave gaps in their DNA strands
following encounters with template lesions (reviewed in
[33]), suggesting both polymerases can reinitiate down-
stream on their templates. Leading strand polymerase
reassembly on its template is supported by the ability of
DnaG primase to prime synthesis on the leading strand
template [34]. Thus, the leading strand polymerase likely
has the capacity to disengage its template following an
0
encounter with the 5
end of an annealed oligo, and
0
end, as depicted in Figure 1b. Other
reinitiate at the 3
models of oligo-mediated recombination, involving the
formation of D-loops, annealing of the oligo to the non-
transcribed strand of a transcription bubble, and SSAP-
directed template switches, have been discussed [24,35]
and are not mutually exclusive to the models shown in
Figure 1.

Finally, electrocompetent cells should be prepared to
maximize DNA uptake. For E. coli, this is easily carried out
using standard electrocompetent preparation protocols for
recombineering [1,2]. For species of bacteria that are not as
electrocompetent as E. coli (e.g., M. smegmatis), van Kessel
and Hatfull [23] have reported that co-electroporation of
an oligo with a selectable plasmid allows one to screen out
cells not competent for DNA uptake. They find that 3-5%
of cells that take up the plasmid (which is selectable) also
contain the unselected oligo-mediated mutation. The
strain can then be easily cured of the sacB-containing
plasmid by selection on sucrose.

Major recent advances
Other single-stranded DNA annealing proteins
l Red-promoted ssDNA oligo mutagenesis is dependent
on the expression of only the l Beta protein. Iyer et al.
[11] have previously used computational sequence
analyses to classify SSAPs into three evolutionarily
distinct superfamilies: l Beta/RecT, Erf, and Rad52.

Each superfamily has its own conserved regions of amino
acid sequence and predicted secondary structures,
suggesting that each superfamily evolved independently.
The large number of potential l Beta-like recombinases
in phage-encoded genomes suggests that other SSAPs
might also be found that promote RecA-independent
oligo-mediated mutagenesis. Some of these recombi-
nases would be expected to be well adapted for
oligo-mediated mutagenesis in their respective hosts.
To this end, Datta et al. [36] expressed a number of these
Beta-like recombinases from a set of diverse bacteria
(including Gram-positives) in E. coli, and examined their
ability to promote oligo-mediated mutagenesis. Surpris-
ingly, a number of SSAPs (from Enterococcus faecalis,
Legionella pneumophila, and Vibrio cholerae) worked quite
well in E. coli, generating recombinants at 25-100% of
the level exhibited by l Beta, while SSAPs from more
distantly related non-enteric bacteria (e.g., Bacillus subtilis
and M. smegmatis) gave recombinants at a 1000-fold
lower
than the rate of
spontaneous mutagenesis).

rate (though still higher

Likewise, van Kessel and Hatfull [23] expressed two
mycobacterial SSAPs (Che9c phage gp61 and Halo
phage gp43), RecT, and l Bet in M. smegmatis and
measured the relative efficiencies of ssDNA oligo-mediated
mutagenesis. Che9c gp61 worked most efficiently, while
the Halo gp42 SSAP gave a 10-fold lower rate of
mutagenesis. Surprisingly, the E. coli-derived RecT function
worked as well as Hal gp42, while l Beta did not work at all
(though this latter result could have been due to poor
translation of the E. coli transcript in M. smegmatis). The
lower activities of the more distantly related SSAPs in this
report and the study by Datta et al. [36] suggest a possible
interaction between the phage recombinase and a critical
host factor(s). It has been proposed that this putative host
factor may be a component of the replicon, as the
replication fork has been considered to be the most
probable target for the l Beta protein (though no physical
interactions with replication fork proteins have been
reported thus far).

Many of these SSAPs are accompanied on their respective
genomes by l-like exonucleases. In the study by Datta
et al. [36], four of the SSAPs, when expressed together
with their cognate exonucleases, generated recombinants
with dsDNA at a rate 1000-fold lower than l Red,
including two SSAPs that showed significant recombina-
tion with ssDNA. This result suggests that host proteins
may be involved with specific interactions with the
phage exonuclease function instead of (or in addition to)
the SSAP. Alternatively, it may reflect a higher stringency
of the phage recombination systems acting on dsDNA
linear substrates relative to ssDNA oligos.

Mechanism of oligo-mediated mutagenesis
It seems reasonable to assume that the ssDNA annealing
function of Beta is central to the mechanism of the high
level of mutagenesis with ssDNA oligos. This is repre-
sented in the models shown in Figure 1 by annealing of
the oligo to the ssDNA regions of the replication fork.
However, Beta may have another important role. Dutra
0
et al. [37] showed that an E. coli strain deficient for 3
ssDNA exonucleases (ExoI, RecJ, and EcoVII) was capable
of significant oligo-mediated mutagenesis in the absence
of any exogenous phage proteins (although at a lower
frequency). This result shows that Beta’s role, in addition
to its presumed annealing function,
likely includes
protection of the ssDNA oligo from degradation by
host ssDNA exonucleases. As such, this study led to
the idea that bacteria that are limited in their ssDNA
exonuclease functions may be amenable to some level of
ssDNA oligo-mediated mutagenesis in the absence of a
phage SSAP.

Recently, a study by Swingle et al. [38] showed that
the chromosome of the soil organism Pseudomonas
syringae was capable of being modified by ssDNA oligos
without expression of an exogenous phage annealing
function. Electroporation of P. syringae with 5 mg of an
oligo, designed to create a 4-bp change in the rpsL gene
that confers streptomycin resistance, generated 2400 StpR
colonies per 108 survivors (106-fold greater than the
spontaneous rate of StpR). Interestingly, when only 5-fold
lower amounts of the oligo were used, the rate of oligo-
mediated mutagenesis fell 80-fold, suggesting that
excess DNA titrates out an in vivo inhibitor (e.g., ssDNA
exonucleases) increasing the lifetime of the oligo. In
support of this mechanism, a substrate mixture contain-
ing 4 mg of a non-specific carrier oligo and 1 mg of the
StpR-targeting oligo gave mutation rates comparable to
the use of 5 mg of the targeting oligo alone. Apparently,
barriers to oligo-mediated mutagenesis can be overcome
by the use of excess oligo via a mechanism that presum-
ably saturates host ssDNA exonucleases.

SSAP-independent and -dependent oligo-mediated muta-
genic procedures share similar properties. Mutagenesis
rates of both processes show a bias toward oligos targeting
the lagging strand of the replication fork, are influenced by
the type of mismatch generated (MMR-resistant C-C
mismatches show the highest rates), and are independent
of RecA, RecB, and RecFOR. These similarities suggests that
oligo-mediated mutagenesis is an inherent process that
can occur in bacteria at some low level, and that SSAPs
like l Beta can dramatically increase that rate by efficiently
protecting the oligo from exonucleolytic attack, and
promote annealing of the oligo to ssDNA regions of the
replication fork.

One of the main differences between SSAP-dependent
and -independent mutagenesis is oligo length require-
ment. In SSAP-independent analyses, P. syringae showed
no differences in the rates of oligo-mediated mutagenesis
when oligos between 20 and 120 nucleotides were
compared [38]. In a similar test in E. coli, the difference in
SSAP-independent mutagenesis between a 20-mer and a
70-mer was only 5- to 10-fold. Conversely, maximal rates
of l Beta-promoted oligo-mediated mutagenesis are
observed with a 70-mer and drops at least three orders
of magnitude when a 20-mer is used [18]. In the case of
the Che9 gp61 SSAP, there was a dramatic 104-fold drop
in oligo-mediated mutagenesis when the length of the
oligo was reduced from 50 to 36 nucleotides, though
interestingly, the authors claim that this did not reflect
an inability of gp61 to bind to these oligos [23]. This
result is consistent with the reported binding capability
of l Beta to a 36-nucleotide oligo [39]. Clearly, the very
high rates of SSAP-dependent oligo mutagenesis require
a minimal length of about 50 nucleotides (as opposed to
20 nucleotides for SSAP-independent oligo mutagen-
esis), which likely reflects some mechanistic requirement
for SSAP-promoted protection or annealing of ssDNA
in vivo.

The study by Swingle et al. [38] also reported that the
chromosomes of E. coli, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella
typhimurium could all be modified by oligos (using rpsL
and rpoB target sites) in the absence of exogenous SSAP
function, although at much lower frequencies when
compared to SSAP-induced mutagenesis (approximately
103- to 104-fold lower). A study by Grogan and Stengel
[40] has shown that oligos can also be used to modify
the chromosome of
the hyperthermophilic archaea
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. These results, and the oligo-
mediated gene targeting events that have been observed
in eukaryotic systems for many years [41-48], show that
exogenous SSAP-independent oligo-mediated mutagen-
esis is a universal process, and that it likely shares
mechanistic similarities across all kingdoms of life.

Future directions
The ability of bacterial chromosomes and BACS to be
modified by oligo-mediated mutagenesis allows inves-
tigators precise manipulation of genes and regulatory
elements down to the single base pair level. Modifica-
tions can be induced at a reasonable frequency
(0.1%), allowing investigators to find the desired
change using pools of transformants and PCR assays.
In particular, the mismatch amplification mutation
assay (MAMA) PCR has been extremely useful, where
an amplicon is generated by the modified target site
but not the parental one [49]. Single base pair changes
can be inserted in BACs containing bacterial or

eukaryotic DNA for downstream applications
[22,50]. While the use of MMR-deficient hosts drives
the frequency of oligo-mediated mutagenesis higher,
future research that allows for increased frequencies of
recombineering in MMR-proficient cells would be
useful. This notion is based on the concern about
the off-target effects of working in an MMR-deficient
strain.

Oligo-mediated mutagenesis without the need to express
exogenous SSAPs in bacterial species other than E. coli
is useful but limited because of the low frequency of
mutagenesis (typically a limit of approximately 10–4).
However, it is helpful for those species that already have
genetic systems in place. For instance, an oligo can be
designed to excise a counter-selectable marker (e.g., sacB)
from a bacterial chromosome without leaving behind
a site-specific scar (i.e., loxP site). Investigators should
examine bacterial systems to see if this is possible, espe-
cially if DNA sequence analysis suggests a limited number
of ssDNA exonucleases are encoded in the host genome.
Also, SSAPs from phages other than lambda should
be examined for their abilities to promote high levels of
SSAP-induced oligo-mediated mutagenesis. In hosts other
than E. coli, SSAPs from endogenous phages would likely
work well to promote high rates of oligo-mediated muta-
genesis, as was recently found for M. smegmatis [23]. A clear
application of
this technology is to transfer single
nucleotide polymorphisms identified in drug-resistant
bacterial pathogens to drug-sensitive strains to identify
mutations required for bacterial resistance. Such studies
could identify the genes involved in the generation of
resistance in bacteria and help in the design of new
antibiotics.

Finally, a clearer understanding of the molecular mechan-
ism of how the oligo promotes transfer of the mutation
into the chromosome is clearly warranted. While the
mechanisms in Figure 1 are the most reasonable given the
currently available data, other mechanisms may also play
a role. Experiments should be designed to test the model
further, or perhaps reveal other mechanisms that may be
involved, including the formation of D-loops and/or
template switch mechanisms [35]. The role of transcrip-
tion bubbles as targets of the annealing function (one
model currently suggested for the mechanism of mamma-
lian targeted gene alteration [24]) is not thought to be a
significant contributor to oligo-mutagenesis in bacteria,
though it may have a role in some circumstances. One
item of special interest would be if a Beta-like analogue
exists in eukaryotes, which if transiently induced, would
promote the 103- to 106-fold increase in mammalian
targeted gene alteration, as is seen when l Beta is expressed
in E. coli cells.
