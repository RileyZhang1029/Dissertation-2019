Prokaryotic heterotrophs (hereafter, bacteria) represent a large proportion of global bio-
mass, and therefore bacterial biomass stoichiometry likely exerts control on global phos-
phorus (P), carbon (C), and nitrogen cycling and primary productivity. In this study we grew
recently isolated freshwater heterotrophic bacteria across an ecologically relevant range
of resource C:P ratios (organic C to P ratio in available resources) to quantify the P require-
ments of these organisms and examine the degree to which they regulated their P content
under P-sufﬁcient and P-deﬁcient conditions. Bacterial biomass was only limited by P when
resource C:P was greater than 250 (by atoms). Bacterial C:P ranged from 71 to 174 under P
sufﬁciency and from 252 to 548 under P deﬁciency. Bacteria exhibited very little C:P home-
ostasis under P-sufﬁcient growth conditions, greater C:P homeostasis under P-deﬁcient
conditions, and the ability of bacteria to outcompete one another in short-term experi-
ments depended on a tradeoff between storing excess P for later use under P-deﬁcient
conditions or immediately using P to produce more biomass. These results indicate that
freshwater heterotrophic bacteria are not as P-rich as previously thought and that home-
ostatic regulation of C:P stoichiometry depends on the individual taxa and what resource
(organic C or available P) is limiting bacterial growth. Individual bacterial populations can
vary between strong C:P homeostasis under P deﬁciency to virtually no C:P homeostasis
under P sufﬁciency, but variation between taxa and the effect this has on competitive ability
may dampen the signal in C:PB at the bacterial community level. Nevertheless, the preva-
lence of homeostatic and non-homeostatic strategies in a bacterial community should have
important implications for nutrient regeneration and carbon cycling.

INTRODUCTION
Prokaryotic heterotrophs (hereafter, bacteria) can inﬂuence the
availability of phosphorus (P) in soils, lakes, and oceans (Cotner
and Biddanda, 2002; van der Heijden et al., 2008), which effectively
controls primary production in many ecosystems (Elser et al.,
2007). Bacteria are thought to be substantial nutrient sinks because
they often outcompete autotrophs for nutrients in nutrient-poor
environments (Cotner and Wetzel, 1992; Nordin et al., 2004;
Thingstad et al., 2008). However, competitive P uptake and immo-
bilization by bacteria should only occur during P-deﬁcient growth,
when the organic carbon (C) to P ratio in the available resources
(C:PR) is greater than the C:P required for bacterial biomass
(C:PB).

There are very few data available on the stoichiometric require-
ments of bacteria in nature, particularly as it relates to resource
ratios. Bacteria are often assumed to be nutrient-rich (Sterner and
Elser, 2002) because their growth rates can be rapid, and rapid
growth requires substantial P for DNA replication and ribosome
production (Makino et al., 2003; Chrzanowski and Grover, 2008).
Cleveland and Liptzin (2007) suggested that soil microbes were
substantially more P-rich (C:P≈ 60:1) than terrestrial autotrophs

(C:P≈ 900:1–2500:1). However, Cotner et al. (2010) found no
difference in the elemental composition of bacterioplankton and
phytoplankton growing along a gradient of P availability in
lakes.

Although a number of factors, such as growth rate and tem-
perature, can affect bacterial stoichiometry (Cotner et al., 2006;
Chrzanowski and Grover, 2008), resource ratios may have the
greatest inﬂuence (Chrzanowski and Kyle, 1996; Makino et al.,
2003). But, the few studies that have explored the effect of
resource ratios on bacterial stoichiometry were conducted using
Escherichia coli (Makino et al., 2003) and Pseudomonas ﬂuo-
rescens (Chrzanowski and Kyle, 1996). These model organisms
have grown for many generations on nutrient-rich laboratory
media, perhaps altering their potential responses to varied nutri-
ent availability. New data are needed that show how variation
in resource ratios affect the elemental composition of recently
isolated bacterial strains or natural bacterial communities.

Bacteria can regulate their biomass composition homeostati-
cally so that it is within a narrower range than the resource ratios
present in the environment (Makino et al., 2003). The degree of

the variability occurring in C:PR. Conversely, H
weak or no elemental homeostasis and suggests that the C:PB of
a population is effectively identical to C:PR (Sterner and Elser,
2002).

The C:P homeostasis, or the lack thereof, in bacteria should
inﬂuence the fate of these elements in the environment (Figure 1).
For example, strong homeostasis at a low C:PB by bacteria would
be an excellent strategy for rapid growth when P is abundant,
but would require that these organisms slow or halt growth while
waiting for available P during P deﬁciency, thereby decreasing their
growth efﬁciency (BGE; ratio of bacterial biomass production to
respiration). Conversely, weak homeostatic regulation of C:PB by
bacteria would result in more biomass production per unit P dur-
ing P deﬁciency, allowing bacteria to maintain a relatively high
BGE, but during P sufﬁciency growth efﬁciency would decrease
due to a low C:PB. However, weak C:PB homeostasis would enable
bacteria to accumulate P during P sufﬁciency. Quantifying these
patterns of bacterial stoichiometry is fundamental to understand-
ing how bacterial P immobilization or mineralization may affect
ecosystem functions, such as primary production, on a global scale.
The objective of this study was to quantify the C:P stoichiometry
of heterotrophic bacteria across a range of ecologically relevant
resource C:P ratios. We combined stoichiometric theory with con-
tinuous culture growth of recently isolated bacteria to determine
the relative P composition of bacterial cells and the degree to which
bacteria regulate their elemental composition homeostatically.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL ISOLATIONS, CULTURE CONDITIONS, AND GROWTH RATES
Bacterial strains were isolated from several freshwater lakes in MN
and VA, USA. Bacterial cultures were established by ﬁrst streaking
water samples onto undeﬁned culture media (Difco nutrient agar,
cellulose+ Difco nutrient agar, or LB agar). Individual colonies
were harvested from plates after visible growth had developed and
transferred onto a new plate. This process was repeated two to
three times in order to isolate individual bacterial strains. Bacterial
isolates were identiﬁed by 16S rRNA gene sequences as described
previously (Ghosh and LaPara, 2007). Brieﬂy, genomic DNA was
puriﬁed from each bacterial strain and used as template for PCR
targeting the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene using primers 8F
(cid:3)
(5

). These PCR products were
then puriﬁed using a GeneClean II kit (MP Biomedicals; Irvine,
CA, USA) and used as template for nucleotide sequence analysis
(cid:3)
(cid:3)
using primers 338F (5
)
and 907R (5
). Sequenc-
ing was performed at the Advanced Genetic Analysis Center at
the University of Minnesota using an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Consensus sequences
from bi-directional sequence information were then compared
with sequences obtained from the GenBank database using the
BLASTN program (Benson et al., 1999) in order to determine the
phylogenetic afﬁliation of the isolate.
Isolates were transferred to plates containing deﬁned, P-rich
(C:P= 10) culture media (Tanner, 2007), then grown to their max-
imum density on the same media in liquid form. Stock samples
were collected from these liquid cultures and stored at −80˚C
with 15% glycerol. Prior to experiments, a single isolate stock was
thawed and streaked onto a plate containing P-rich, deﬁned culture
media. Cultures were grown at 25˚C until there was visible growth
and then refrigerated for no more than 90 days. Although we iso-
lated over 100 strains, we chose six isolates for experimentation
that were phylogenetically diverse. These six isolates represented
ﬁve genera from three different bacterial phyla. For all experi-
ments, a single colony was extracted from a plate and grown for
24–36 h in deﬁned, P-rich (C:P= 10), liquid media. One milliliter
of this liquid culture was then used to seed continuous cultures
(100 ml chemostats). The use of continuous culture chemostats
allowed us to control the growth rates of organisms in an ecolog-
ically relevant range. Prior to experiments, the maximum growth
rate (μmax) of individual strains on P-rich deﬁned media was
determined by measuring the change in biomass [measured as
optical density (O.D.) at 600 nm] of batch cultures over a 24- to
36-h period.

CHEMOSTAT EXPERIMENTS
A replicated chemostat experiment was conducted using one iso-
late (Arthrobacter sp.) to determine the degree of variability in
biomass [measured as particulate carbon (PC) from cultures],
bacterial phosphorus [measured as particulate phosphorus (PP)
from cultures], and C:PB (molar ratio of PC and PP) at three dis-
crete levels C:PR. Experiments were conducted in a temperature
controlled room at 25˚C. The dissolved organic C concentration of
culture media was kept constant (27 mM C from glucose) across all

iﬁed to achieve C:PR of 10 (n = 4), 100 (n = 4), and 1000 (n = 5).

Dilution rates of all chemostats were set at 25% μmax (0.1 h
for Arthrobacter sp.). Filtered air was continuously pumped into
chemostats to aerate and homogenize cultures. Experimental con-
ditions were maintained until biomass (measured O.D. of chemo-
stat efﬂuent) was stable for 24 h, which resulted in experiments that
lasted between 4 and 6 days and provided 5–15 complete ﬂushes
of the chemostats. Duplicate culture samples from each chemostat
were vacuum ﬁltered (<250 mmHg) onto pre-combusted GF/F
ﬁlters for PC analyses and onto acid-washed GF/F ﬁlters for PP
analysis. PC was measured on a Perkin Elmer Elemental Analyzer
2400 CHN. PP was measured colorimetrically with molybdenum
blue (APHA 2005) following acid-persulfate digestion.

Six different unreplicated P-gradient experiments were con-
ducted with each of the six bacterial isolates (population P-
gradient experiments), where populations of the individual iso-
lates were grown across a gradient of P concentrations. The P
concentration of deﬁned liquid culture media was modiﬁed to
achieve C:PR ratios of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2500,
and 5000 based on the expected maximum range of variability in
nature (Makino et al., 2003). Chemostat dilution rates were set at
25% μmax for each isolate and operated and sampled as described
above.

A P-gradient experiment was also conducted using a mixed-
culture of Arthrobacter sp. and Flavobacterium sp.-51 (mixed-
culture P-gradient experiment). The experimental gradient and
experimental procedure was identical to the population P-gradient
experiments except that equivalent amounts of both bacterial iso-
lates were used to inoculate the chemostats simultaneously. The
equivalent amounts of Arthrobacter sp. and Flavobacterium sp.-51
cultures were derived by adjusting the seed volumes based on the
O.D. of each of the pure isolate liquid cultures at the time of seed-
ing in order to achieve equally weighted initial biomass of both
isolates. In addition to the C and P measurements from mixed-
culture experiments, we also measured the relative abundance
of each bacterial strain using ampliﬁed ribosomal DNA restric-
tion analysis (ARDRA) as described by Fernandez et al. (1999).
Brieﬂy, genomic DNA was extracted and puriﬁed as described
above. PCR was then used to amplify a fragment of the 16S rRNA
gene using primers 8F and 907R. These PCR products were puri-
ﬁed (GeneClean II) and digested with MseI restriction enzyme.
Digested DNA was then resolved on 1.5% agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide and compared results obtained from pure
cultures (as positive controls).

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
The effects of varying C:PR on bacterial biomass as PC, bacterial
P (PP), and C:PB in the replicated experiment were tested with a
one-way ANOVA’s using PROC GLM in SAS 9.1 (SAS, 2003). Dif-
ferences among individual means were tested using the REGWQ
multiple comparison procedure controlling family wise error at

α= 0.05. The effect of varying C:PR on bacterial biomass as PC

in the gradient experiments was assessed across all isolates with
a one-way ANOVA using PROC GLM in SAS (SAS 2003). Differ-
ences among mean bacterial biomass across C:PR were tested using
the REGWQ multiple comparison procedure controlling family

wise error at α= 0.05. The effect of varying C:PR on bacterial

phosphorus (PP) in the gradient experiments was assessed across
all isolates with regression analysis by ﬁtting an exponential decay
function to mean PP data for all isolates.

Data from these experiments were also separated into P-
sufﬁcient and P-deﬁcient cultures based on the results of the
bacterial biomass ANOVA and a visual inspection of the C:PR
versus C:PB scatterplot. A two-way ANOVA was conducted to
examine if differences in C:PB were caused by differences among
isolates or differences in P availability (P-sufﬁcient or P-deﬁcient),
or if there was a signiﬁcant interaction between sources of vari-
ation. Differences among mean C:PB were tested when omnibus
F-tests were statistically signiﬁcant at α= 0.05 using the REGWQ
multiple comparison procedure controlling family wise error at
α= 0.05.

The relationship between log C:PR and log C:PB for all cul-
tures was quantiﬁed using locally weighted regression (LOESS)
in Sigma Plot 10.0 with a sampling proportion of 0.5 and a ﬁrst
order polynomial function (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA,
USA). When this relationship appeared linear across the entire
range of C:PR, a linear regression was ﬁt to the entire dataset using
PROC GLM in SAS 9.1 (SAS 2003). In instances when the rela-
tionship between log C:PR and log C:PB was not linear across the
entire range of C:PR, separate linear regressions were generated
between log C:PR and log C:PB for P-sufﬁcient and P-deﬁcient
cultures using PROC GLM in SAS 9.1 (SAS 2003). The degree of
C:PB homeostasis (H
) exhibited by each isolate was calculated as
described previously using the slope from the appropriate linear
regression equations. The C:P threshold element ratio (TER) for
each isolate, which approximates the element ratio at which organ-
isms transition between C and P limitation, was estimated as the
value at which C:PB was approximately equal to C:PR according
to the LOESS regression between log C:PR versus log C:PB. The
C:P reported here is an underestimate of the actual C:P TER of
an organism because it focuses on the C requirements for biomass
and ignores the C requirements for metabolism.

RESULTS
POPULATION STOICHIOMETRY EXPERIMENTS
Arthrobacter sp. biomass (as PC) in chemostats was not differ-

ent among different C:PR when C:PR was ≤100, but was 6×
lower when C:PR was 1000 (Figure 2A). Arthrobacter sp. P con-
tent in chemostats with C:PR = 10 were 6×–60× greater than
Arthrobacter sp. P content in chemostats with C:PR = 100 and
1000, respectively (Figure 2B). Arthrobacter sp. C:PB increased
with increasing C:PR, but the response of C:PB to changing C:PR
was not 1:1 (Figure 2C).

The biomass of all bacterial cultures (as PC) in P-gradient

experiments was highest when C:PR was ≤250, and exhibited a
monotonic decrease with increasing C:PR above this threshold
(Figure 3A). Bacterial P content of all isolates decreased expo-
nentially across the entire range of C:PR (Figure 3B). Substantial
variability existed in C:PB across all isolates. C:PB was always
greater than C:PR in cultures grown at C:PR < 250, and C:PB was
always less than C:PR in all isolate cultures grown at C:PR > 250
(Figure 3C). All but one isolate (Flavobacterium sp.-51) had a
C:PB value less than C:PR when grown at C:PR = 250. The mean

slope ∼ 1) with log C:PR. However, the slope of this line decreased
dramatically for both Flavobacterium sp.-64 and C. cellulans dur-
ing P deﬁciency. This pattern indicates that Flavobacterium sp.-64
and C. cellulans exhibited virtually no homeostasis during P sufﬁ-
ciency but weak homeostasis during P deﬁciency (Figure 3E). The
relationship between log C:PR and log C:PB in Flavobacterium sp.-
51 and Aeromonas sp. was also non-linear across the entire range of
C:PR (Figure 3F). During P sufﬁciency, log C:PB of Flavobacterium
sp.-51 and Aeromonas sp. increased almost proportionately (i.e.,
slope ∼ 1) with log C:PR. However, the slope of this line decreased
to almost zero for both Flavobacterium sp.-51 and Aeromonas sp.
during P deﬁciency. This pattern indicates that Flavobacterium
sp.-51 and Aeromonas sp. exhibited virtually no homeostasis dur-
ing P sufﬁciency but exceptionally strong homeostasis during P
deﬁciency (Figure 3F).

MIXED-CULTURE STOICHIOMETRY EXPERIMENT
The mixed-culture of Arthrobacter sp. and Flavobacterium sp.-
51 exhibited weak homeostatic regulation of C:PB during P
sufﬁciency, but strong homeostasis during P deﬁciency (Figure 4).
The C:PB of this mixed-culture resembled the C:PB of Arthrobac-
ter sp. during P sufﬁciency, but more closely resembled the
C:PB of Flavobacterium sp.-51 during P deﬁciency. Cultivation-
independent community analysis using ARDRA conﬁrmed that
Arthrobacter sp. dominated the mixed-culture when C:PR < 250
(log C:PR < 2.4), but Flavobacterium sp.-51 dominated the mixed-
culture when C:PR ≥ 250 (log C:PR ≥ 2.4; Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
Phosphorus immobilization or mineralization by bacteria can
have profound effects on ecosystem functions such as primary
productivity (Cotner and Biddanda, 2002; van der Heijden et al.,
2008). However, other than simple experiments using E. coli
(Makino et al., 2003) and P. ﬂuorescens (Chrzanowski and Kyle,
1996), the biological stoichiometry of bacteria, which controls the
balance P immobilization and mineralization in microbial het-
erotrophs, has been largely ignored. The reasons that it has been
ignored is due to the difﬁculty of measuring bacterial stoichiom-
etry in natural systems, and the notion that bacteria in nature
are both nutrient-rich and relatively invariant in nutrient con-
tent. The traditional paradigm of bacterial stoichiometry has been
that bacteria are P-rich, with C:P ratios ranging from 15 to 70
(Tuomi et al., 1995; Vadstein, 2000), and that bacteria regulate their
elemental composition homeostatically within a relatively narrow
range (Makino et al., 2003). More recent studies have indicated that
bacteria may actually be much less P-rich than previously thought
(Gundersen et al., 2002; Løvdal et al., 2007; Cotner et al., 2010).
Our study indicates that P-limited bacteria are neither P-rich nor
are bacteria invariant in nutrient content. Rather, the elemental
composition of bacteria can vary substantially depending on what
element (carbon or phosphorus in this study) is limiting growth
and the growth strategies of individual bacteria that are dominant
(elemental homeostasis or non-homeostasis).

If bacteria in nature were always P-rich, as has been suggested
from experiments with model organisms (Chrzanowski and Kyle,
1996; Makino et al., 2003), taxa should be P-limited when C:PR
ratios are >50–100. Our results show that a decrease in bacterial

C:P TER for all the isolates combined was 233. Two-way ANOVA
revealed no difference in C:PB between different isolates (F = 1.52;
p = 0.2036) and no interaction between isolate and P availability
(F = 1.26; p = 0.3014). However, mean C:PB in P-sufﬁcient cul-
tures (101± 72.3) was 4× lower than mean C:PB in P-deﬁcient
cultures (438± 278; F = 36.8; p < 0.0001).

The relationship between log C:PR and log C:PB in Arthrobacter
sp. and Cellvibrio gilvus was approximately linear, and the slope
of the best ﬁt line was relatively shallow across the entire range of
C:PR (Figure 3D). This indicates that Arthrobacter sp. and C. gilvus
exhibited weak homeostatic regulation of C:PB during both P suf-
ﬁciency and P deﬁciency (Figure 3D). In contrast, the relationship
between log C:PR and log C:PB in Flavobacterium sp.-64 and Cel-
lulomonas cellulans was non-linear across the entire range of C:PR
(Figure 3E). During P sufﬁciency, log C:PB of Flavobacterium
sp.-64 and C. cellulans increased almost proportionately (i.e.,

biomass occurred only when C:PR > 250, suggesting that cellular
bacterial demand for P can be much lower than is often assumed.
Furthermore, bacterial P content decreased rapidly with increas-
ing C:PR, which means that bacterial C:PB was always greater than
C:PR when C:PR < 250 and less than C:PR when C:PR ≥ 250. This

shows that the stoichiometry of individual bacterial populations
is somewhat ﬂexible with regard to P demand. Mean C:PB in P-
sufﬁcient cultures (101± 72.3) was 4× lower than mean C:PB
in P-deﬁcient cultures (438± 278), and C:PB in some of the P-
limited cultures was >500:1, providing further evidence that these
organisms could grow with very little P in biomass.

Four of the six bacterial isolates in this study accumulated
excess P under P-sufﬁcient conditions, i.e., non-homeostasis,
while the other two strains generated biomass proportionally to
P availability under P sufﬁciency, thereby demonstrating C:PB
homeostasis. Conversely, four of the six isolates exhibited weak
C:PB homeostasis under P deﬁciency while two others exhibited

very strict C:PB homeostasis during P deﬁciency. Several mecha-
nisms have been documented that could explain these patterns.
First, bacteria that were non-homeostatic during P sufﬁciency
may have accumulated excess P in polyphosphates (Kulaev and
Kulakovskaya, 2000) in order to fuel short-term growth or even
increase their motility and survival when P is much less available
(Thomas and O’Shea, 2005). Bacteria exhibiting weak home-
ostasis during P deﬁciency may have modiﬁed C:PB by increas-
ing their cell size along one axis in order to increase P afﬁnity
and decrease grazing pressure without changing their cell quota
(Thingstad et al., 2005). Alternatively, these organisms could
increase their cellular P acquisition machinery, which are com-
posed of P-poor biochemicals (Klausmeier et al., 2004), or even
substitute sulfur or nitrogen for P into lipids in order to use
the replaced P for sustained growth, similar to what has been
demonstrated in some marine picocyanobacteria (Van Mooy et al.,
2009).

analysis (ARDRA) for each of the treatments in the mixed-culture experiment
and the reference migrations of Arthrobacter sp. and Flavobacterium sp.-51.

The different stoichiometric patterns exhibited among bacter-
ial isolates could represent an important ecological tradeoff. For
example, Arthrobacter sp. and C. gilvus remained weakly homeo-
static under P sufﬁciency (i.e., when C:PR < 245 or < 263, respec-
tively; Figure 3D). Based on this evidence, stoichiometric theory
(Figure 1) tells us that Arthrobacter sp. and C. gilvus likely become
net P mineralizers when C:PR is less than ∼ 250. In contrast,
Flavobacterium sp.-51 and Aeromonas sp. were non-homeostatic
when P was sufﬁcient and effectively accumulated excess P when
C:PR was <302 or <155, respectively (Figure 3F). Interestingly,
Flavobacterium sp.-51 and Aeromonas sp. were strongly home-
ostatic during P deﬁciency (Figure 3F), but Arthrobacter sp.
and C. gilvus remained weakly homeostatic during P deﬁciency
(Figure 3D). Therefore, a tradeoff may exist whereby organisms
which are very strictly homeostatic during P deﬁciency must accu-
mulate excess P (i.e., no homeostasis) during P sufﬁciency. On the
other hand, a more ﬂexible organism during P deﬁciency (i.e.,
weak homeostasis) may not need to accumulate excess P during P
sufﬁciency and thereby use the available P to build more biomass
and keep their C:PB elevated. Of course, the temporal frequency
and duration of transitions between P sufﬁciency and P deﬁciency
may determine which stoichiometric growth strategy is favored in
nature, which would have an important effect on P cycling rates
in nature.

If maximizing C:P were a ﬁtness goal of bacterial populations,
homeostatic bacteria should be favored during P sufﬁciency (low
C:PR) and non-homeostatic bacteria should be favored under
P deﬁciency (high C:PR) because more biomass is accumulated
per unit P in both cases (Figure 1). However, the results from
the mixed-culture experiment showed that the more homeostatic
bacteria dominated at both low C:PR, i.e., C limitation (Arthrobac-
ter sp.), and high C:PR, i.e., P limitation (Flavobacterium sp.-51;

Figure 4). This caused the mixed-culture to behave more homeo-
statically than individual strains, which is in contrast to theoretical
predictions (Danger et al., 2008). However, it is possible that
Flavobacterium sp.-51 used P stored during P sufﬁciency (ini-
tial growth phase in chemostats) to outcompete Arthrobacter sp.
during short-term P deﬁciency experienced in these chemostat
experiments. Long periods of P deﬁciency in nature would prob-
ably overextend the ability of P accumulating bacteria to use
stored P for growth. Therefore, less homeostatic bacteria should
dominate under long-term P deﬁciency because they create more
biomass per unit P than more homeostatic organisms, which sup-
ports the notion that bacterial communities in nature exhibit weak
homeostasis in elemental composition (Makino and Cotner, 2004;
Danger et al., 2008).

The patterns of bacterial stoichiometry observed in this study
help explain why bacteria are so effective at acquiring P rela-
tive to autotrophs in P-limited ecosystems (Cotner and Wetzel,
1992; Nordin et al., 2004). Short-term labile organic C sup-
plements in soils (Dunn et al., 2006), lakes (Stets and Cotner,
2008), and oceans (Thingstad et al., 2008) can decrease primary
production due to bacterial competition for limiting nutrients,
which is consistent with our observation of P accumulation by
non-homeostatic bacteria during P sufﬁciency. However, C:PR
depends not only on the absolute C and P concentrations, but
also on the relative lability of organic C. Labile carbon and
microbial biomass generally decrease together with increased dis-
tance from the plant rhizosphere (Kennedy, 1998), and bacte-
ria respond more effectively to pulses of phytoplankton-derived
C than pulses of allochthonous C in the aquatic environment
(McCallister and del Giorgio, 2008). This suggests that loca-
tions or periods of high primary productivity could increase the
realized C:PR for bacteria and effectively induce competitive P

uptake by bacteria, potentially diminishing primary production.
But, decreased primary production also should reduce labile car-
bon availability, which effectively decreases C:PR and promotes
bacterial P mineralization.

Given that primary production in many ecosystems can experi-
ence frequent P limitation (Elser et al., 2007), and that a large pro-
portion of biomass in all ecosystems is comprised of heterotrophic
bacteria (Whitman et al., 1998; Biddanda et al., 2001), our study
suggests that these feedbacks may constitute a major control on
the global C cycle. Bacterial stoichiometry may play a particularly
important role in this dynamic by providing a biogeochemical
“set point” around which environmental variation is regulated.
Although our results are limited to organisms that could be
cultivated, these bacteria included ﬁve different genera represent-
ing three bacterial phyla (Table 1). Therefore, genetically diverse
microbial communities may also be stoichiometrically diverse,
but greater exploration of the potential stoichiometric diversity
of microbes is desperately needed. Furthermore, more work is
needed to understand how these bottom-up controls may inter-
act with top-down pressures to inﬂuence bacterial stoichiometry.

The C:P TER of recently isolated strains was much higher than
that observed in model organisms (Table 1), and some bacte-
ria showed similar degrees of homeostasis under both C and P
limitation, but most strains were more homeostatic under P lim-
itation than C limitation. While our work suggests that this set
point may vary within and across strains, understanding how these
stoichiometric relations are maintained or not in bacterial com-
munities has important implications to the net balance of nutrient
consumption or regeneration in ecosystems.
