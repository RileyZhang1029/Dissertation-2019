The deleterious and sometimes fatal outcomes of bacterial infectious diseases are the net result of the
interactions between the pathogen and the host, and the genetically tractable fruit
fly, Drosophila
melanogaster, has emerged as a valuable tool for modeling the pathogenhost interactions of a wide variety
of bacteria. These studies have revealed that there is a remarkable conservation of bacterial pathogenesis and
host defence mechanisms between higher host organisms and Drosophila. This review presents an in-depth
discussion of the Drosophila immune response, the Drosophila killing model, and the use of the model to
examine bacterialhost interactions. The recent introduction of the Drosophila model
into the oral
microbiology field is discussed, specifically the use of the model to examine Porphyromonas gingivalishost
interactions, and finally the potential uses of this powerful model system to further elucidate oral bacterial-
host interactions are addressed.

Introduction

The use of invertebrate animal models has provided

tremendous insight into the pathogenhost inter-
actions of many human pathogens, and has
revealed that many aspects of these interactions in higher
host organisms are conserved in invertebrates. One of
these animal models, the genetically tractable fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila), has been well
established as a model for studying the hostpathogen
interactions of bacterial (19), fungal (1017) and viral
pathogens, and prior to the sequencing of the mosquito
genome and the subsequent development of genetic tools,
the malaria parasite (2326); the model has also been
used to probe the host defense response to infection.
first provide an overview of

the
Drosophila model and address the advantages and draw-
backs of the model for studying pathogenhost interac-
tions. Next, the Drosophila immune response will be
described in detail, and the various ways that the model
has been used to study bacterialhost interactions will be
addressed. Finally, the studies that used the Drosophila
model to investigate Porphyromonas gingivalishost inter-
actions will be reviewed, followed by a discussion of the
potential contributions that can be made using this
model, toward a better understanding of oral bacteria
host interactions.

D. melanogaster as a model for studying

hostpathogen interactions

Numerous studies have revealed that there is significant
homology between the Drosophila immune response and
the mammalian innate immune response (discussed in
depth below). The absence of an adaptive immune
response permits the study of the interactions between
pathogens and the host’s innate immune response in
isolation. Drosophila are affordable to breed, are easy to
handle, have a short generation time (1014 days
depending on the ambient temperature), have a clear
endpoint (death), and can be used in quantities large
enough to permit statistical analysis of the data. The
Drosophila genome is fully sequenced (2729), and
numerous well-developed genetic tools are available for
the manipulation and analysis of Drosophila responses
[reviewed in (30, 31)]. Transposon mutagenesis has been
used to successfully create loss-of-function mutants of at
least 53% of Drosophila genes, with the ultimate goal of
inactivating all genes (32, 33). Mutations are usually
linked to visually identifiable markers, e.g. eye color or
wing morphology, to allow for easy identification of
mutant animals. Technologies for transgenic expression
of genes in Drosophila are well developed (3437) and
have been enhanced by the development of expression
systems like upstream activation sequence (UAS)/GAL4

(yeast transcription activator) (38, 39) that allow for
temporally and spatially regulated expression;
linking
transgenes with reporter genes like lacZ (b galactosidase)
or gfp (green fluorescent protein) allows gene expression
to be monitored. Mutant and transgenic Drosophila lines
are readily available at stock centers and have been
extensively used to probe the interactions between
pathogens and the Drosophila host. Drosophila loss-of-
function immune response gene mutants have been used
to examine the roles of the genes in the response to
infection with various pathogens [(11, 16, 19, 4043) and
Table 2], and transgenic Drosophila have been used to
monitor the activation of immune response pathways
upon infection (44, 45) and to examine the effects of
transgenically expressed pathogen proteins on the host
(21, 26, 46). Microarray and proteomic platforms as well
as RNA interference (RNAi) lines and libraries have been
developed and used to perform genome-wide analyses
of Drosophila responses, in whole animals (41, 4756) and
in the well-established Drosophila cell culture lines,
Schneider-2 (S2, embryonic-derived phagocytic cell) and
(5659). As an
malignant blood neoplasm (mbn-2)
estimated 50% of Drosophila genes have mammalian
homologs (60), results from these and other studies are
relevant to mammals. A comprehensive collection of
Drosophila information can be found online at FlyBase
(http://www.flybase.net) (61), including but not limited to
gene annotation information, stock availability, images,
references, and investigator contact information. Other
databases containing Drosophila information include
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP), Droso-
phila Interactions Database (DroID), and FlyView.

It is important to note that as Drosophila are not
natural hosts for most of the human pathogens studied
with this model and lack homologs for many mammalian
immune response features, e.g. adaptive immunity, care
should be taken when translating findings to mammals.
Drosophila are usually reared at room temperature
(258C), and they can be incubated at temperatures of
up to 308C during infection experiments without affect-
ing survival, although males become sterile at
this
temperature. Above 308C, Drosophila physiological pro-
cesses begin to deteriorate, and they are rapidly killed at
378C (62), which is the optimal growth temperature for
most human pathogens. In addition, some pathogen
virulence genes are selectively expressed at 378C, which
could result in the absence of a virulence phenotype in the
Drosophila model. Although the Drosophila hemolymph
(blood) is not involved in respiration, it receives oxygen
via the trachea, which likely makes it an inhospitable
environment
for obligate anaerobes. The Drosophila
model may be more suitable for studying aerobic and
facultatively anaerobic microbes; however, the model has
been successfully used to examine the interactions
between the obligately
anaerobic oral bacterium

P. gingivalis and the host. Even though P. gingivalis did
not multiply in the flies, the bacterium viably persisted in
them for up to 60 h after infection, likely aided by its high
degree of aerotolerance (63).

In summary, the availability of a large number of well-
developed tools for manipulating Drosophila genetics and
analyzing Drosophila immune responses make it a power-
ful model for studying pathogenhost interactions, and
numerous studies have convincingly demonstrated that
strong correlation exists between microbial pathogenesis
in mammals and in Drosophila.

infecting microbes, and like mammals,

The Drosophila immune system
Drosophila rely solely on an innate immune system to
combat
they
detect the presence of invading microbes using pattern
recognition receptors, which recognize conserved micro-
bial motifs and activate a response that is specific for the
type of invading microbe [see (64) for a recent review].

Humoral immune response
The Drosophila humoral response is mediated by three
signaling pathways: the Imd (immune deficiency), Toll,
and JAK/STAT (janus kinase/signal
transducer and
activator of transcription) pathways (Fig. 1). The hall-
mark of this response is the transient synthesis and
release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by the fat body
 the major immune responsive tissue in Drosophila and
the mammalian liver 
the functional equivalent of
directly into the hemolymph, where they accumulate to
their effective concentrations. The Toll and Imd pathways
are major regulators of Drosophila immune response
genes and have been very well studied [see (65) for a
recent in depth review].

The Imd pathway
The Imd signaling pathway (Fig. 1) is homologous to the
mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 signaling
pathway, though they differ at the level of detection/
activation. This pathway regulates both systemic and
local (in response to natural infection) AMP expression,
by fat body cells and gut epithelial cells, respectively, in
response to primarily Gram-negative bacterial infections
[(6668) also see Table 2].

inhibitor of apoptosis-2 (dIAP2) (75) and transforming-
growth-factor-b activating kinase (dTAK1, IkB-kinase-
kinase) (68) are also recruited, and dTAK1 becomes
activated by TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2). dTAK1
phosphorylates the IkB-kinase complex (IKKb/Ird5 and
IKKg/Kenny) (76), which in turn phosphorylates the
dual domain nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) family
protein Relish (7779). Relish is cleaved, possibly by
DREDD, which separates the inhibitory ankyrin domain
from the Rel-homology domain (80). The phosphorylated
Rel domain then translocates into the nucleus where it
activates the transcription of Imd regulated genes (81)
(discussed below).

Downregulation. To prevent the deleterious effects of an
unchecked inflammatory response, the Imd pathway is
regulated on multiple levels. Several PGRPs function as
N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases that scavenge and
degrade PPG, converting it into non-immunostimulatory

fragments. These include PGRP-SC1, -SC2 (82), -SB1
(83), and LB, which is itself upregulated by the pathway
creating a negative feedback loop (84). PGRP-LF is a
membrane-bound receptor that sequesters DAP-type
PPG and prevents it from binding to PGRP-LC and
activating Imd signaling (85). Two proteins Caspar (Fas-
associated factor 1 homolog) and Dnr1 block DREDD
mediated cleavage of Relish (86, 87). Pirk/Rudra/PIMS
(PGRP-LC-interacting inhibitor of Imd signaling) func-
tions in a negative feedback loop to disrupt Imd/PGRP-
LC binding and inhibit Imd signaling (8890), and the
Ras/MAP kinase
[mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)] pathway negatively regulates Imd pathway
activation by modulating the expression of Pirk/Rudra/
PIMS (91). Finally, a ubiquitin-proteasome complex
represses Imd signaling by degrading one of the pathway
components, likely Relish (92).

The Toll pathway
The Toll signaling pathway (Fig. 1)
is homologous
to the mammalian Toll/IL-1 receptor-signaling pathway,

recognition molecules PGRP-SA (95) and Gram-negative
binding protein 1 (GNBP1) (98), which function in a
complex (99), and PGRP-SD (100). The Toll pathway is
also activated in response to the detection of fungal cell
wall b-1-3-glucans by GNBP3 or by the activation of the
Drosophila protease Persephone by fungal- and bacterial-
secreted virulence factors (101104). A common proteo-
lytic cascade is activated downstream of the recognition
molecules (105) that culminates in the activation of
Spatzle processing enzyme (SPE), which cleaves and
activates the cytokine Spatzle (106). Activated Spatzle
binds to the cell transmembrane receptor, Toll, and
induces the receptor’s dimerization, which recruits the
adaptors, Drosophila myeloid differentiation factor 88
(dMyD88, homolog of mammalian MyD88), Tube
(serine-threonine kinase), and Pelle (homolog of mam-
malian IL-1R associated kinase) intracellularly (96, 107).
Subsequent to Pelle activation Cactus (inhibitor of kappa
B, IkB) becomes phosphorylated and is then degraded,
freeing the (NFkB) family proteins Dif and Dorsal to
translocate into the nucleus and activate the expression of
Toll-regulated genes (108111). A functional redundancy
exists between Dif and Dorsal in the control of immune
response gene expression (as measured by drosomycin
induction) in Drosophila larvae (112), but not in adults
where Dif alone is sufficient for the induction of defensin
and drosomycin (113), and the presence of either protein
is sufficient for the induction of cecropin (94). Also,
deformed epidermal autoregulatory growth factor 1
(Deaf1) is required downstream of Dorsal and Dif to
activate genes (e.g. drosomycin) in response to fungal
infections (114).

Downregulation. Like the Imd pathway, the Toll path-
way is negatively regulated on multiple levels. Toll path-
way activation induces the expression of Cactus (NFkB
inhibitor) (115) and WntD (Wnt inhibitor of Dorsal)
(116), creating negative feedback loops. Drosophila Ubc9
(dUbc9) also inhibits Toll pathway signaling at the level
of Dif and Dorsal
(117). Finally, a serine protease
inhibitor (Spn1) acts upstream of SPE to downregulate
Toll signaling in response to fungal
in a
negative feedback manner (118).

Toll- and Imd-regulated genes
The Toll and Imd pathways regulate the expression of a
subset of Drosophila genes that are induced upon septic
injury (52, 53, 56). There is clearly some functional
overlap and synergy in gene regulation between the
pathways, as revealed by microarray- (53) and RNAi-
analyses (119), the detection of Dif-Relish heterodimers
in fly extracts (120), and the observation that Pseudomo-
nas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocy-
togenes and Ehrlichia chafeensis activate both signaling
pathways (4, 121123). The most well characterized
Drosophila immune effectors regulated by the pathways
are the AMPs, of which there are seven classes. Cecropin
(antibacterial) (124) and Defensin (antibacterial) (125)
form ion channels in the cytoplasmic membrane (126,
127), diptericin (antibacterial)
(128) and drosomycin
(antifungal) (129, 130) act on the cytoplasmic membrane
causing lysis (131, 132), Attacin (antibacterial) (133)
interferes with outer membrane synthesis (133), Drosocin
(antibacterial) (134) interferes with the activities of DnaK
(135), and the mode of action of Metchnikowin (anti-
bacterial and fungal) (136) has not yet been determined.
The Toll and Imd signaling pathways together regulate
most of the AMPs, but diptericin and drosomysin are
primarily regulated by Imd and Toll, respectively, and are,
therefore, used to monitor pathway activation (53, 66,
137). Microarray analysis showed that 283 of 400
previously identified (52) Drosophila immune response
genes are regulated by either one or both pathways. In
addition to the AMPs and pathway regulators,
the
proteins encoded by these genes are involved in iron
metabolism, opsonization, melanization, iron sequestra-
tion, coagulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produc-
tion,
stress
response, and many proteases (53).

receptor) (140, 141). Upd3 binding induces Domeless
dimerization and the intracellular recruitment and phos-
phorylation of two Hopscotch (JAK) molecules, followed
by two STAT92E (homolog of mammalian STAT5)
molecules. Activated STAT92E molecules dimerize and
translocate into the nucleus where they activate the
expression of target genes (139).

Regulated genes. The JAK/STAT pathway regulates
numerous physiological processes [reviewed in (142,
143) including immune responses; however, the contribu-
tion of this pathway to immune regulation has not been
as well studied as the Toll and Imd pathways. In response
to septic injury, the JAK/STAT pathway induces the
expression of CG11501, which remains functionally
uncharacterized (56) and, in combination with several
other pathways (144), induces the expression of Turan-
dots, which are stress-response proteins currently found
only in Drosophila (145). The pathway is involved in the
immune response in the Drosophila gut, where it helps
maintain epithelial cell homeostasis, by regulating stem
cell proliferation (51, 146). Activation of the JAK/STAT
pathway in response to an intestinal Serratia marcescens
infection negatively impacts Drosophila survival (51).

Downregulation. The JAK/STAT pathway is regulated
on multiple levels like Imd and Toll. Drosophila protein
inhibitor of activated STATs (dPIAS) inhibits STAT92E-
dependent transcription by physically interacting with
and blocking its DNA binding ability (147). Suppressor
of cytokine signaling 36E (SOCS36E, mammalian soc5
homolog) expression is induced by JAK/STAT signaling
and inhibits the pathway in a negative feedback loop
(148, 149); a truncated form of STAT92E, which is
transcribed from an alternate promoter, acts as a
dominant negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling
(150); eye transformer, a receptor that is structurally
related to Domeless, negatively regulates JAK/STAT
signaling by interfering with STAT92E phosphorylation
and activation (151).

Although the Drosophila antiviral immune response is
not well characterized, a role for the Imd, Toll, and JAK-
STAT pathways has been demonstrated (156159).

Cellular immune response
The Drosophila cellular immune response is mediated by
three sets of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and
lamellocytes, and while all three are found in larvae, only
plasmatocytes are found in adults (160).

Plasmatocytes
These cells are similar to mammalian macrophages in that
they express scavenger receptors (70, 161165), secrete
cytokines (139, 166), and are responsible for the phago-
cytosis of microbes (45, 167170) and apoptotic cells (167,
171). Drosophila plasmatocytes also contribute to hemo-
lymph coagulation by secreting the major clotting factor
hemolectin (172), promote tolerance to intracellular
bacterial infection (see below) (173), and utilize autophagy
to control some intracellular pathogens (see below).

Phagocytosis. Phagocytosis involves several receptors
many of which have mammalian homologs [see (174)

The Drosophila melanogaster host model

for a recent in-depth review of Drosophila phagocytosis].
These include EGF repeat containing proteins Nimrod
(162), Eater (161), and Draper (121),
the scavenger
receptors Croquemort
(CD36 family), Peste (CD36
family) (165, 175), and Scavenger receptor CI (dSR-CI)
(163), PGRP-LC (70), and Down syndrome cell adhesion
molecule (Dscam, homolog of mammalian DSCAM)
(164). Thus far, convincing in vivo evidence for the role of
receptors in phagocytosis has only been obtained for
Eater (161) and Nimrod (162). Phagocytosis may also be
enhanced by the thiolester proteins (TEPs), which are
members of the complement C3 (C3)/a2-macroglobulin
(a2M) superfamily. The Drosophila genome encodes four
Teps (IIV) that are expressed at basal levels by fat body
cells and larval hemocytes but strongly upregulated after
a bacterial challenge (I, II, and IV in larvae and II and IV
in adults); a fifth gene Tep V is believed to be a
pseudogene (176). In vitro RNAi treatment of Drosophila
S2 cells revealed that Teps II and III enhance the
phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and S. aureus, respec-
tively, likely by functioning as opsonins, while a sixth
protein Tep VI (also known as macroglobulin comple-
ment related, Mcr) binds to and enhances the phagocy-
tosis of Candida albicans (177). It has been suggested that
Tep II may function as an a2M by virtue of its five splice
isoforms that only differ in a domain that is similar to the
bait region of a2Ms (176); however, this function has not
been demonstrated. Although an in vivo role for the Teps
(II and IV) in combating P. gingivalis infection has
recently been demonstrated (178), Teps IIV have been
found to be dispensable for Drosophila survival after
infection with a variety of other bacterial and fungal
pathogens (179). RNAi studies have demonstrated that
phagocytosis involves actin rearrangement (7, 177, 180),
and phagocytosed microbes are taken up into a phago-
some (57) and destroyed by mechanisms that are not yet
clearly understood.

Autophagy. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved
process by which cells envelope their cytoplasmic contents
into double-membrane vesicles and, subsequently, deliver
them to the lysosome for degradation. It is involved in the
control of intracellular pathogen infections in mammals
and was first reported as a Drosophila immune response by
Yano et al., who observed that in vivo RNAi targeting an
essential autophagy factor (Atg5) rendered Drosophila
more susceptible to infection by the intracellular pathogen
L. monocytogenes (181). They subsequently observed
L. monocytogenes containing autophagosomes in Droso-
phila hemocytes using electron microscopy and identified
the intracellular form of PGRP-LE (which detects DAP-
type PPG) as the receptor responsible for the induction of
autophagy. Autophagy is a part of the Drosophila antiviral
immune response; however, the initiating receptor remains
unidentified (182). Autophagy can also promote infection

by pathogens such as the intracellular fungus Cryptococcus
neoformans, which co-opts the autophagic system to
maintain its lifestyle within Drosophila plasmatocytes

in Drosophila larvae,

Lamellocytes and crystal cells
Only present
these cells are
involved in encapsulation (lamellocytes) and melaniza-
tion (crystal cells),
immune responses that have no
mammalian counterparts. Parasites that are too large to
be phagocytosed, e.g. wasp eggs, are surrounded by
lamellocytes and encapsulated, walling them off from
the rest of the hemocoel (body cavity) (183, 184). The
encapsulated particle is then destroyed by the local
production of ROSs
(187), and
melanization, which is the synthesis and deposition of
toxic melanin (188, 189). Melanization also occurs at the
site of a cuticle breach and in Drosophila adults.

(185, 186), RNSs

Coagulation
Coagulation is an immediate reaction that occurs at the
site of a wound and prevents hemolymph loss, promotes
wound healing, and acts as a secondary barrier to
infection by immobilizing microbes (190, 191). Studies
on hemolymph clots from Drosophila larvae revealed that
the most abundant protein in the clot is hemolectin
(homolog of mammalian clotting factor von Willebrand
factor), which is secreted by plasmatocytes (172, 190,
192). Once the primary clot fibers have been formed, they
are cross linked to each other and to other clot proteins
like Fondue (193), by the enzyme transglutaminase
(homolog of mammalian factor XIIIa) (194). Transglu-
taminase also accumulates on the surface of microbes and
targets them to the clot, a role also observed for factor
XIIIa in mammals (195). Drosophila clotting factor
mutants have coagulation defects and are more sensitive
to microbial infection (172, 190, 195).

Additional immune response features
MAPK pathways
Two MAPK pathways, the p38 MAPK pathway and
the JNK pathway, contribute to the Drosophila immune
response and are homologous
to the mammalian
pathways.

p38 MAPK pathway. p38 signaling in Drosophila has
been shown to be involved in mediating stress responses
(196198) and immunity (40, 173, 199). Two MAPKs,
p38a and p38b, are encoded by the Drosophila genome
(196, 199), and they are activated in response to infection
by the upstream MAPK-kinase (MKK) Licorne (homo-
log of mammalian MKK3) (199), which itself is activated
by the MKK-kinase MEKK1 (homolog of mammalian
MEKK4) (196, 198200). Once activated, p38 can then
regulate the activity of transcription factors, such as

ATF2 and d-Jun to control gene expression (199, 201).
p38 null Drosophila are more susceptible than wildtype
animals to killing by bacterial (40, and Igboin et al.,
unpublished) and fungal pathogens (40). Also overexpres-
sion of p38b conferred increased survival to Drosophila
infected with intracellular bacteria (e.g. Salmonella typhi-
murium) without a corresponding decrease in bacterial
load, and this was due to a p38b-dependent sequestering
of the bacteria within plasmatocyte phagosomes (173) (see
below for a discussion of tolerance). p38 signaling is
negatively regulated by Alphabet, a phosphatase that
antagonizes MEKK1 phosphorylation (202).

In Drosophila,

immune activation of
JNK pathway.
JNK pathway signaling can occur via the binding of
the cytokine Eiger (mammalian tumor necrosis factor
homolog) to its receptor Wengen (mammalian TNF
receptor homolog) (203205), also via the Imd pathway
at the level of dTak1 (76), and mediates apoptosis, wound
healing, morphogenesis, and immunity (206208). Down-
stream of Eiger/Wengen binding, one or more JNK
kinase kinases (JNKKK) are activated by currently
poorly understood mechanisms. The JNKKK dTak1, a
shared component with the Imd pathway (76), activates
two JNKKs, Hemipterous (mammalian MKK7 homo-
log) and Mkk4 (mammalian MKK4 homolog) (209),
which in turn activate Basket (mammalian JNK homo-
log) (199, 209, 210). Activated JNK can then turn on the
expression of transcription factors like AP1 (211) and
other target genes. JNK signaling regulates a subset of
immune response genes induced after septic injury (56)
and also regulates AMP gene expression by the Imd
pathway, downstream of Relish (212, 213). It has been
reported that Drosophila JNK signaling in response to
infection can either be beneficial or detrimental, as
evidenced by the observation that Eiger null mutants
are more susceptible than wildtype animals to killing by
some pathogens, e.g. P. gingivalis and S. aureus (178,
214), but are more resistant than wildtype animals to
killing by some intracellular pathogens, e.g. S. typhimur-
ium (1, 214). It has also been reported that Eiger null
mutants are no more susceptible to Gram-positive cocci,
including S. aureus,
infections than wildtype animals
(215). Several negative regulators of JNK signaling have
been identified, including Alphabet, a phosphatase that
antagonizes dTAK1 phosphorylation (202), Pva (recep-
tor tyrosine kinase) and Peroxiredoxin (redox sensing
enzyme), which antagonize dTAK1 phosphorylation of
JNK (216, 217), Puc, a phosphatase that antagonizes
JNK activity (218), and Relish, whose activation results
in proteosomal degradation of dTAK1 (219).

recently described immune responses of Drosophila.
Tolerance differs from resistance,
in which the host
reduces the fitness of the pathogen, thereby reducing
the pathogen load. Tolerance in Drosophila has only been
observed in response to bacterial
infections, and the
hallmarks of this response are increased fly survival
without a corresponding decrease in the bacterial load
(1, 173, 220, 221) or an increase in bacterial load with-
out a corresponding decrease in fly survival
(222).
As examples of the first scenario, S. typhimurium-infected
eiger null Drosophila survived 3 days longer than wt
animals even though their bacterial loads were similar (1),
and Drosophila overexpressing p38b survived S. typhi-
murium, L. monocytogenes, and Legionella pneumophilia
than wildtype animals without a
infections
reduction in bacterial
load (173). The mechanism of
tolerance to S. typhimurium was shown to be via the
sequestration of the bacteria within Drosophila hemo-
cytes. As an example of the second scenario, wildtype
and CG3066 (signaling protease involved in melaniza-
tion) null Drosophila were killed at
the same rate
by Burkholderia cepacia, even though up to 25 times
more bacteria were present
in the mutant animals
(222).

Reactive intermediate production
As mentioned previously, ROSs, e.g. superoxide anion,
and RNSs, e.g. nitric oxide, are produced in Drosophila
larvae during the melanotic encapsulation of particles
that are too large to be phagocytosed (185, 186, 223).
They also play a role in the immune response in the
Drosophila gut where they are induced in response to
natural infection (i.e. ingestion) (224, 225).

Drosophila dual oxidase (dDuox) is present on gut
epithelial cells and contains a nicotinamide-adenine-
dinucleotide-phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase domain and
a peroxidase domain. The NADPH oxidase domain
generates superoxide anion, which dismutates to hydro-
gen peroxide (H2O2), and the peroxidase domain uses the
H2O2 to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl)
(224).
Excessive ROS production is prevented by immune
responsive catalase, which converts the H2O2 to water
and oxygen (226).

NO participates in signaling in the gut of Drosophila
larvae, which upregulate nitric oxide synthase expression
upon natural infection with some Gram-negative bac-
teria. NO contributes to the induction of the AMP,
diptericin, in the gut and hemocytes of naturally infected
Drosophila larvae, and pharmacological
inhibition of
NOS has been shown to impair the ability of Drosophila
larvae to survive septic and natural infections (225). The
availability of a NO synthase null Drosophila mutant
should shed additional light on the role of NO in the
immune response.

The Drosophila melanogaster host model

Iron sequestration
The Drosophila genome encodes conserved iron-binding
proteins transferrin (227) and ferritin (228), which can
limit iron availability to invading microbes. Transferrin,
ferritin, and iron transporters are upregulated in response
to microbial challenges, which suggests a role for iron
sequestration in controlling microbial
in
Drosophila (49, 50, 52, 227, 229).

infections

RNA interference (RNAi)
RNAi
involves the sequence-specific degradation of
mRNA and is involved in the Drosophila antiviral
immune response (19, 22, 230, 231). The role of RNAi
in the Drosophila immune response was first reported by
Li et al., who observed the accumulation of Flockhouse
virus (FHV)-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in
infected S2 cells (232). Galiana-Arnoux et al. (233),
Zambon et al. (234), and van Rij et al. (230) demonstrated
an in vivo role for RNAi in combating viral infections.
Drosophila also possess dsRNA uptake machinery (235,
236), which is important for the systemic RNAi response
to extracellularly released (by controlled export or from
lysed host cells) viral RNA (237).

In summary, three distinct pathways, Imd, Toll, and
JAK/STAT, mediate the Drosophila humoral response,
and the main humoral effectors are the AMPs, which are
synthesized and secreted by the fat body. Two MAPK
signaling pathways, JNK and p38, also regulate Droso-
phila immune responses, and all five signaling path-
ways are homologous to the pathways in mammals.
The cellular immune response in Drosophila adults is
mediated by plasmatocytes, macrophage-like cells that
detect the presence of invading microbes via scavenger
receptors, and phagocytose and subsequently destroy said
microbes. Phagocytosis may be aided by the Teps, C3/
a2M family proteins that function as opsonins. Addi-
tional Drosophila immune defense strategies include the
production of reactive intermediates (oxygen and nitro-
gen), RNAi (to combat viral pathogens), the seques-
tration of
intracellular
pathogens), and endurance of infections.

Drosophila infection models
Drosophila cultured cell lines (S2 and mbn-2), embryos,
larvae, and adults (male and female) have been used to
study hostpathogen interactions; however, adults and
cultured cells are the most widely used. Drosophila
embryos, larvae, and adults offer the advantage of whole
animal models to examine pathogenhost interactions,
and in all
for pathogen
virulence is fly mortality. A Drosophila embryo model
was developed to study Photorhabdus asymbiotica infec-
tion, as it offered the added advantage of allowing the
interaction between the bacterium and actively migrating
Drosophila hemocytes to be followed in vivo, and in real

time, using confocal microscopy (238). Drosophila larvae
and adults have been used to identify and characterize
pathogen and host
factors that promote or inhibit
infection by pathogens like P. gingivalis (63, 178),
Pseudomonas fluorescens (3, 239), P. aeruginosa (40,
122, 240), Vibrio cholera (241243), S. aureus (244, 245),
Klebsiella pneumonia (246), Streptococcus agalactiae
(247), West Nile virus
fumigatus
(13, 17), and Rhizopus oryzae (41). Drosophila adults
have also been used to test the efficacy of antifungal (248
251) and antibacterial drugs (252254) and other anti-
bacterial therapies (255, 256). It is important to take into
account
the immunological differences between the
models when choosing one. For example, Drosophila
larvae possess all three types of hemocytes but adults
possess only plasmatocytes. Also, larval hemocytes do
not actively migrate to a site of infection but rather arrive
there by direct capture from the open circulatory system,
in which they are passively pumped around (257).

Drosophila S2- and mbn2-cell lines are used as models
for plasmatocytes because they are immunocompetent,
phagocytic, and express many plasmatocyte-specific sca-
venger receptors. They are very useful for studying the
phagocytosis, trafficking, proliferation, and cell-to-cell
spread of pathogens (2, 121, 177, 180, 258) and for large
scale screening by RNAi to identify host factors that
interact with pathogens (20, 51, 259262).

Routes of infection
Three routes of infection have been used to introduce
pathogens into Drosophila: injection/septic injury, inges-
tion/natural infection, and rolling (in fungal spores). The
injection method introduces the pathogen directly into
the Drosophila hemocoel and involves either pricking the
body cavity (usually the thorax in adults) with a needle
dipped into a concentrated culture or the injection of a
the pathogen using a nanoinjector.
precise dose of
Ingestion is also referred to as natural
infection and
involves introducing the animals into vials containing
filter disks soaked with media containing the bacterium
of interest or vials containing a pregrown lawn of fungal
spores. Some ingestion models require that the animals be
starved prior to their introduction into food containing
vials, which drives subsequently ingested food to the crop.
The rolling method of infection has only been used with
fungal pathogens and involves rolling the flies over a lawn
of spores growing on a plate. The rolling and injection
methods of infection require anesthetization, which is
usually done with carbon dioxide, and the injection and
rolling methods
the
animals into vials with food. After infection, the animals
are incubated at 25308C (embryos are covered with oil),
and their survival is monitored. It is important to note
that the route of infection affects the interaction of
the pathogen with the host and can give different results.

transfer of

For example, the alb1 gene is involved in A. fumigatus
virulence when the fungus is ingested by or introduced
onto the cuticle of Drosophila but not when the fungus is
injected into the animals (17).

Transgenic expression (non-infection based)
In situations where the Drosophila model is not permis-
sive for infection,
it has been possible to introduce
pathogen virulence factors into the flies by transgenically
expressing the virulence factors in the animals. Pathogen
genes can be expressed ubiquitously (26) or in specific fly
tissues such as the fat body (21), wings (263), and eyes
(264) by placing the transgene under the control of tissue-
specific promoters. This has facilitated the identification
of host cell targets of Plasmodium sporozite proteins (26),
anthrax lethal
factor and edema factor (263, 265),
pertussis toxin (266), HIV-1 viral protein U (21), and
Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early protein BZLF1 (264)
(Table 1).

Drosophila as a model for analyzing bacterial
virulence
Numerous studies have shown that bacterial virulence
factors that are important for the successful infection of
mammals are also involved in infecting Drosophila (1, 63,
170, 238, 240, 246, 247, 252, 254, 263, 267). Bacterial
virulence factors that promote or inhibit infection in
Drosophila, many of which are also involved in mamma-
lian infection, are listed in Table 1. These include
F. novicida oxidative stress transcriptional regulator,
OxyR (268), L. monocytogenes actin polymerization
protein, actA (4), and V. cholera toxin (252). P. aeruginosa
has been extensively studied using the Drosophila model
[see (64) for a recent review], and in the interest of brevity,
this section of the review will address the use of the model
to study Francisella tularensis virulence.

subspecies,
F. holartica, F. tularensis, and F. novicida, cause disease
in humans and are vectored by blood-sucking insects. F.
tularensis is able to infect and propagate in Drosophila
mbn2 (170) and S2 cells (269) in vitro, killing the cells in
the process. The bacterium also infects and kills adult
flies in a dose-dependent manner (170, 269). Injection of
GFP-expressing F. tularensis enabled the systemic spread
of
the bacteria and their localization to Drosophila
hemocytes (about 55% of the bacteria were intracellular
at the time of death) to be observed. Similar to infections
in human cells, the bacteria are taken up into phagosomes
in Drosophila S2 cells, which do not fuse with lysosomes,
and from which the bacteria can escape within 3060 min
postinfection (269). The intracellular growth locus (igl)

and macrophage growth locus (mgl) are involved in F.
tularensis virulence in mice (270), and when several genes
from these loci were mutated and the null mutants tested
in Drosophila, they were found to be less virulent than the
wildtype parental strain (170, 269).

Two hundred and forty-nine F. novicida transposon
insertion mutants were individually evaluated in a
Drosophila killing model, and 49 genes that were required
for normal virulence in the flies were identified (Table 1)
(271). The majority of the identified genes were novel
F. novicida virulence factors; 43 mutants had attenuated
killing, and the mutated loci in these strains included
most of the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) genes;
six mutants were hypervirulent in the model and included
mutants in pilus assembly proteins, an outer membrane
protein and a kinase. Most of the attenuated strains also
had low proliferation abilities in mammalian macro-
phages (murine J774 cells), and many of them also
demonstrated reduced cytotoxicity;
the hypervirulent
mutants were significantly more cytotoxic to the murine
macrophages than the wildtype strains. The strong
correlation between F. novicida mutant phenotypes in
Drosophila and in mouse macrophages suggested that the
survival of F. novicida-infected flies is a good indicator of
the bacterium’s pathogenesis in mammals.

A F. novicida transposon mutant library was screened
to identify genes that were essential for growth and
survival in Drosophila, and 149 negatively selected genes
(56 confirmed, Table 1) were identified (268). Sixty of the
genes had previously been identified as virulence factors
in murine models. Seven of the negatively selected genes
encoded proteins that are important for the bacterium’s
ability to resist oxidative damage, and the mutants
showed increased sensitivity to reactive-oxygen producing
agents in subsequent in vitro experiments. Screening the
library in wt and Imd pathway-null Drosophila identified
a subset of seven F. novicida genes that are required to
resist Drosophila Imd-regulated defenses (genes that were
negatively selected in wt flies but rescued in the mutant
flies). Five of
the seven mutants showed increased
sensitivity to AMPs, modeled by polymyxin B, which
are the main Imd-regulated immune effectors. The two
mutants that showed no phenotype in the AMP killing
assay were attenuated due to other Imd-dependent
mechanisms, as similar levels of AMPs were induced in
response to infection with these mutants as with the wt
strain. Five genes, recB, pilA, pilB, pyrF, and manB,
identified in this study as being essential for F. novicida
growth and survival within the fly, were also identified by
Ahlund et al. as being involved in F. tularensis virulence
in Drosophila (271).

Another F. novicida transposon mutant library (3,050
alleles representing 1,448 genes) was first screened in
cultured S2 cells to identify genes required for the
intracellular proliferation of the bacterium, and then, a

The Drosophila melanogaster host model

subset of the mutants was tested for their lethality in
adult flies (Table 1) (58). Three hundred and ninety-four
genes that when mutated resulted in a significant reduc-
tion in intracellular growth of
the bacterium were
identified, and 80 of the 168 subsequently tested mutants
exhibited reduced lethality and proliferation in the adult
animals. The mutated loci encoded FPI proteins and
proteins involved in metabolism, type IV pili biogenesis,
transport, and DNA modification. One hundred and
thirty-five genes were also required for F. novicida
replication in human macrophages. Genes that were
newly identified as playing a role in F. novicida pathogen-
esis may not be identifiable by currently available
mammalian models, or could be specifically required
for the insect phase of the bacterium’s life cycle. Four
genes, minD, iglC, iglD, and FTN_0109, identified in this
study as being impaired in growth and/or lethality in
Drosophila, were also identified by Ahlund et al. as being
involved in F. tularensis virulence in Drosophila (271).
Seven genes, ruvC, glpD, mdaB, ilvE, kdpC, pilQ, and
FTN_1014, identified in this study, were also identified
by Moule et al. as being essential for F. novicida growth
and survival within the fly (268).

The studies described above and referenced in Table 1
show that bacterial pathogens utilize many of the same
virulence mechanisms to infect mammals and Drosophila,
and that the Drosophila model is useful for identifying
novel virulence factors.

Drosophila as a model for analyzing the host
response to bacterial infection
The host response activated upon a bacterial infection
can fight and resolve the infection or contribute to the
pathology caused by the infection, and the vast array of
Drosophila mutant and transgenic lines, and microarray,
RNAi, and proteomics platforms has facilitated in-depth
analyses of the host response to infection by a variety of
pathogens. The results of studies in which several
different Drosophila tools (immune response gene mu-
tants, transgenic expression, whole genome microarray,
and RNAi) were exploited to examine the host response
to infection are discussed in this section of the review.
Drosophila genes that are involved in the response to
human bacterial pathogens are shown in Table 2.

Loss-of-function immune response gene mutants
A large collection of loss-of-function Drosophila mutants
have been generated by numerous investigators in the
field and are readily available for use to identify
Drosophila immune response components that play a
role during infection. The use of knockout mutants of
pathway components demonstrated that the well-char-
acterized Toll- and Imd-signaling pathways are involved
in the response to a variety of bacterial infections (4, 45,
49, 122, 170, 272275). For example, Drosophila Dif

(NFkB)-null mutants were more susceptible to killing
than wt animals by L. monocytogenes, demonstrating a
role for the Toll pathway in the defense against the
bacterium (4). Imd pathway mutants were more suscep-
tible than wildtype animals to killing by F. tularensis LVS
(170), and both Imd and Toll mutants were more
susceptible to killing by Erlichia chaffeensis (45). Once a
Drosophilapathogen model has been established, mu-
tants that are deficient in specific host processes can be
used to examine the interaction between those processes
and the microbe. For example, Phg1 (nonaspanin)-null
Drosophila were found to be highly susceptible to Gram-
negative (P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae)
bacterial infections, and it was demonstrated that this
enhanced susceptibility was due to the inefficient phago-
cytic abilities of the fly hemocytes (276).

A large library of 1,231 transposon insertion mutants
representing 8% of the Drosophila genome was screened

to identify host genes required to survive a L. mono-
cytogenes septic injury infection (277). Eighteen Droso-
phila mutants with increased susceptibility to killing by
the bacterium were identified (Table 2), and the mutated
loci
included those involved in ubiquitination, RNA
processing, and transcription activation. A comparison
of the growth rates of L. monocytogenes in sensitive
mutants and wildtype animals identified two classes of
mutants: those in which bacterial growth was elevated
relative to wildtype and those in which the bacterial levels
remained unchanged relative to wildtype. This suggested
that the first class of mutants is immunocompromised,
i.e. deficient in genes required to resist the L.monocyto-
genes infection, while the second class of mutants has
reduced endurance-characterized by lowered survival
without a corresponding increase in bacterial prolifera-
tion-to the bacterial infection. Surprisingly, no overlap
was observed between the Drosophila genes identified in

this study and genes identified in two previous RNAi
screens, likely because the use of S2 cells for the RNAi
screens limited the observations to the processes involved
in the interaction between L.monocytogenes and just one
type of cell, whereas the whole animal model allowed for
a much wider variety of processes to be examined.

An even larger library of 6,200 Drosophila transposon
mutants was screened for altered susceptibility to a V.
cholera natural infection, and 16 mutants were identified
that contained disruptions in genes encoding proteins
with homology to conserved domain proteins or mam-
malian proteins of know function (242) (Table 2). Seven
of the Drosophila mutants demonstrated enhanced resis-
tance, while nine demonstrated lowered resistance relative
to the wildtype strain. Interestingly, the Imd pathway was
found to contribute to pathology under normal circum-
stances (i.e. pathway mutants were more resistant to
infection). It was determined that the mechanism of Imd
involvement in causing pathology was due in part to an
enhancement of cholera toxin activity, as imd pathway
mutants were more resistant than wildtype animals to
killing by a cholera toxin null V. cholera mutant. A
significantly higher number of apoptotic intestinal epithe-
lial cells was observed in infected imd pathway mutants
than in wildtype animals, which suggested that under
normal circumstances programmed cell death- a defense
mechanism against intracellular pathogens in eukaryotes-
is repressed by the Imd pathway in response to V. cholera
infection.

Transgenic Drosophila
As discussed above (Routes of infection), transgenic
Drosophila expressing pathogen virulence factors have
been used to identify host targets. Host genes that are
absent from Drosophila have also been transgenically
expressed in the flies to study their interactions with
pathogens. For example, the paraoxonase (PON) family of
enzymes can degrade the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing
(QS) signaling molecule N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine
lactone, and although they are conserved in mammals
and Caenorhabditis elegans, the enzymes are absent from
Drosophila. A QS deficient P. aeruginosa strain, synthetic
acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and Drosophila over-
expressing human PON1 were used to examine the effect
of the enzyme on the signaling molecule and on P.
aeruginosa virulence in vivo (278). Drosophila that were
infected with the P. aeruginosa QS-deficient mutant and
ingested a control sucrose solution survived significantly
better that flies that ingested synthetic AHLs, showing
that QS is important for P. aeruginosa virulence in vivo.
When human PON1 was overexpressed in the Drosophila,
the animals were protected from the lethality of a wildtype
P. aeruginosa infection. When AHLs were administered to
P. aeruginosa QS mutant-infected Drosophila, PON1
overexpressing Drosophila but not wildtype animals were

The Drosophila melanogaster host model

protected from killing, which showed that the basis of the
observed protection was the inactivation of the AHLs by
PON1. Therefore, the manipulation of PON expression
could be explored as a treatment for some infectious
diseases. In another study, it was observed that Drosophila
overexpressing rhodanase, a bovine enzyme that detoxifies
cyanide, survived longer than wildtype animals when
infected with cyanogenic P. aeruginosa strains (279).

Whole genome microarray analysis
Whole-genome transcriptional profiling of whole animals
has been used to assess the Drosophila global immune
response to various infections (280, 281). The transcrip-
tional profiles of Drosophila septically infected with
virulent (PA14) and avirulent (CF5) strains of P. aerugi-
nosa were compared, in order to identify defence-specific
(expression altered after CF5 infection) and
genes
pathogenesis-specific genes
(expression altered after
PA14 infection)
(280). Based on these criteria, 213
defence-specific genes (133 upregulated, 80 downregu-
lated) and 28 pathogenesis-specific genes (16 upregulated,
12 downregulated) were identified. Interestingly, while
infection with strain CF5 significantly upregulated AMP
gene expression,
infection with strain PA14 did not.
Microarray analysis of AMP transcript levels following
infection with a PA14 avirulent isogenic mutant revealed
similar levels of expression as CF5, suggesting that the
ability to reduce Drosophila AMP expression is a
virulence trait of PA14 and likely other virulent P.
aeruginosa strains.

Although transcriptional profiling provides a large
amount of data, a subset of genes can be selected for
more in depth examination. For example, a follow-up
study examined the defense-specific genes that were non-
immunity related, in a bid to understand the suscept-
ibility to infection that occurs following trauma (282). It
was observed that skeletal muscle genes (SMGs) were
upregulated upon CF5 infection but not upon PA14
infection, suggesting that PA14 may suppress SMG
induction in response to infection. It was determined
that the JNK pathway is involved in the regulation of
SMGs, as the transcriptional profile of a JNK pathway
hypomorph infected with CF5 showed almost no induc-
tion of SMGs. Also, bacterial counts were higher in the
thoraces of the JNK hypomorph than the wildtype strain
but similar in the abdomens, suggesting that the JNK
pathway protects against P. aeruginosa infection by
promoting local tissue reconstruction after an infection.
Interestingly, this role for the JNK pathway in the local
defense against P. aeruginosa in tissue was conserved in a
mouse open wound trauma model.

RNAi analysis
RNAi has been used extensively to examine the Droso-
phila host response to microbial infection in recent years

due to the establishment of RNAi lines (47), dsRNA
libraries representing the majority of Drosophila genes
(283, 284), and well-developed, relatively easy methodol-
ogy for use with bacterial (259), fungal (59), and viral
pathogens (285).

The generation of over 22,000 transgenic Drosophila
RNAi lines representing 12,800 genes allow for the knock
down of host genes in specific tissues of the whole animal
(47). Thirteen thousand and fifty-three RNAi
lines
representing 78% of the genome were screened to identify
host factors that affected Drosophila survival after an
ingestion infection with S. marcescens (51). Eight hun-
dred and eighty-five lines with altered survival were
identified, of which 790 were susceptible (RNAi of the
genes increased susceptibility to killing by S. marcescens),
and 95 were resistant (RNAi of the genes decreased
susceptibility to killing by S. marcescens). Subsequent
RNAi screening of the genes in the Drosophila gut
epithelium identified 166 genes that affected Drosophila
survival, most notably JAK/STAT signaling pathway
components. Further study of the role of JAK/STAT
signaling revealed that the pathway negatively regulates
Drosophila survival
in response to a S. marcescens
infection, due to a disruption of intestinal cell home-
ostasis.

Drosophila S2 cells readily take up dsRNA added to
their culture medium, and use it to silence genes (286),
and the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center developed an
RNAi library representing 13,900 Drosophila genes (284).
This library has been used to perform genome-wide
screens in S2 cells that aimed to identify host factors
involved in infection by several pathogens (20, 165, 260
262). A smaller targeted RNAi library representing 7,216
Drosophila genes that are conserved in metazoans (283)
has been used to look specifically at host genes that may
be relevant during human infection (177, 287, 288).

Drosophila as a model for examining polymicrobe

host interactions
Some human infectious diseases like periodontitis and
cystic fibrosis are caused or exacerbated (in the case of
CF) by polymicrobial communities; however, there is a
dearth of in vivo models for studying the interactions
among these microbes and between the microbes and the
host. The polymicrobial community that colonizes the
cyctic fibrosis airway results in persistent inflammation
that ultimately destroys the lung, and P. aeruginosa is one
of the primary CF pathogens. A Drosophila natural
infection model was developed to examine the interaction
between P. aeruginosa and other oropharyngeal (OF)
species (including Streptococci, Neisseria, and Actino-
myces) isolated from cystic fibrosis patients (289). A
comparison of the survival of Drosophila infected with P.
aeruginosa alone, each of the 40 OF species alone, and a
combination of P. aeruginosa and the OF species

identified three classes of microbes. The virulent class
consisted of species that alone are able to kill Drosophila
and enhanced the killing of Drosophila in combination
with P. aeruginosa. The synergistic class represented
species that alone are not pathogenic to Drosophila but,
in combination with P. aeruginosa, significantly enhanced
Drosophila killing. The avirulent group represented
species that alone are not pathogenic to Drosophila and
do not enhance the killing of Drosophila in combination
with P. aeruginosa. A novel luminescence assay was used
to monitor the expression of individual P. aeruginosa
virulence genes in individual flies in real-time, during a
coinfection with representatives of the synergistic class of
OF species. P. aeruginosa virulence gene expression was
altered in the presence of these OF species with half of the
genes being upregulated, including several QS genes that
are responsive to the interspecies signaling molecule
autoinducer-2. This suggested that interspecies commu-
nication is important for modulating P. aeruginosa gene
expression in a mixed microbial infection.

Using AMP (diptericin, cecropin, and drosomycin)
expression as a readout for the immune response, three
different host responses to a coinfection with P. aerugi-
nosa and another OF species were observed: increased
AMP expression as a result of the additive effect of both
species, a suppression of AMP expression, and a syner-
gistic activation of AMP expression to levels greater than
would be achieved by the additive effect of both species.
It was hypothesized that
the
immune response seen in the third instance could be
detrimental to the animals. The results of this study
demonstrate the complexity of polymicrobial- and poly-
microbehost-interactions and the power of the Droso-
phila model for deciphering these interactions.

Drosophila as a model for drug therapy and
antibacterial screening
Drosophila provides the benefit of a whole animal context
for drug and antibacterial testing, although the model is
currently not as powerful as C. elegans for which high-
throughput techniques have been developed (290). Dro-
sophila can be used as an in vivo screen for antibiotics
against bacteria like S. aureus (254) and V. cholera (252).
Drosophila fed tetracycline or methicillin  which are used
clinically to treat S. aureus infections  resisted a S. aureus
infection that killed all flies fed a control sucrose solution
(254). V. cholera infection in a Drosophila natural infec-
tion model mimics human cholera, and when the
potassium ion channel blocker, clotrimazole, was co-
administered with the bacterium the flies were resistant to
the otherwise lethal infection (252).

Alternate antibacterial treatments such as phage ther-
apy have been tested using Drosophila and have shown
some promise. The lytic bacteriophage Caudovirales
strains MPK1 and MPK6 were isolated based on their

abilities to form plaques on lawns of P. aeruginosa (256).
These phage also killed P. aeruginosa grown in broth
culture, reducing the levels of the bacterium from 107 to
102 colony-forming units within 2 h. The efficacy of the
phage against a P. aeruginosa infection in vivo was
determined using a Drosophila septic injury model, and
it was observed that when the phage were fed to the
Drosophila, P. aeruginosa proliferation was inhibited and
fly survival was enhanced. The phages were also protec-
tive against a P. aeruginosa infection in a mouse
intraperitoneal model of infection.

D. melanogaster in oral microbiology

P. gingivalis

P. gingivalis is the first oral microbe that has been studied
using the D. melanogaster model. More importantly, it is
the first obligately anaerobic bacterium to be successfully
studied using the model (63), despite the inhospitable
oxygenated environment of the Drosophila hemolymph.
Using a septic injury route of infection, P. gingivalis
was pathogenic to Drosophila,
in a dose-dependent
manner, with an intermediate level of pathogenicity
between the non-pathogenic E. coil DH5-alpha and the
highly pathogenic P. aeruginosa PA01 (Fig. 2). A
comparison of clinically prevalent heteroduplex type
strains of P. gingivalis revealed that all of the strains
were virulent to some degree in Drosophila and that the
highly disease-associated type strain, W83, was also the
most pathogenic in the flies. P. gingivalis colony-forming
unit levels did not increase in the Drosophila; however, the
bacterium was able to persist in the flies up to 60 h
postinfection. The relatively low temperature at which the
infected flies were incubated (308C), in addition to the
oxygen rich environment of the hemolymph likely con-
tribute to the inability of P. gingivalis to multiply in the
host. However, P. gingivalis is aerotolerant and can
survive exposure to air for up to 5 h without any loss
in viability, which likely accounted for the bacterium’s
ability to persist
in the Drosophila postinfection. P.
gingivalis killing of Drosophila was not due to overt
destruction of the fly tissues or a high bacterial burden as
was observed with other pathogens, rather the observa-
tion that both live and heat-killed P. gingivalis effectively
killed Drosophila suggested that the pathology may be
due primarily to the host’s own exaggerated immune
response. Futher experiments are warranted to determine
the exact cause of death of P. gingivalis-infected
Drosophila, for example, in vivo RNAi could be used to
dampen Drosophila immune responses and assess whether
fly survival of P. gingivalis infection is enhanced as a
result.

Five P. gingivalis virulence gene mutants (arginine
gingipains, lysine gingipain, major fimbriae, minor fim-

The Drosophila melanogaster host model

briae, and capsule) that have been shown to be attenuated
in rodent models of infection were also attenuated in the
Drosophila model, demonstrating that P. gingivalis uses
similar mechanisms of virulence in Drosophila and in
mammals and that the bacterium’s killing of Drosophila is
multifactorial. It was hypothesized that as P. gingivalis
spreads systemically (FITC-labeled bacteria were ob-
served systemically using confocal microscopy), bacterial
surface-associated components induce a systemic hyper-
activation of the Drosophila immune response, which is
not only bad for the bacterium but also harmful to the
host.

To examine the Drosophila immune response to P.
gingivalis infection (178), six immune response compo-
nents were selected, and null mutants of these compo-
nents were screened for altered susceptibility to P.
gingvalis induced killing. Drosophila thiol-ester proteins,
Tep II, Tep IV, and the JNK pathway ligand, Eiger (TNF
homolog) were involved in the immune response against
P. gingivalis infection, while the scavenger receptors Eater
and Croquemort were dispensable for the response to P.
gingivalis infection. Interestingly, the Imd pathway was
initially found to be dispensable for the immune response
against P. gingivalis, and because the strain that was used
to infect the Drosophila (strain W83) is encapsulated, it
was reasoned that the capsule may nullify any Imd
pathway effects. This was supported by the observation
that an unencapsulated P. gingivalis strain, strain 381,
was significantly more pathogenic in Imd pathway-null
flies than in wildtype flies. In a subsequent experiment, P.
gingivalis strain W50UK, which is highly similar if not
identical to W83, behaved like strain W83, while its
isogenic capsule-null mutant, GPC, behaved like strain
381, when used to infect wildtype and Imd pathway-null
flies, confirming that the bacterial capsule was respon-
sible for the observed nullification of the Imd pathway.

To determine whether the P. gingivalis capsule pre-
vented the activation of the Imd pathway by shielding the
bacterium’s peptidoglycan from detection by PGRP-LC, a
dipt-LacZ reporter Drosophila strain was used to monitor
activation of the pathway in response to W50UK and
GPC infections. Beta galactosidase expression was de-
tected in both cases, which demonstrated that the capsule
of strain W50UK did not shield the bacterium’s PPG from
detection. To determine whether the P. gingivalis capsule
could protect the bacterium from killing by Imd pathway
regulated AMPs, the survival of strains W50UK and GPC
after exposure to cecropin A and drosocin was compared.
Strain GPC was significantly more susceptible to killing
by the AMPs than W50UK, which showed that the P.
gingivalis capsule mediates resistance to killing by Droso-
phila Imd-regulated AMPs. The results are also relevant to
humans as the capsule also protected W50UK from
killing by human beta-defensin-3. This was the first report

The future of the Drosophila model in the oral
microbiology arena
Although the use of the Drosophila model for the study of
oral microbiology is in its infancy, a wealth of informa-
tion about oral bacteriahost interactions can be gleaned
using this model. The major diseases of the oral cavity
(periodontitis and caries) are polymicrobial in nature,
and many putative periodontal (291293) and caries (294,
295) pathogens have been identified and are yet to be
characterized in terms of their interactions with the host.
The introduction of
the high-throughput Drosophila
model will facilitate the screening of these potential
pathogens, and the further characterization of species
that are found to be virulent, as is being done with
P. gingivalis. The Drosophila model is useful for studying
P. gingivalis because this bacterium is aerotolerant,
whereas a lot of oral bacteria will be killed by exposure
to even a small amount of air and are, thus, unlikely to
have virulent phenotypes in this model. Additional oral
species have been screened for virulence using the
Drosophila model, and a range of virulence has been
observed (unpublished).

Further characterization of oral bacteria that are found
to be pathogenic in the Drosophila model should involve
screening for pathogen virulence factors, as well as host
components that play a role in the response to infection.
A large number of P. gingivalis mutants with in vitro
phenotypes such as non-pigmentation, (296299), en-
hanced biofilm forming ability, and loss of capsule
synthesis (300) have been generated by transposon
mutagenesis; however, likely due to the impracticality of
using rodent models for large-scale screening, very few of
these mutants have been tested for changes in virulence in
vivo. The Drosophila model offers a high-throughput

option to perform large-scale screening of these mutants
to look for changes in virulence, which can then be
further characterized. Also, the small size of Drosophila
will make it relatively easy to profile its systemic response
to infection, say with P. gingivalis, in a whole animal
context, and could lead to the identification of novel host
components that interact with the bacterium. Interesting
candidates could be followed up on using null Drosophila
mutants and/or in vivo RNAi.

The mixed microbial nature of periodontitis and caries
warrants the study of polymicrobe interactions as well as
polymicrobehost interactions, and the work by Sibley
et al. (289) has laid the groundwork for the use of
Drosophila to study these interactions in vivo. Studies are
ongoing to examine the virulence of oral microbe
mixtures comprised of P. gingivalis and other oral species,
using Drosophila. The model could potentially be used to
examine mixtures of microbes that are even more
complex, possibly as complex as oral plaque.

Finally, Drosophila could potentially be used to test the
efficacy of antimicrobials against oral bacteria in a whole-
animal context; however, the model has not yet been
developed for high-throughput drug testing.

It is important to keep in mind that Drosophila is not a
natural host for oral microbes and that, due to anatomi-
cal and some host response  e.g. lack of an adaptive
immune response  differences, the model is not directly
comparable to humans. However, the large body of
evidence obtained from studies in which the model was
used to evaluate the hostmicrobe interplay has demon-
strated that many mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis
and the host response have been conserved between
mammals and Drosophila. It
the
addition of the Drosophila model to the repertoire of
tools with which to study oral microbiology will facilitate
infection research in this field considerably.
