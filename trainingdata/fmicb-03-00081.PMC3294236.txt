Fluctuating environmental conditions can promote diversity and control dominance in com-
munity composition. In addition to seasonal temperature and moisture changes, seasonal
supply of metabolic substrates selects populations temporally. Here we demonstrate cas-
cading effects in the supply of metabolic substrates on methanogenesis and community
composition of anaerobic methanogenic archaea in three contrasting peatlands in upstate
New York. Fresh samples of peat soils, collected about every 3 months for 20 months and
incubated at 22± 2˚C regardless of the in situ temperature, exhibited potential rates of
methane (CH4) production of 0.02–0.2 mmol L−1 day−1 [380–3800 nmol g−1 (dry) day−1).
The addition of acetate stimulated rates of CH4 production in a fen peatland soil, whereas
addition of hydrogen (H2), and simultaneous inhibition of H2-consuming acetogenic bacte-
ria with rifampicin, stimulated CH4 production in two acidic bog soils, especially, in autumn
and winter. The methanogenic community structure was characterized using T-RFLP analy-
ses of SSU rRNA genes. The E2 group of methanogens (Methanoregulaceae) dominated
in the two acidic bog peatlands with relatively greater abundance in winter. In the fen peat-
land, the E1 group (Methanoregulaceae) and members of the Methanosaetaceae were
co-dominant, with E1 having a high relative abundance in spring. Change in relative abun-
dance proﬁles among methanogenic groups in response to added metabolic substrates
was as predicted. The acetate-amendment increased abundance of Methanosarcinaceae,
and H2-amendment enhanced abundance of E2 group in all peat soils studied, respectively.
Additionally, addition of acetate increased abundance of Methanosaetaceae only in the bog
soils. Variation in the supply of metabolic substrates helps explain the moderate diversity
of methanogens in peatlands.

INTRODUCTION
The ecological literature has many examples in which ﬂuctuat-
ing environmental conditions promote diversity in community
composition (Chesson and Huntly, 1997). When temperature,
moisture, and resources ﬂuctuate, optimal conditions for a given
population will vary throughout the year, and thus community
dominance varies accordingly. For microorganisms, there are two
mechanisms. One is dispersal from a larger source that facilitates
immigration and rise in dominance when optimal environmen-
tal conditions occur. This is called the mass-effect (Mouquet and
Loreau, 2002) in the ecological literature. The other mechanism is
called species-sorting (Leibold, 1998) in which all members of the
local community are present throughout the year, but their tempo-
ral niche varies in response to optimal conditions. Understanding
mechanisms that control regional and local composition of micro-
bial communities is imperative in light of on-going environmental
changes.

In boreal and cool temperate peatlands, for example, microor-
ganisms are subjected to long, cold winters and short summers
with more permissive growing conditions. Microbial activity in
summer in response to warm temperatures is not surprising.

However, activity after the growing season beneﬁts from input
of senescent plant tissue that provides energy and nutrients, and
microbial activity in soils in wintertime is well established (cf.,
McMahon et al., 2011). Therefore, the question is whether a sea-
sonal supply of metabolic substrates is strong enough to control
diversity in a microbial community (cf., Hiltunen et al., 2008).

Here we are particularly interested in saturated organic soils
that provide habitat for anaerobic microorganisms. For exam-
ple, CH4-producing methanogens are obligate anaerobes in
the Euryarchaeota that produce CH4 from a limited number
of substrates: acetate (aceticlastic methanogenesis), CO2 + H2

(hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis), formate, methanol, and a
few methylamines (Zinder, 1993). Therefore, methanogens rely on
other microorganisms that decompose organic matter to supply
methanogenic substrates (Drake et al., 2009). In general decom-
posers in peatlands feed on two sources of organic matter. One
source is associated with plant roots; either root litter, or soluble
organic molecules exuded from roots to soil (Williams and Yavitt,
2010). Root-associated microbial activity should peak during the
growing season in response to root activity. Leaf litter is the other
source of soil organic matter. In this case, input of leaf litter to

soil occurs at the end of the growing season, and thus we expect
maximum activity after the peak in soil temperature.

Fresh organic matter from high plant production is thought to
fuel aceticlastic methanogenesis rather than the hydrogenotrophic
pathway (Kotsyurbenko, 2010). In contrast, hydrogenotrophic
pathway dominates in less productive peatlands and in those dom-
inated by Sphagnum mosses and heath shrubs (Galand et al.,
2005; Keller and Bridgham, 2007). Therefore, the aceticlastic path-
way should be more prevalent in the summer and autumn with
input of the freshest plant material. In this regard, Yavitt et al.
(1988) found maximal rates of CH4 production in peat sam-
ples from early spring and late autumn when measurements were
made at a standard temperature of 20˚C regardless of in situ peat
temperature. Juottonen et al. (2008) found that CH4 produc-
tion peaked in February when the supply of metabolic substrates
peaked, whereas the diversity of methanogens varied only slightly
throughout the year.

Here we examine rates of CH4 production in relation to the
diversity and dynamics of methanogens in three peatlands with
contrasting characteristics: McLean Bog, Chicago Bog, and Michi-
gan Hollow (local names). McLean and Chicago are both acidic
peat bogs (pH 3–4), whereas Michigan Hollow is a minerotrophic
fen (pH 6–7). We added substrates to peat in short-term incuba-
tions of peat soil to examine substrate limitation of methanogen-
esis and also examine inducible shifts in populations in response
to substrates. The three peatlands are isolated from each other and
surrounded by a matrix of forest and agricultural land. Although
dispersal of anaerobes occurs across inhospitable habitats (Yavitt
et al., 2011), we found evidence for species-sorting and high diver-
sity of the local community. Therefore, if climate changes in the
future, the impact on peat CH4 production and methanogens is
more complicated than simple temperature control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITES
The three sites were located within 40 km of Ithaca, NY, USA
(42˚26
W). The region is characterized by kettle-kame
topography formed during Wisconsin Age glaciation (McNamara
et al., 1992). This part of the Appalachian upland consists of rel-
atively un-deformed sedimentary rocks of Ordovician, Silurian,
and Devonian age that dip southward less than 1˚. The upper-
most bedrock is upper Devonian shale and thin-bedded sand-
stone. Above this is glacial-ﬂuvial stratiﬁed sand and gravel with
a strongly calcareous matrix. Parts of the landscape are covered
by 5–12 m thick glacial till. Mean annual precipitation is 932 mm,
and mean annual temperature is 7.8˚C. Precipitation was above
average, 125% of normal, during the ﬁrst 6 months of the study
period (June to December 2004), whereas as it was closer to the
average, 109% of normal, after that (January 2005 to February
2006).

Sedge-derived peat accumulated initially until it was above the
local water table, at which point Sphagnum-derived bog peat accu-
mulated. Total peat depth is about 6.5 m. The bog has a ground
cover of Sphagnum fuscum on elevated hummocks and S. magel-
lenicum on recessed hollows. The drier hummocks also support
the ericaceous shrub Chamaedaphne calyculata (leatherleaf). Peat

Total peat depth is 8 m. Sphagnum species include S. angustifolium
and S. amgellanicum. Shrubs include C. calyculata and Vaccinium

natum (cotton sedge) also is common. Peat soil pH is 3.4–4.3 at
15 cm depth. Water table level is above the peat surface following
snowmelt in spring, and it declines to about 25 cm below the peat
surface by mid-summer. Further site description is given in Osvald
(1970).

nated by a single species of sedge, Carex lacustris (lake sedge) with
patches of Typha latifolia (Common cattail) and Lythrum salicaria
(Purple loosestrife). The maximum peat depth is about 1.2 m,
consisting mostly of Carex sedge-derived peat. Peat soil pH is 6.7
at 15 cm depth. Water table level ﬂuctuates about 10 cm between
spring snowmelt and summer in this site. Further site description
is given in Bernard and Macdonald (1974).

PEAT SOIL COLLECTION
We obtained fresh soil samples on each sampling date by cutting
through surface vegetation and peat soil to a depth roughly below
the lowest water table level seasonally: about 10 cm deep in Chicago
bog, 20 cm deep in Mclean bog, and 20 cm deep in Michigan Hol-
low. We assume this depth has the largest rate of methanogenesis
because it is saturated throughout the study period. This assump-
tion has been conﬁrmed in previous studies at McLean Bog and
Chicago Bog using samples collected in 2004 (Brauer, 2006).

For each collection, three separate portions of peat soil from
5 cm below the water table were collected directly into glass can-
ning jars. Jars were sealed with an airtight lid while immersed in
the peat to prevent O2 exposure to the sampled peat soil. The jars
were taken within 2 h of sapling to the laboratory and placed in
an anaerobic glove box (Coy Laboratory Products). Fresh sam-
ples were collected at 2–4 month intervals for a 12-month period
between June 2004 and July 2005. We also collected small sam-
ples in November 2005 and in February 2006 when the peatland
surface was partially frozen: these samples were used for analy-
sis of community composition but not in vitro incubation for
methanogenesis. Overall, the study lasted 20 months.

SOIL INCUBATIONS
We followed methods described in Bräuer et al. (2004). Brieﬂy,
inside the anaerobic glove box one gram of peat (wet mass) and
9 mL of anaerobic de-ionized water was placed in 18× 150 mm
crimp-top tube (Bellco Glass Co.,Vineland, NJ, USA). After crimp-
ing the tops, the tubes were ﬂushed for 5 min with sterile O2-
scrubbed N2/CO2 (70/30%). Four treatments were established in
triplicate for soil from each site and for each sampling period.
Final concentrations for each treatment was: (1) no additions, (2)
−1), and sterile
sodium acetate (1 mM), (3) rifampicin (10 mg L
−1). The
O2-scrubbed H2/CO2 (80/20%) plus rifampicin (10 mg L
purpose of rifampicin was to inhibit acetogenic bacteria, carry-
ing out the reaction 4H2 + 2CO2 → CH3COOH+ 2H2O, which
compete with H2-utilizing methanogens. Accumulation of acetic
acid can acidify peat, which interferes with our ability to examine

the effect of various environmental parameters on the presence of
H2/CO2-utilizing methanogens in the peat. Rifampicin treatment
is explained fully in Bräuer et al. (2004).
Tubes were incubated in the dark at 22± 2˚C. Tubes with no
additions and sodium acetate were incubated without shaking,
whereas tubes with H2/CO2 were shaken to help mix gases between
peat soil and headspace. Methane concentrations in each tube
were determined at 2–3 day intervals by gas chromatography as in
Bräuer et al. (2004). All of the samples exhibited a delay before
the onset of increasing CH4 concentration. We report the length
of the delay period before onset of CH4 production (in days) in
order to distinguish from a true lag phase in microbial growth.
Rates of potential CH4 production were determined from the lin-
ear increase in CH4 concentration for about 14 days following the
onset of CH4 production. Rates of potential CH4 production are
expressed as millimoles of CH4 produced per liter of wet peat
soil per day. We recognize that rates are often expressed per gram
of dry soil, which is standard in soil science since the wet mass
of soil varies depending on soil moisture content. However, peat
below the water table is essentially saturated, and thus volume
is the correct unit. Moreover, volume is the convention in litera-
ture for aqueous systems and by microbiologists studying cultures.
For comparison among units, the peat bulk density values are:
0.076± 0.024 (SD) Mg m
−3 for McLean; 0.084± 0.022 Mg m
−3
for Chicago; and, 0.105± 0.018 Mg m
−3 for Michigan Hollow. We
also determined pH values per sample.

SSU rRNA GENE ANALYSIS
DNA was extracted from duplicate 0.5-g portions of fresh peat
from each of the triplicate samples incubated per sites per sampling
date. Brieﬂy, DNA was extracted with the Power Soil™DNA kit
(MoBio) using manufacturer’s protocol, with some changes. After
adding the C1 solution, 50 μL of a sterile 200 mM AlNH4(SO4)2
solution was added to decrease the amount of humic acid conta-
mination. The solution was put in a bead beater (MiniBeadbeater)
for 80 s set on “homogenize.” Quality of DNA was checked with
agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometer readings.

Hales et al., 1996). These primers target methanogens, although
other archaeal groups may also be ampliﬁed. The 1100 reverse
primer was labeled on its 5
-/6-
FAM). The PCR mixture (35 μL for each reaction) contained the
following components per μL: 1× Taq buffer with 1.5 mM MgCl2
(Eppendorf, USA), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.25 μM forward and reverse
primers, 1.2 U of Taq Polymerase (Eppendorf), 0.2 μg BSA and
0.1–0.3 ng of extracted DNA. The PCR thermal cycler conditions
are described by Hales et al. (1996), with 25 cycles. PCR prod-
ucts were examined by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose for size
veriﬁcation (1100 bp).

The PCR was performed three times, and 30 μL from each
run was pooled to achieve enough PCR product from the same
sample using a low number of cycles and to prevent the proba-
bility of random PCR artifacts due to location on a thermocycler
surface, pipetting, etc. (Although we did not rerun every sample
systematically, random samples were redone and nearly identical
relative composition of community composition from the same

sample supports our conﬁdence in T-RFLP reproducibility.) The
ﬁnal product was puriﬁed with Quick Step™2 PCR Puriﬁcation
Kit (Edge Biosystems). Then 70 ng of puriﬁed PCR products were
digested with a mix of HhaI (15 U) and Sau96I (10 U) enzymes
(New England Biolabs for 3 h at 37˚C. Digested DNA was puri-
ﬁed with the Performa® DTRV3 96-Well Short Plate Kit (Edge
Biosystems) and concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge. The dehy-
drated products were then re-suspended with a mix of Hi Di-
Formamide (volume μL/mL; Applied Biosystems) and Gene Scan
500-Liz marker (12 μL/mL; Applied Biosystems) to a ﬁnal volume
of 15 μL. Fragments were resolved with an Applied BioSystems
3730xl DNA Analyzer (BRC, Cornell University).

T-RF sequence length, peak height, and area were analyzed
using the GeneScan Analysis Software (Applied Biosystems, 2000).
The raw data used to image these T-RFLP results on an electro-
pherogram was exported in order to standardize the proﬁle for
each sample. With a Java program (Culman et al., 2009), the
relative ﬂuorescent units (RFU) of peaks with sizes between 50
and 500 bp were combined by height and normalized to 100 total
RFU units. The standardization allowed the comparison of relative
abundances from sample to sample.

We used T-RFLP analysis to obtain a description of the dom-
inant groups in the archaeal community accessible through our
primer set. The 1Af-1100R primers have been thoroughly tested
previously in T-RFLP analysis with minimal ambiguous iden-
tiﬁcation. The T-RFLP protocol, using two restriction enzymes
(HhaI and Sau96I), was designed by performing multiple in silico
sequence analyses of published sequences and clone libraries, and
conﬁrming the predicted fragment size by amplifying and T-RFLP
analysis clones. Cadillo-Quiroz et al. (2006) presents the identity
match and predicted terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) size
from the in silico digestion.

The T-RFLP analysis was repeated on peat soils following
in vitro incubation for CH4 production potential. The analy-
sis was performed 35 days after incubation for soils treated with
rifampicin and rifampicin plus H2, and 70 days after incubation
for the un-amended soils and for those treated with acetate.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Values presented below are mean (N = 3). We analyzed seasonal
differences in methanogenesis and community composition using
analysis of variance (ANOVA). The T-RFLP values were square
root-transformed before analysis, whereas rates of potential CH4
production were log-transformed.

RESULTS
RATES OF POTENTIAL CH4 PRODUCTION
All of the peat soil samples exhibited a delay between the time we
initiated incubation and the onset of CH4 production (Table 1).
There was no consistent seasonal pattern in delay time (P > 0.05
for sampling date); however, the average delay time was shorter
for peat soil from Michigan Hollow (9 days) than from Chicago
(11 days) and McLean (14 days). For each of the three sites, rates
of potential CH4 production (measured at a consistent incubation
temperature of 21˚C) varied 3- to 5-fold among sampling dates.
In general, the slowest rates occurred for soil collected in October
from Chicago and Michigan Hollow versus April for soil from

McLean. The fastest rates occurred for samples collect in July for
all three sites (Table 2).

Rates of potential CH4 production in peat soils from the three
sites exhibited some degree of substrate limitation among sam-
pling dates (Table 3). The addition of acetate to peat soils from
Chicago and McLean increased rates by 30% to nearly 4-fold, with
slightly greater response for McLean than for Chicago, in partic-
ular, for soil collected in October. Added acetate had the largest
effect on peat soil from Michigan Hollow. Notably, the addition
of rifampicin often decreased rates of potential CH4 production
by as much as 60%. However, the addition of rifampicin+ H2
stimulated potential CH4 production, especially, in January for
peat from Chicago and October for McLean.

METHANOGEN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
The labeling of the 1Af-1100R primer set combined with a dou-
ble digestion with the HhaI/Sau96I restriction enzymes resolved
most of the euryarchaeal groups in which each T-RF could be
associated with a single group. This was conﬁrmed by digestion of
multiple clones and pure cultures as given in Cadillo-Quiroz et al.
(2006), including Methanosarcinaceae (MS), Methanosaetaceae
(MT), and Methanobacteriaceae (MB), as well as recently cultured
(cid:2)
groups, such as group E2
(E1) in the order
Methanomicrobiales, and rice cluster-I (RC-I) in the novel order
Methanocellales. We also identiﬁed fragments associated with as
yet uncultured euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal groups, including
RC-II, group 1.3b and 1.1c.

We rely on PCR and T-RFLP analysis because our primary goal
was presence or absence of different methanogen groups at differ-
ent times of the year. We realize that qPCR is necessary for accurate
assessment of abundance. Notwithstanding, the dominant group
in peat soil from McLean was E2 (Figure 1). The relative abun-
dance of E2 changed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01 for sampling date)
during the study period, with relatively greater abundance in the
coldest months versus less abundance in June and July. Similarly,
the MS group had greater abundance (P < 0.01 for sampling date)
in colder than in warmer months, with E1 having slightly higher
relative abundance in those months. The E2 group also was the
dominant group in peat soil from Chicago with proportionally
greater abundance in coldest months. However in contrast to
McLean, the MS group had greater abundance in warmer than
in colder months in Chicago (P < 0.01 for sampling date).

In peat soil from Michigan Hollow, MT and E1 were the dom-
inant groups. The relative abundance of E1 is greatest in May,
whereas MT were the dominant group in other sampling times
(P < 0.01 for sampling date). The group E2 was in Michigan Hol-
low only once in August. Overall, there were signiﬁcant differences
in the abundance of phylogenetic groups among the three sites.
Relative abundance of MT (P < 0.001 for site), E2 (P < 0.001 for
site), MS (P < 0.01 for site), and E1 (P < 0.01 for site) are all highly
signiﬁcantly different in all sites, with a corrected P level of 0.0028.
The addition of substrates changed the relative abundance of
methanogenic groups in predictable ways (Figure 2). In peat from
Mclean and Chicago, for instance, the addition of acetate led to
increase relative abundance of MS and MT at the expense of
E1 and E2. With added rifampicin, E1, MS, and E2 were domi-
nant, whereas added rifampicin plus H2 led to almost 100% E2. In
contrast, in peat soil from Michigan Hollow, E1 and MT had sub-
stantial presence in all treatments, with MS increasing with added
acetate versus E2 increasing with added rifampicin and H2.

DISCUSSION
RATES OF POTENTIAL CH4 PRODUCTION
In this study we incubated samples of peat soil at one temperature
regardless of the in situ temperature on the date of soil collec-
tion. Our rationale for one temperature follows the well-known
phenomenon that low temperatures, <12˚C, constrain rates of
CH4 production in peat soils (Yavitt et al., 1988; Juottonen
et al., 2008). Therefore, measuring very low production rates in

the other two sites. The larger CH4 production potential in soil
−1) versus that at McLean
from Chicago (0.059 mmol L
−1) is notable. Chicago is a relatively dry peat-
(0.031 μmol L
land with water table 20 cm below the surface, whereas McLean
is a relatively wet peatland in which the water table is closer to
the surface. In addition, Chicago has a fen-to-bog transition about
0.6-m below the peatland surface, whereas fen peat is buried much
deeper in McLean. We deduce that fen peat provides nutrients for
microbial growth (Dettling et al., 2007) and reduces the delay time
before the onset of methanogenesis, despite the drier condition in
Chicago than in McLean.

Methanogenesis in soil cannot be measured directly in the ﬁeld
very easily, but rather we must rely on measurements made in vitro.
Therefore, rates of potential CH4 production depend upon soil
collection and storage as well as procedures used in the labora-
tory. For example, although methanogens are obligate anaerobes,
some strains can tolerate short-term exposure to O2 (Jarrell, 1985),
whereas others cannot. Consumption of methanogenic substrates
can occur during storage and delay onset of CH4 production. Here
we collect peat soil just below the water table level, which should
have the greatest rate of CH4 production within the depth proﬁle
(Sundh et al., 1994). Also, we had minimal storage of soil samples
between collection and incubation (<2 days), and we prepared all
of the incubations in an anaerobic glove box to prevent exposure to
O2. Nevertheless, every soil sample exhibited a delay phase before
the onset of CH4 production.

A delay implies either a small population size of methanogens,
methanogenesis inhibited by another anaerobic process, or by the
lack of methanogenic substrates. Although these peat soils con-
tain a relatively large viable population of methanogens (Cadillo-
Quiroz et al., 2006), we suspect that a delay results from the high
in vitro dilution that reduced effective population size. We cannot
rule out that the delay also was a period of low activity per cell,
as methanogens are known to vary activity per cell during incu-
bation (Krüger et al., 2005). Regardless, there was no signiﬁcant
seasonal pattern in the length of the delay period, suggesting the
local condition just prior to sampling can inﬂuence delay time.

The fastest rates of potential CH4 production in all three sites
occurred in July. This coincides with maximum plant growth,
which suggests that plant root activity, and organic compounds
released from plant roots fuels the greatest CH4 production poten-
tial. This might be true at Mclean, which showed a low rate outside
the growing season, presumably supplemented by root-derived
compounds in the growing season. Moreover, some of the plants
may harbor distinct subsets of methanogens, i.e., different from
those in the bulk peat, as was found in McLean Bog (Cadillo-
Quiroz et al., 2010). However, at Chicago, a moderate high CH4
production potential in January may possibly indicate that root
activity is less inﬂuential, or perhaps indicates that signiﬁcant root
activity is present in January, due to the abundance of evergreen
shrubs. In contrast, although grasses dominate the vegetation at
Michigan Hollow, and grass roots are known to release organic
compounds, methanogenic activity utilizes dead plant material
throughout the year in Michigan Hollow (Williams and Yavitt,
2010).

Few studies have addressed year-round patterns in CH4 pro-
duction in soils, independent of in situ temperature regime

(although see Yavitt et al., 1988). One such study is by Juottonen
et al. (2008) that reported maximum CH4 production potential
in samples of peat soils collected in winter from a boreal fen. The
explanation was that low temperatures in late autumn and winter
constrained CH4 production to a greater degree than hydrolysis
and fermentation, thereby allowing methanogenic substrates to
accumulate. When the cold temperature limitation was relaxed in
the laboratory, rates of methanogenic activity responded. How-
ever, our sites occur in a temperate climate, and cold wintertime
temperatures occur for no more than 4 months. For example,
during our study soil temperature was 20–25˚C in October, 4˚C
in December, and it had rebounded to 10˚C by March. There-
fore, low rates of potential CH4 production that we observed in
September/October are notable because in situ temperature was
permissible, which suggests a substrate limitation or competition
with other anaerobic bacteria.

Some studies have suggested that substrate availability does not
limit anaerobic activity because substrates exuded from plant roots
fuel activity during the growing season, whereas anaerobes decom-
pose dead plant material in the fall and wintertime (Lipson et al.,
2002). Although plant roots do release organic compounds to soil,
anaerobic metabolism in plants produces only ethanol and/or lac-
tate (Good and Muench, 1993), neither of which are methanogenic
substrates. However, the oxidation of these compounds produces
acetate, so aceticlastic methanogenesis could be linked indirectly
to plant root activity. However, added acetate had the greatest
impact on CH4 production in August through October, which is
after maximum root growth. The larger impact in Michigan Hol-
low than in the other two sites is consistent with grass derived
organic matter, which decomposes more readily than moss or
shrub litter and supports aceticlastic methanogens. This is sup-
ported by an increase in abundance of fragment lengths afﬁliated
with Methanosaeta spp., known acetate-utilizing methanogens.
It is logical that stimulation with acetate would produce higher
rates of CH4 production. In contrast, the greater response to
added H2 + rifampicin in Chicago and McLean is consistent with

the methanogenic community dominated by E2, which is an
H2-utilizing methanogen.

The stimulation of CH4 production by added methanogenic
substrates suggests a competition for substrates with other anaer-
obic pathways. For example both acetate and H2 are utilized by
anaerobes that carry our respiration with electron acceptors other
than O2. However, in other studies we have shown that the addition
of electron acceptors, such as ferric iron (Fe3+
) and sulfate did not
inhibit methanogenesis completely (Dettling et al., 2006). Indeed,
in some cases, the addition of Fe3+
stimulated CH4 production,
suggesting that iron is an essential nutrient of methanogens, and it
is short supply, which is not surprising in these relatively nutrient
poor soils. Thus what processes compete with methanogens for
available acetate and H2 is still not clear.

METHANOGENIC COMMUNITY
Previous work with methanogens in peat soils, in particular those
studies based on SSU rRNA gene sequences, has suggested that
community composition can be quite diverse (cf., Basiliko et al.,
2003; Juottonen et al., 2008; Kotsyurbenko, 2010; Yavitt et al.,
2011). It is well-known, however, that SSU rRNA genes target

total community composition, including active and inactive cells
(Logue and Lindström, 2010), and thus the approach has been
criticized for having a biased estimate of community diversity.
Notwithstanding, inactive cells at the time of soil sampling can
become active during other times of the year in response to opti-
mal environmental conditions (Lennon and Jones, 2011), resulting
in a temporal niche (Loreau, 1989). Indeed, the second part of our
study (see below) with in vitro incubations of portions of peat soil
provides a unique opportunity to examine the temporal niche via
species-sorting for methanogens in isolated peatlands.

The prevalence of E2 in McLean and Chicago is consistent with
the evidence that H2-utilizing methanogens, especially members
of Methanomicrobiales dominate in acidic peat soils (Galand et al.,
2005; Yavitt et al., 2011). The small fraction of RC-I agrees with
the notion that RC-I prefers substrate-rich habitats, such as root
surfaces (Cadillo-Quiroz et al., 2010). In contrast, the E2 group
appears to be adapted to low-nutrient environments, such as the
bulk peat and pore water of acidic bogs. In fact, the ﬁrst strain of
this group,“Candidatus Methanoregula boonei,” was isolated using
a low-nutrient low-ionic-strength medium (Bräuer et al., 2006).
Therefore, the relative dominance of E2 in both bog sites is not
surprising.

The peak in relatively dominance of E2 in January in McLean
versus in June in Chicago might imply no consistent seasonal
pattern in relative dominance of E2 in acidic bogs. However,
peak dominance in both sites correlated with a relatively small

impact of added H2 (+rifampicin) on potential CH4 production

(Table 3). The small impact suggests an adequate supply of sub-
strates for methanogenesis, and thus E2 might assume a greater
role when metabolic substrates are plentiful. When the relative
proportion of E2 did decrease in both sites, the difference was
due mostly to an increase in the proportion of E1. The E1 group
also relies on H2/CO2 for CH4 production (Cadillo-Quiroz et al.,
2008). However, more experimental studies are needed to verify
whether E1 favors substrate-limited conditions, whereas E2 favors
substrate-rich conditions.

The prevalence of MT in Michigan Hollow is consistent with the
evidence that acetate-utilizing methanogens dominate in neutral,
sedge-dominated fens (Galand et al., 2005). All known mem-
bers of MT make CH4 by splitting acetate (Liu and Whitman,
2008). Moreover, they do so at concentrations of acetate as low
as 5–70 μM (Jetten et al., 1992), suggesting that low concen-
trations of acetate occur in peat pore water in Michigan Hol-
low. Moreover, MT is able to outcompete MS at low acetate

concentrations (Galand et al., 2005). Thus, ﬁnding MS and RC-
I in all three sites is interesting because they have been shown
to rely on relatively large substrate concentrations for CH4 pro-
duction: MS at acetate concentrations between 0.2 and 1.2 mM
(Jetten et al., 1992); and, RC-I at high H2 concentrations (Conrad
et al., 2006). Indeed, our studies in other peatlands have shown
the co-occurrence of MS and RC-I, associated with high substrate
conditions (Yavitt et al., 2007). Although MS can make CH4 from
H2/CO2, we did ﬁnd that in vitro incubations of peat soil with
added acetate led to a large increase in MS dominance, which
suggests that, at least, some of the in situ members ﬁnd high
acetate concentrations in order to make CH4. Interestingly, the E1
group increased relative dominance in the springtime in Michigan
Hollow, whereas MT decreased in abundance at the same time.
Thus, the springtime appears to be a time of increased acetate
supply, favoring MS over MT, with low H2 or formate for E2
growth.

Species-sorting is suggested by change in relative dominance
of methanogen groups following addition of metabolic substrates
to portions of peat soil maintained in the laboratory. This was
demonstrated most impressively by the increase in E2 in peat
soil from Michigan Hollow, going from <1% relative dominance
in situ to 45% relative dominance following in vitro incubation
with added H2+ rifampicin. Likewise added acetate led to large

increase in relative dominance of MS and MT in peat from the
two acidic bogs. Hence experiments in the laboratory can provide
insight into hidden microbial diversity in situ (cf., Meier et al.,
2008). Our data collectively shows that these peatlands harbor
diverse populations of methanogens even though not all popu-
lations are active continuously. Rather we suggest that the avail-
ability of substrates is an important cue for population growth.
This extends the species-sorting concept to isolated peatlands,
as demonstrated for bacterial communities in isolated lakes (cf.,
Jones and McMahon, 2008). This does not rule out the mass-
effect and dispersal for peatland methanogens (cf., Yavitt et al.,
2011), but species-sorting might be an important mechanism for
maintaining diversity on a seasonal basis.

Now, we need to know how substrate supply varies temporally
in peatlands. Control on variation in substrate supply adds another
dimension to global environmental change (Trumbore, 1997). For
example, we need to know whether temperature and moisture
regimes alone are the controlling mechanism, or whether more
complex controls exist, such as via plant community composition
(Hiltunen et al., 2008; Williams and Yavitt, 2010).
