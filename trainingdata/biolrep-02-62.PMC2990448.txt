Abstract
In collaboration or competition with many other actin-binding proteins, the actin-depolymerizing
factor/cofilins integrate transmembrane signals to coordinate the spatial and temporal organization of
actin filament assembly/disassembly (dynamics).
In addition, newly discovered effects of these
proteins in lipid metabolism, gene regulation, and apoptosis suggest that their roles go well beyond
regulating the cytoskeleton.

Introduction and context
All eukaryotes express at
the
essential actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin
family of actin-binding proteins [1]. Three forms are
expressed in mammals: ADF (also known as destrin);
cofilin-1, the major ubiquitous form in non-muscle
tissue; and cofilin-2, the major form in differentiated
muscle. In vitro, ADF and cofilin-1 are qualitatively
similar in many of their actin-dynamizing activities and
regulation but differ quantitatively. ADF has a weaker
nucleating ability than cofilin and thus can serve as a
monomer-sequestering protein for ATP-actin at concen-
trations in which cofilin would enhance assembly of the
cofilin-ATP-actin complex [2,3]. However, at the physio-
logical molar ratios to actin (generally 1:25 to 1:4), both
ADF and cofilin bind ADP subunits in filamentous actin
(F-actin) and sever filaments, leading to enhanced actin
dynamics [2]. Silencing and rescue experiments of ADF
and cofilin in cultured cells show that either protein can
rescue defects in cytokinesis and cell motility [4],
although there are suggestions in the literature that the
two proteins differ in their ability to regulate cell
migration in three-dimensional matrices, with ADF
being the more important protein for cell
invasion
through Matrigel [5]. Knockout of the cofilin-1 gene in
mice is embryonic lethal [6], whereas the only gross
deficit in ADF knockout mice is postnatal blindness due
to corneal thickening at about 4 weeks [7]. Because

cofilin-1, the most ubiquitous of the isoforms, is usually
expressed at higher levels and has been studied more
intensely because of its essential role in development,
this review will focus on cofilin-1, hereafter just called
cofilin.

Major recent advances
Mechanism and function in actin dynamics
Cofilin is best known as a regulator of actin filament
non-equilibrium assembly/disassembly. Whether cofi-
lin promotes actin assembly or disassembly depends
upon the concentration of cofilin relative to actin and
the relative concentrations of other actin-binding
proteins [1,8]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that
if the ratio of cofilin/actin subunits in a filament is low
(less than 1%),
filament
severing (Figure 1) [8]. At higher cofilin/actin molar
ratios (1:10 to 1:2), cofilin severs rapidly but tran-
siently because it binds F-actin cooperatively and
stabilizes F-actin in a twisted form as it saturates the
severed pieces. Indeed, the assembly of the cofilin-
ADP-actin complex into non-dynamic actin bundles
(also called rods) is an important energy-conserving
mechanism that
in most cells is readily reversible
(Figure 1); however, in axons and dendrites of stressed
neurons, the rods block transport and cause loss of
synapses [9], perhaps contributing to dementias,
including Alzheimer disease [10].

Figure 1. Concentration-dependent effects of cofilin on actin dynamics

(a) Cofilin (purple) binds preferentially to ADP-actin (orange) and, at low stoichiometry with respect to actin subunits, severs filaments, creating new barbed
and pointed ends. The cofilin dissociates with an actin subunit in the ADP form, and nucleotide exchange, enhanced by Srv2/CAP1 (exchange factor for actin-
bound nucleotide when complexed to cofilin) and/or profilin (green), occurs on the actin. Cofilin can recycle to sever again. The pieces of filamentous actin
(F-actin) generated can nucleate filament growth or can enhance depolymerization if assembly-competent ATP-actin is limiting. (b) At higher stoichiometry,
cofilin binds to ADP-actin, but since binding is cooperative, regions of the F-actin become saturated and stabilized in the ‘twisted form’. Severing occurs
rapidly, but as the cofilin is sequestered on the pieces of actin, severing is not persistent. Fragments are further depolymerized in the presence of actin-
interacting protein 1 (Aip1) (blue) to generate monomer or can be used to nucleate growth. In cells under stress where ADP-actin levels are elevated, the
cofilin-saturated F-actin assembles into rod-shaped bundles.

Other actin-binding proteins may enhance, modulate, or
eliminate cofilin effects on actin dynamics. Among the
best studied of these are actin-interacting protein 1
(Aip1) (also known as WDR1), tropomyosins, cortactin,
actin-related protein 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex, cor-
onins, and Srv2/CAP1 (exchange factor for actin-bound
nucleotide when complexed to cofilin). Aip1 binds to
cofilin-actin filaments and enhances the severing and
depolymerizing activity of cofilin, potentiating the
generation of actin monomers [11]. Some of the more
than 40 mammalian tropomyosin isoforms have an
F-actin-stabilizing function, in which they compete with
cofilin for F-actin binding. Surprisingly, however, certain
tropomyosin isoforms may enhance cofilin recruitment
and F-actin turnover [12].

Cortactin has its highest binding affinity to F-actin
subunits containing ATP or ADP-Pi,
thus protecting
newly added subunits, whereas cofilin has its highest
affinity for ADP-actin subunits, which accumulate in the
more aged region of the filament. Because cofilin binding
to F-actin enhances Pi (inorganic phosphate) release from
neighboring subunits [13] and cortactin binding resists
this, the balanced effect of cofilin and cortactin helps
maintain the filament network and its dynamics at the
leading edge of a migrating cell [14]. Cortactin is also an
activator of the Arp2/3 complex, a seven-protein complex
that binds along pre-existing filaments to nucleate new
filament growth or capture filament pointed ends,
creating 70° branch points. These branches provide the
numerous filament barbed ends,
the sites for actin
assembly that drive membrane protrusion during polar-
ized cell migration. In addition to cortactin, several
proteins activated by transmembrane signaling, including
neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp),
have the ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex. In the
highly specialized invadopodium compartment of meta-
static cells, cofilin binds cortactin in a complex with Arp2/
3, along with the Arp2/3 activator N-WASp and the N-
WASp activator Nck1 (adaptor molecule with src homol-
ogy domains 2 and 3) [15]. Cofilin is released for the
essential function of severing after phosphorylation of a
cortactin tyrosine [16]. Furthermore, as demonstrated
only in vitro, cofilin can debranch the Arp2/3 complex by
direct
interaction [17], again suggesting that cofilin
activity must be tightly regulated both spatially and
temporally. In fact, the relationship between cofilin level
and cell migration is biphasic [18]. A moderate increase in
cofilin accelerates cell migration, clearly a factor in
metastasis, but greater increases reverse this effect. Cofilin
and its upstream regulators are essential to the develop-
ment of cell polarity and to the maintenance of polarized
cell motility [19-21].

Another leading-edge protein is coronin 1 (Crn1), which
has three domains: an N-terminal b propeller domain that
binds F-actin, a middle domain, and a C-terminal coiled-
coil (CC) domain that modulates the Arp2/3 complex
[22]. The b propeller and CC domains are involved in
opposing effects on cofilin/actin interaction. Which effect
prevails depends upon the nucleotide bound to actin [23].
The CC domain competes with cofilin in binding to ATP/
ADP-Pi-actin, thus reducing the already weak binding of
cofilin to this region of F-actin. In filament regions rich in
ADP-actin, the b propeller domain synergizes cofilin
severing. When the dominant inhibitory effects of the CC
domain are negated by phosphorylation, Crn1 can switch
from its filament-protective role to its cofilin-synergizing
role via the b propeller domain.

Although in vitro studies of actin with one or two proteins
have given us useful mechanistic information, a more
complete picture of how the various proteins function in
vivo is obtained when increasingly complex mixtures of
purified proteins are used. In one such reconstituted
system containing cofilin, Aip1, coronin 1a, and
fluorescent actin, a new mechanism for cofilin depoly-
merization of single actin filaments was revealed [24].
F-actin disassembles in successive bursts not previously
described and not observed with cofilin alone. Because
cofilin has been shown to disrupt subunits between
adjacent helical strands of actin in filaments [25] and
Aip1 enhances cofilin severing and depolymerizing
activity by binding along cofilin-decorated actin, one
plausible mechanism suggested for the bursting activity
is weakening of inter-filament strand interactions and
the severing and removal of single-stranded actin
subunits in a depolymerizing burst [24]. This ‘coopera-
tive strand separation’ is supported by the fact that cofilin
severing by itself does not alter the binding of the F-actin
barbed-end capping protein (CapZ) but cofilin severing
in the presence of coronin 1a and Aip1 abrogates CapZ
binding. Unwinding of actin filament strands has been
observed previously in electron micrographs, though not
under the same conditions as used above [26]. However,
interference with CapZ binding could arise from other
mechanisms, so further studies are required to confirm
the strand separation model.

New cellular functions of cofilin unrelated
to actin-assembly regulation
Chaperoning actin to the nucleus
Actin itself has no nuclear localization sequence but
cofilin does. Because actin has important functions in
chromatin remodeling,
formation of heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, and gene expres-
sion [27], the ability of cofilin to enable actin nuclear

Page 3 of 7

functions is one of its crucial cellular roles. In higher
plants, in which many different isoforms of ADF are
expressed, ADF9 deficiencies produced gene expression
and chromatin remodeling phenotypes in addition to
morphological and cytoskeletal defects reflecting ADF9
cytoplasmic functions [28]. It is not known whether
these nuclear functions require actin or are mediated by
ADF9 alone.

Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c
In lymphoma cells, cofilin oxidation and its mitochon-
drial translocation were found to induce apoptosis [29].
Cofilin translocation opens the mitochondrial perme-
ability transition pore and releases cytochrome c, an early
step in apoptosis. Neither the translocation to mito-
chondria nor the release of cytochrome c requires actin
binding.

Activation of phospholipase D1
Cofilin phosphorylated on serine 3 is inactive in binding
actin and has always been considered an inactive form.

However, it was recently reported that phospho-cofilin
can directly activate phospholipase D1 (PLD1) [30], an
enzyme essential
for chemotaxis of phagocytic cells
(Figure 2). Investigation into the key role of cofilin in cell
polarization (development of a leading edge) has
previously focused on the release of active cofilin from
its inhibition through binding phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2) [1]. This lipid binding
occurs in a multivalent manner and acts not only as a
PtdIns4,5P2-density sensor on the membrane [31] but
also as a source of potentially active cofilin to generate
actin barbed ends in response to signals that cause
PtdIns4,5P2 hydrolysis [14]. The activation of PLD1 by
phospho-cofilin increases membrane phosphatidic
acid, which is required for the activation of DOCK
(dedicator of cytokinesis) proteins, a family of mem-
brane-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors for
Rac1 [32]. Rac1 is also required for polarized cell
migration. Because cofilin phosphorylation downstream
of Rac1 (via PAK [p21-activated kinase] and LIMK [LIM
kinase]) generates phospho-cofilin,
this feed-forward

Figure 2. Possible roles of cofilin and phospho-cofilin in the establishment of the leading edge

In response to signaling through a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), phospholipase C gamma (PLCg) is activated and hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2), releasing active cofilin from its inhibitory binding, allowing severing of capped quiescent filaments, and generating free barbed ends
for driving assembly. Actin-related protein 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is also activated via Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) to set up the branched
filament network driving forward protrusion of the membrane. The RTK also recruits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK), generating PtdIns3,4,5P3, which
serves as a docking site for the binding of dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2). The Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity of DOCK2 is exposed only
upon binding of the tail of DOCK2 to phosphatidic acid (PA). PA is generated from the hydrolysis of other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC),
by the enzyme phospholipase D1 (PLD1), which is activated by P-cofilin. Active Rac1 activates the p21-activated kinase (PAK1), which activates the cofilin
phosphorylation through LIM kinase (LIMK). This feed-forward cycle maintains active Rac1 at the leading edge but becomes self-limiting when cofilin
phosphatases also are recruited or become active through downstream signals from these (e.g., inositol triphosphate [IP3] → calcium → calmodulin →
calcineurin → slingshot phosphatase) and/or other pathways. DAG, diacylglycerol; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; NCK, adaptor molecule with src

cycle makes cofilin both an upstream activator and a
downstream effector of Rac1 (Figure 2).

New modes of regulation
Phospho-tyrosine-dependent cofilin turnover
The phosphoregulation of ADF and cofilin on serine 3 is
modulated by many transmembrane signaling pathways
and their multiple regulatory kinases and phosphatases
that converge on this site [1]. However, a recently iden-
tified src kinase phosphorylation site on cofilin (Y68),
but not ADF (F68), provides another mode of cofilin
regulation [33]. Phosphorylation of Y68 does not affect
the actin-dynamizing activity of cofilin but does increase
its ubiquitination and proteosome degradation to
reduce total cofilin levels and cell spreading.

In T cells,

Oxidation
Cofilin is also regulated by oxidation of its four cysteine
residues.
the generation of a C39-C80
intramolecular bond, delivered by the oxidative burst
of granulocytes, does not eliminate the actin binding of
cofilin but does increase F-actin [34]. Further studies
were performed on the activity of cofilin oxidized with
taurine chloramine, the primary oxidant generated by
activated neutrophils [29]. Two intramolecular disulfide
bonds form in cofilin in taurine-chloramine-treated
lymphoma cells in which cofilin is a main target of
oxidation. Neither disulfide bond alone inhibits cofilin-
actin binding in vitro, but actin binding is eliminated
when both internal disulfide bonds form. Furthermore,
mutation of any one of these cysteines or serine 3
phosphorylation blocks cofilin’s induction of cyto-
chrome c release from mitochondria and inhibits the
taurine-chloramine-induced apoptosis.

Future directions
It remains to be determined whether and exactly how the
concentration dependence of active cofilin in actin
turnover, stability, and nucleation contributes to the
impressive spatial coordination of actin dynamics that
underlies highly motile regions such as lamellipodia and
neuronal growth cones. Many of the effects of cofilin
previously ascribed to its direct modulation of actin may
have to be reconsidered if PLD1 is also shown to have a
role in mediating the process in question. Indeed, with
cofilin being able to function in some cells as both an
upstream activator and a downstream effector of Rac1
[10], the interpretation of results from many experiments
inter-relating Rac1 and cofilin may need to be re-
examined in light of this paradigm.

The transcriptional activity of plant ADF suggests that
ADF/cofilins in animal cells may also regulate gene
expression. Both mammalian ADF and cofilin have

proven nuclear localization sequences and have been
observed to accumulate in cell nuclei under some
conditions. If their nuclear functions turn out to be
independent of their ability to transport actin, target
genes will need to be identified and many of
the
cytoplasmic effects of ADF/cofilin activation might
need to be re-examined to determine whether they are
independent of transcriptional events.

The src kinase phosphorylation of cofilin, but not ADF,
enhances its ubiquitination and degradation and suggests
a significant potential regulatory difference between cofilin
and ADF in cellular processes involving src kinases. Indeed,
some of the tumor cell line differences that have been
observed in migration assays could result from different
levels of ADF and cofilin [5]. Certainly, this regulatory
difference suggests that a more detailed analysis of the
specific levels of ADF/cofilin species is required when
studying the roles of these proteins in cellular processes.

Cofilin plays an important role in the development and
function of both neuromuscular junctions [35] and
dendritic spines, the latter being the major excitatory
synapses in the brain [36]. Cofilin regulation is critical
for insertion of the AMPA family of glutamate receptors
into the spine membrane, which give spines their
functional plasticity important in memory and learning
[37]. Understanding mechanistically how cofilin mod-
ulates cognition requires further study.

Finally, the newly discovered effect of phospho-cofilin
on PLD1 activity suggests that additional work is needed
to define the role of
this enzyme and its cofilin
dependence in different cellular processes. PLD1 is
reported to be important in the alteration of membrane
curvature during vesicle budding, endocytosis, and
phagocytosis. Indeed, cofilin inhibition or knockdown
has profound effects on the function and dynamics of the
Golgi [38]; some may be due to actin regulation and
others may be due to PLD1 regulation. It is of interest to
determine whether cofilin phosphorylation through
transmembrane signaling is important for the regulation
of PLD1 in its many reported functions in cell migration
and phagocytosis.
