Objective: This study evaluates the presence of virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility among
enterococcal isolates from oral mucosal and deep infections.
Methods: Forty-three enterococcal strains from oral mucosal lesions and 18 from deep infections were
isolated from 830 samples that were sent during 2 years to Oral Microbiology, University of Gothenburg, for
analysis. The 61 strains were identified by 16S rDNA, and characterized by the presence of the virulence genes
efa A (endocarditis gene), gel E (gelatinase gene), ace (collagen binding antigen gene), asa (aggregation
substance gene), cyl A (cytolysin activator gene) and esp (surface adhesin gene), tested for the production of
bacteriocins and presence of plasmids. MIC determination was performed using the E-test method against the
most commonly used antibiotics in dentistry, for example, penicillin V, amoxicillin and clindamycin.
Vancomycin was included in order to detect vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strains.
Results: Sixty strains were identified as Enterococcus faecalis and one as Enterococcus faecium. All the
virulence genes were detected in more than 93.3% (efa A and esp) of the E. faecalis strains, while the presence
of phenotypic characteristics was much lower (gelatinase 10% and hemolysin 16.7%). Forty-six strains
produced bacteriocins and one to six plasmids were detected in half of the isolates.
Conclusions: Enterococcal strains from oral infections had a high virulence capacity, showed bacteriocin
production and had numerous plasmids. They were generally susceptible to ampicillins but were resistant to
clindamycin, commonly used in dentistry, and no VRE-strain was found.

Enterococci are common inhabitants of the human

intestinal microflora and the genitourinary tract
of men and women (1). Enterococci are also
frequently present in most animals and common con-
taminants in food or used as starters in meat and cheese
processing (2). Enterococci are potential pathogens in
many body sites and enterococcal infections are often
opportunistic and more prevalent in hospitalized patients
(3). The general interest for enterococci and treatment of
enterococcal infections has increased due to the appear-
ance of antibiotic multiresistant strains and especially to
the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant strains (vanco-
mycin-resistant enterococci VRE).

Enterococci

do sometimes occur and predominate in oral infections.
In persistent chronic endodontic failures, they often are
major participants (59). Enterococci show prevalence
from 3.7 to 35% in periodontitis (1012), while they
are more rarely found in peri-implantitis (13, 14). There
are few reports on enterococci in oral mucosal lesions (15).
Studies on compromised patients (1618) have reported
higher levels of enterococci than in healthy subjects. In the
above-cited studies, enterococci are rarely specified and
characterized with respect to phenotype, virulence and
antibiotic susceptibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate some viru-
lence and phenotype characteristics and the susceptib-
ility against antibiotics commonly used in dentistry,

biological diagnostic service during 2 years.

Materials and methods

Bacterial strains
During the period of 20062007 the oral microbiological
diagnostic service at the Institute of Odontology at
University of Gothenburg received 820 samples from
mucosal and deep infections from dentists. The majority
were from oral medicine and/or surgical clinics in the
western area of Sweden. Altogether 61 enterococcal
strains were collected from 43 patients with oral mucosal
infection and from 18 patients with deep infections. The
inclusion criteria were that the bacteria should be present
in predominant numbers (e.g. moderately to heavy
growth, see below) in a sample to reduce the risk that
their presence was due to temporary colonization or
contamination. In addition, one reference strain each of
Enterococcus faecalis (OMGS 3199/ATCC 47077), and
Enterococcus faecium (OMGS 3386/CCUG 542T) from
the laboratory collection were used as positive controls in
the identification procedures.

Dentists in clinics situated in the western region of
Sweden took the clinical samples and the majority came
from dentists working in or close to hospitals. The
indication for taking a sample was the patient’s complaint
or the dentist’s clinical diagnosis of a general stomatitis;
abnormal appearance of the mucosa or localized white or
red lesions of the mucosa. In addition, samples taken
in surgical departments from acute deep infections
(abscesses) were included in the survey. The samples
were transported and cultured as previously described
(15). The plates were examined for typical colony mor-
phology and were semi-quantified according to the scale
previously published (15). Very sparse growth was used for
colonies B10, sparse growth for 10100, moderate growth
for 1001,000, heavy growth for 1,00010,000 and very
heavy growth for 10,000 colonies.

Phenotype characterization
All
isolates were checked for growth on bile-esculine
(Enterococcosel agar plate, BBL, Becton, Dickinson and
Company, Sparks, MD) and tested for gelatinase activity
and hemolysis. Gelatinase activity was assessed by
inoculation of the strains in a broth containing 3%
gelatine, which was then incubated in 378C for 12 days
in an aerobic atmosphere. After 1 h cooling of the tubes
in a refrigerator, positive gelatinase activity was recorded
as degradation of the gelatine to liquid. Hemolysin
activity was recorded as a clear halo around each colony
after growth on a blood agar plate with 4% horse blood.

Genotype characterization
All strains were genotypically tested with 16S rRNA gene
sequence PCR as previously described in detail by
Sedgley et al. (9) using primers to the virulence genes:
efa A (endocarditis gene), gel E (gelatinase gene), ace
(collagen binding antigen gene), asa (aggregation sub-
stance gene), cyl A (cytolysin activator gene) and esp
(surface adhesin gene).

Antibiotic susceptibility
Routine screening for antibiotic susceptibility was per-
formed using blood agar plates and the disc diffusion
method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) against: penicillin
G, ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin,
tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and
vancomycin. After
the
inhibition zone of each strain was measured and the
strains were graded as sensitive (S), intermediate (I) and
resistant (R). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
was determined using the E-test method (AB Biodisk)
against penicillin V, amoxicillin and clindamycin. Vanco-
mycin was also included in order to confirm presence of
tentative VRE strains. The MICs were read from the
intercept where the elipse inhibition zone intersected with
the scale. The MICs including 90 and 50% of the strains
were calculated.

Bacteriocin testing
Bacteriocin production was tested according to Sedgley
et al. (4) against the following bacterial target strains:
Enterococcus faecium strain OMGS 3386, Enterococcus
faecalis strain OMGS 3382 (bacteriocin positive strain
termed GS31 in Sedgley et al. (9)) and E. faecalis strain
OMGS 3199 (bacteriocin negative control termed GS3
in Sedgley et al. (9)), Streptococcus mutans (OMGS
2482), Streptococcus mitis (OMGS 1770), Streptococcus
oralis (OMGS 2470), Lactobacillus fermentum (OMGS
3182) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (OMGS 3179). The
target (indicator) strains were grown overnight in BHI
broth (BBL) and then 0.5 ml (OD600 0.81.0) was added
to 10 ml of liquefied soft agar (0.75%) and poured on a
BHI agar plate. After solidification, samples from single
colonies of the producer strains (60 E. faecalis strains)
were placed on the agar. After aerobic incubation over-
night at 378C, clear zones were visible around the
bacteriocin producing strains. The zones were graded
as strong, moderate, weak and negative with reference
to their size. Some producer strains seemed to inter-
act with other enterococcal target (indicator) strains
giving a turbid zone around the colonies instead of a
clear one.

Plasmid determination
The presence of plasmids in each strain was estimated
according to Engbrecht et al. ((19), basic protocol 1:

overnight in 1.5 ml Brain heart infusion broth (BBL)
were centrifuged during 1 min and the supernatant was
removed. The pellet was re-suspended in glucose/tris/
EDTA (GTE) solution, with 2 mg/ml lysozyme (Roche,
Stockholm, Sweden) and kept at room temperature for
30 min before 200 ml NaOH (0.2N in 1% SDS) solution
was added. After mixing, 150 ml of potassium acetate
solution was added for neutralization, vortexed and
placed on ice for 5 min. The cell debris and chromosomal
DNA were spun down and the supernatant was trans-
ferred to a new tube with 0.8 ml of 95% ethanol and kept
at room temperature for precipitation of nucleic acids
(plasmid DNA and RNA). The supernatant was removed
and the pellet washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol and
dried. After the pellet was re-suspended in 30 ml TE
buffer/0.1 mg/ml RNase, a volume of 35 ml was used as a
restriction digest. Plasmid DNA restriction fragments
were separated on 0.7% agarose gels in TBE buffer. The
gels were stained with ethinium bromide for 30 min and
the bands were made visible by fluorescence under UV
light.

Results
Altogether 61 enterococcal strains were isolated during
the period of 20062007. Sixty of the 61 isolates were
identified as E. faecalis and 1 as E. faecium. Samples from
39 females and 32 males were included and the age
ranged from 3 to 99 years (mean 63.2, median 67). Forty-
three strains,
faecium strain, were
isolated from oral mucosal lesions and 18 from deep

including the E.

Among the patients with oral mucosal infections, four
were on antibiotics (penicillin, isoxapenicillin or amox-
icillin),
two were on antiviral medication, six were
on antifungal medication, nine had no antimicrobial
medication and for 22 the data were missing. For the
patients with oral deep infections, all 18 patients were on
antimicrobial medication, 10 used clindamycin (3 in
combination with ciprofloxacin), 1 penicillin, 1 isoxapeni-
cillin, 1 cephalosporinvancomycin. For five subjects,
data on type of antibiotics used were lacking.

a-Hemolytic streptococci were the most common co-
isolates in samples from the oral mucosa. Also Prevotella
spp. and Fusobacterium spp. were quite common in the
predominant flora on the tongue as well as Haemophilus
parainfluenzae on the buccal mucosa. Notably many of
the mucosal samples had other opportunists in significant
quantities. Twenty-eight had Candida, 21 enteric rods and
5 Staphylococcus aureus in heavy growth.

Gelatinase was detected in 6 (10%), hemolysin in 10
(16.7%) and plasmids in 30 (50%) of the E. faecalis strains
(Table 2). None of these were detected in the E. faecium
strain. It was, however, positive for the six investigated
virulence genes for which the detection frequency ranged
from 93 to 100% of the E. faecalis isolates (Table 2).

Clearly visible zones around enterococcal

strains
indicating a significant production of bacteriocins were
detected for 10 isolates against enterococccal
target
strains (Table 3). Little effect was noticed against oral
streptococci and lactobacilli, except for S. salivarius for
which six E. faecalis strains and the E. faecium strain
showed growth inhibition.

Ampicillin and amoxicillin showed the strongest effect
on the enterococci but only 57.4 and 31.1%, respectively,
of the isolates were susceptible, as screened routinely by
the disc diffusion method. Using the E-test method for
estimation of MIC values, all of the E. faecalis strains
were susceptible as well as the E. faecium isolate for
amoxicillin. Of
the strains from mucosal and deep
infection samples, 90% showed minimal inhibitory con-
centrations (MIC90) of 256 mg/ml or more against
clindamycin (Table 4). All enterococcal strains were
sensitive to vancomycin.

Discussion
This study describes phenotypic and genotypic char-
acteristics of 60 E. faecalis and 1 E. faecium isolates
from oral mucosal infections and deep oral infections.

No significant differences between the isolates due to
their origin were disclosed.

Enterococci are widely distributed in the environment
and they are predominant in the upper part of the
intestine. They are also considered transient in the oral
cavity and may even occur in low numbers in the resident
flora of some individuals (4). It is an important micro-
organism in foods, either as probiotic,
starters or
contaminants in meat and cheese handling or processing
(2, 20, 21). On the other hand, they are important
pathogens, and reported as a major cause of nosocomial
infections and are commonly isolated in urinary tract
infection, in the blood steam and at surgical sites (3). The
predominant species in infections is E. faecalis followed
by E. faecium. E. faecium has, however, gained much
attention lately since it is reported to be frequently
identified among VRE isolates (22).

Studies on oral enterococci have been quite extensive
due to their common appearance in root canal infections.
Less is known on oral transient/resident strains and
strains from oral infections apart from endodontic ones
(15). In this study of samples arriving in the laboratory
during 2 years, we found enterococci to be part of the
predominant flora in 61 cases with acute symptoms
from the mucosa or from deeper located abscesses.
The samples were rarely monoinfections, but rather
accompanied by other oral bacteria or other opportu-
nists. E. faecalis was present
in amounts (moderate
growth or more) that indicated them to be part of the
infection process and not only as resident bystanders. The
species distribution in oral mucosal or deep oral infec-
tions seems to be very similar to infections in other body
sites, with the majority being classified as E. faecalis.

opportunists and, similar to other opportunists such as
Candida spp., S. aureus and enteric rods (16), they appear
commonly in patients who are immunosuppressed for
various reasons. This was also the case in this study,
where the patients were generally older and where
62.8% had general and systemic diseases. This ecological
disharmony may be a consequence of the hard medical
treatment, which has reduced the resident streptococci,
Neisseria, Haemophilus and anaerobes (Prevotella and
Fusobacterium spp.). This condition is difficult to treat as
long as the medication is ongoing and the treatment will
consequently be symptomatic.

This study shows that deep enterococcal infections in
the jaws (abscesses, bone sequestration and open surgical
wounds) do occur and should be considered in the choice
of antibiotics. All 18 cases were on antimicrobial treat-
ment and 10 of them were on clindamycin, a drug that is
not suitable for enterococcal infections. Unfortunately,
clindamycin prescription by dentists is increasing, pro-
bably due to overuse or recommendations to use clin-
damycin in penicillin allergy cases (23). The frequent
occurrence of enterococcal infections in the oral cavity
points to the importance for an appropriate microbiolo-
gical diagnosis and susceptibility test in cases of need for
antibiotic treatment.

Enterococcal species do not display a large panel of
virulence factors of the type seen in other Gram-positive
cocci,
such as S. aureus and hemolytic Group A
streptococci. Factors that are commonly discussed for
enterococci are hemolysin (cytolysin), gelatinase, aggre-
gation factor and surface adhesins (24, 25). The fre-
quency of hemolysin and gelatinase positive phenotypes
was low (10 and 16.7%, respectively) although the
presence of the genes (cylA and gelE) was identified in
almost all of the E. faecalis strains. The frequency of
hemolysin and gelatinase positive strains varies greatly
among the studies and the clinical conditions from which
the enterococci were isolated. Sedgley et al. (9) reported
gelatinase in 93% of primary endodontic infections
but only 25% in retreatment cases. Gelatinase positive
E. faecalis has further been isolated in a large proportion
of hospitalized patients and patients with endocarditis
(26). Interestingly, previous studies reported that none of

35 endodontic isolates was hemolytic (9) while 37% of
clinical isolates and 31% of fecal isolates from hospita-
lized patients were hemolytic (26). Among healthy
Norwegian infants, 29% of the E. faecalis strains were
cytolysin positive and 48% positive for gelatinase, while
the genes cylL and gelE were identified in 52 and 94% of
the strains (27). An even greater discrepancy between the
genotype and phenotype characteristics was seen in the
present study. It seems that enterococci participating in
clinical infections express more of the virulence factors
than enterococci in chronic persistent endodontic cases
where non-expressed (‘sleeping’) genes are common. This
is in line with Creti et al. (28), who reported that
gelatinase activity was correlated with sleeping genes of
gelE. They also concluded that strains from endocarditis
and commensals expressed a lower number of virulence
factors than isolates from other sites, while strains from
urinary tract infections had expressed the most. The
presence of the genes in this study shows a similar pattern
to that previously reported for endodontic and non-
endodontic oral strains, where efaA, gel E, ace and asa
were found in 100% of the isolates (4). Two other genes
cyl A, coding for hemolysin and esp, coding for surface
adhesion, were present in 100 and 93.3% of samples
respectively in this study. This is considerably higher than
reported for isolates from healthy subjects, where they
were present in 18 and 60% of samples respectively (4).
Both these genes are present in pathogenicity islands
(PAI) that are suggested to be enriched among infection-
derived enterococcal isolates (29). Coque et al. (26) found
cylA in 50% of the enterococcal strains in bacteremia
cases, in 11% of endocarditis cases and none from stool
samples. Our isolates that were related to acute infections
may be another indication of this enrichment, despite the
phenotypic expression of, for example, hemolysin was
low. Eaton and Gasson (20) also concluded that medical
isolates had more virulence genes than E. faecalis isolates
from food that in turn had more than those used as
starters in food processing. Conclusively, almost all
isolates from the oral mucosa as well as deep infections
seem to have the capacity to produce and express all the
common virulence factors. This might also suggest that
oral isolates are not primarily obtained in the oral cavity

as contaminants from food, but rather transmitted from
human sources.

An important aspect of virulence is how the specific
bacteria can compete with the resident flora in the
normal ecology of a body site. In healthy individuals,
the ecology is to some extent self-limiting and does not
allow overgrowth of other microorganisms. Apparently,
enterococci are sometimes part of the resident flora, even
though their prevalence in healthy individuals (students)
is quite low. Enterococci are well-known producers
of bacteriocins (4). However,
in this study we have
seen that the bacteriocins are targeted mostly at other
enterococcal strains rather than against other oral species
such as a-hemolytic streptococci and lactobacilli. This
is in agreement with Sedgley et al. (30), who identi-
fied ‘siblicides’ among the enterococcal strains. Enter-
ococci are believed to be important biofilm participants
(3134). Even if enterococci are not present in high
numbers in the dental plaque biofilm, they may have an
important role as a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant
genes, which can be transferred to other bacteria in the
biofilm (12, 35).

the E.

Twenty-two of

faecalis isolates (37%) also
contained plasmids, of which nine had several (range
26). Sedgley et al. (9), found one to four plasmids in 25
out of the 31 endodontic strains. Plasmids are also
commonly found in medical and food isolates and
exchange of plasmids between enterococcal strains are
potentially likely (21). Plasmids are also commonly found
in medical and food isolates and exchange of plasmids
between enterococcal strains are potentially likely (21).
Thus, conjugation and horizontal spread of genes includ-
ing resistance genesis are probably quite common in
humans, further explained by the common production of
pheromones (9). Pheromones are a kind of clumping
factor that supports close contact with the bacterial cells,
allowing conjugation to take place. The supposedly
frequent conjugation between enterococcal cells facil-
itates the spread of antibiotic resistance.

Conclusions
Enterococci, predominantly E. faecalis were detected in
both mucosal and deep oral infections. The frequency of
hemolysis and gelatinase positive strains was low but
almost all isolates had the virulence genes efaA, gelE,
ace, asa, cylA and esp. The isolates produced bacteriocins,
mostly directed against other enterococcal
isolates.
Of the isolates, 37% had plasmids. The 61 enterococcal
isolates showed a tested antibiotic susceptibility for
amoxicillin but were resistant to clindamycin. These are
two of the most used antibiotics in dentistry for severe oral
mucosal and deep infections. All isolates were susceptible to
vancomycin.
