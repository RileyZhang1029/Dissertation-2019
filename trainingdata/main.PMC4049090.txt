http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2013.10.002   Reisdorph N et al / Omics Hands-on Workshop  369  a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored 10-day Genomics and Proteomics Hands-on Workshop held at National Jewish Health (NJH) and the University of Colorado School of Medicine (UCD).
The course content included comprehensive lectures and laboratories in mass spectrometry and genomics technologies, extensive hands-on experience with instrumentation and software, video demonstrations, optional workshops, online sessions, invited keynote speakers, and local and national guest faculty.
Here we describe the detailed curriculum and present the results of short- and long-term evaluations from course attendees.
Our educational program consis- tently received positive reviews from participants and had a substantial impact on grant writing and review, manuscript submissions and publications.
Introduction  In recent years, genomics and proteomics have emerged as key technologies in biomedical research programs.
These types of analyses are now critical to performing effective clinical re- search aimed at developing a better understanding of disease pathology, as well as designing new approaches for clinical treatment [1].
For example, as genomic technologies have ma- tured, so have a growing number of examples of genomic pro- ﬁles directly being used to create individualized treatment plans [2].
These include the use of relatively simple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for determining an appropriate treatment plan or for predicting the chemother- apeutic regimen most likely to beneﬁt a breast cancer patient [3 5].
In addition, mass spectrometry, metabolomics and pro- teomics are becoming essential for providing sensitive methods of characterizing and analyzing both small molecules and pro- teins [6 12].
Both genomics and proteomics have proven so successful in these regards that demand has far exceeded the supply of trained personnel equipped to exploit the available technologies.
This has resulted in a surge of interest in training by investigators keen to utilize these technologies in their re- search.
The need for researchers trained in omics technologies has been described by several groups, including working groups from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [13].
In our own experience, the demand for training has been demon- strated at local, national and international levels.
For example, in the past 8 years, previously established hands-on workshops in Metabolomics and Proteomics at National Jewish Health (NJH) and the University of Colorado School of Medicine (UCD) have been attended by over 400 individuals from around the world.
To support technology-dependent clinical research studies, at least two types of training in omics technologies can be envisioned: (1) immediate short-term training in the form of workshops and (2) long-term instruction in the form of gradu- ate education and visiting science programs.
We aimed to ﬁll the former need by providing an intensive and comprehensive hands-on training course in genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics in a coherent experimentally-based framework.
Information gleaned from former participants  surveys enabled us to determine that there is still a large need for intro- ductory courses which focus on biomedical research such as the one described herein.
Several recent publications have focused on the need for experimental standards in omics research, especially when ap- plied to human disease [14 17] and education is one means of lessening experimental error.
To be of maximum beneﬁt, edu- cation should ideally occur before experimental planning has begun, in order to decrease the possibility that the wrong  platform, technology, experimental design or data analysis is chosen.
For example, a ﬁrst step toward utilizing omics technologies is the development of a well-deﬁned hypothesis which clearly outlines the research question under investiga- tion.
If a researcher is interested in global expression patterns and/or biomarkers, he/she will need to determine if genomics, metabolomics or proteomics is more appropriate.
Alterna- tively, an investigator may determine that a combination of approaches is necessary.
Even after determining a general approach, the researcher must choose which speciﬁc platform and sample preparation strategies to utilize and this requires an understanding of the technologies available and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Given the pleth- ora of equipment and protocols currently available, a new investigator could conceivably become overwhelmed by alter- natives and subsequently make a poor choice that could lead to downstream difﬁculties in data analysis and interpretation.
After determining an appropriate platform in which to test the hypothesis, careful experimental design and quality control measures are also critical to the success of the project as well as for interpreting the results.
Given the large datasets gener- ated by these technologies, knowledge of data analysis work- ﬂows and options, biostatistics and bioinformatics are vital and these are areas in which many investigators require addi- tional training, speciﬁcally in the context of omics research.
Fi- nally, interpretation of omics results is dependent on a broad understanding of biochemistry and molecular biology, often presented within a knowledge-based pathway framework.
Our training course exposed participants to each of these areas and, more speciﬁcally, enabled them to make informed deci- sions regarding the critical choice of platform for their partic- ular research question.
To this end, we assembled a group of educators and scien- tists who understand the need for training and have experience in omics technologies and hands-on workshops.
NJH is a pre- mier hospital and research institution with a reputation for high quality clinical and basic research, effective professional education and extensive collaborations.
The mass spectrome- try facility is well established and supports over 100 national investigators involved in NIH-funded research in lung and immune diseases, diabetes, nutrition/obesity and others [18 25].
Similarly, the Program Directors at Colorado State University (CSU) and UCD have established genomics and proteomics in pulmonary diseases, cancer and women s health, and have programs in nutrition, environmental and microbial science [26 38].
The Directors of the workshop have developed and taught courses and workshops covering the subjects of metabolomics, genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and biostatistics.
In general, we accomplished the following: (1) built a curriculum focusing  research and support projects   370  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 368 377  on outcome-structured learning in genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics technologies, which enabled investigators to immediately apply their knowledge to existing research studies  (2) provided novel, multidisciplinary training experiences using hands-on techniques and an established model by experienced investigators and educators  (3) disseminated educational materials such that knowledge and information could be used to beneﬁt a wide variety of audiences  and (4) provided a portal for collaborative opportunities for both young and established investigators, thereby encouraging formation of interdisciplin- ary teams.
The intensive course schedule covered 10 consecutive days and was offered annually from 2007 to 2010 in the summer months.
The NHLBI provided funding through a T15 award (N. Reisdorph, Principal Investigator) which covered faculty salary, invited keynote speakers, transportation between insti- tutions and hotels, administrative support and laboratory module consumables.
One salient feature of the course was the inclusion of over 20 faculty members with an array of expe- rience spanning genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, biosta- tistics, mass spectrometry, genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, lung and heart disease, clinical studies, human research, and mouse and cell models.
In addition, a number of vendors (Agilent Technologies, Affymetrix, Biorad and Pierce) provided laboratory module consumables as well as beverages, lunches and keynote speaker dinners for partici- pants.
Participants paid for their travel and housing expenses and a moderate $1000 tuition fee was charged to cover items not covered through the T15 award, including catering and keynote receptions.
Scholarships were available each year to cover all costs for up to four participants.
Course details  The genomics and proteomics workshop structure combined hands-on training with lecture-based learning.
It was carefully designed to allow students to experience an application-based workﬂow from sample preparation to data analysis.
Classes were composed of no more than 22 students, who were split into 2 groups.
Following an introductory session on the day of arrival, Group 1 attended proteomics training for days 2 4, then optional workshops for day 5, then genomics train- ing for days 6 8 and ﬁnally bioinformatics for days 8 10 (Table 1 showing general schedule).
Conversely, Group 2 attended genomics training for days 2 4, then optional work- shops for day 5, then proteomics training for days 6 8 and ﬁnally bioinformatics for days 8 10.
This allowed for small class size and one-on-one contact during instruction, while enabling all participants to interact with each other.
Individual curricula for genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and optional workshops are described below and detailed sched- ules are included in the online supplementary information.
Information on group events is also described.
Proteomics curriculum  A copy of the course curriculum is included in the supplemen- tary information (Supplementary File 1), with proteomics spanning days 2 4.
The proteomics curriculum was carefully designed to maximize the retention of information and mini- mize student fatigue.
Training material was presented in both  lecture and laboratory session modules.
Lectures and labora- tory sessions were strategically interspersed throughout the 3 day period.
Thus student training time consistently alter- nated between lecture and hands-on activities, thereby reduc- ing mental fatigue and helping to keep students engaged.
Lectures and laboratory sessions were ordered logically to re- ﬂect a typical workﬂow, i.e., sample preparation   data acqui- sition   data analysis.
Lecture topics included introduction to mass spectrometry and database searching, quantitative pro- teomics, advanced technologies and clinical proteomics.
Dur- ing hands-on lab sections, students were divided into groups of three, making the student-to-instructor ratio 3:1.
The com- position of these groups was predetermined by experience level and remained the same throughout the entire course.
This pro- vided an element of consistency that helped students feel com- fortable with the learning environment.
It also enabled the laboratory instructor to tailor the session to meet the needs of the individual participants.
For example, the instructor may spend additional time describing the individual compo- nents of a mass spectrometer to one group, but may discuss speciﬁc method parameters with another more experienced group.
Laboratory sessions were divided into three stations and organized in a rotation-based format.
Each group of three students spent 60 75 min per rotation at the following stations: sample preparation, informatics and data analysis.
Over the course of the workshop, students returned several times to speciﬁc lab stations to continue and complete various aspects of sample preparation and instruction on mass spectrometry instruments and software.
This rotation style for- mat exposes students to a wide variety of proteomics and mass spectrometry concepts, while maintaining the continuity re- quired to effectively experience an application-based workﬂow from sample preparation to data analysis.
instrumentation,  During laboratories, students were taken through typical proteomics work ﬂows from sample preparation to data acqui- sition and from data analysis to protein identiﬁcation.
Each student was responsible for preparing their own digested pro- tein sample and students contributed to creating mass spec- trometry data acquisition methods.
Students identiﬁed the protein(s) in their sample during the database search labora- tory session, which was the ﬁnal session of the 3-day proteo- mics course.
In the days leading up to this ﬁnal session, students were reminded that they would discover the identity of the protein(s) in their sample and there was a friendly com- petition to see who would have the highest search result score.
This was designed to build anticipation and help keep students engaged.
Genomics curriculum  A copy of the course curriculum is included in the Supplemen- tary File 1, with genomics spanning days 6 8.
The genomics curriculum schedule interweaved hands-on bench work with lectures and demonstration videos.
For the hands-on section, the participants in 5 groups of 2 converted total RNA into biotinylated cDNA using the standard protocol for running on an Affymetrix gene expression microarray.
Quality control of the intermediate and ﬁnal products was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer.
During incubation times, lectures and demonstration videos were presented.
The lecture topics included: principles and applications of DNA microarray     ) 0 1     y a D  (  y a d i r F  y a d s r u h T    ) 9     y a D  (  y a d s e n d e W    ) 8     y a D  (  y a d s e u T    ) 7     y a D  (  y a d n o M    ) 6     y a D  (  y a d n u S    ) 5     y a D  (  y a d r u t a S    ) 4     y a D  (    ) 3     y a D  (  y a d i r F  y a d s r u h T    ) 2     y a D  (  s c i m o n e G  g n i n r o M  s c i m o e t o r P  g n i n r o M  s c i m o n e G  s c i m o n e G  s c i m o e t o r P  s c i m o e t o r P  s c i m o e t o r P  g n i n r o M  s c i m o n e G  g n i n r o M  s c i m o e t o r P  s c i m o e t o r P  s c i m o n e G  s c i m o n e G  Reisdorph N et al / Omics Hands-on Workshop  371  s c i t a m r o f n i o i B  g n i n r o M  s c i t a m r o f n i o i B  y a d    l l  A  l a s s i  m  s i D  n o o n r e t f  A     y t l u c a f   t s e u g     y b    e r u t c e L  s c i t a m r o f n i o i B  n o o n r e t f  A    e m  i t   e e r F     s p o h s k r o w  l a n o i t p O  n o o n r e t f  A  e r u t c e l  t n i o J  2  p u o r G  , y l e s r e v n o C  .

In the ﬁnal year s course offering (2010), lectures in next-generation sequencing methods and applications were expanded.
Various hands-on components typically completed by genomic core personnel were presented by video demonstrations, including microarray sample loading, washing, staining and scanning.
Bioinformatics curriculum  A copy of the course curriculum is included in the Supplemen- tary File 1, with bioinformatics spanning days 8 10.
All bioin- formatics instructions were provided in the computational lab and synchronized with the laboratory sessions for a unique hands-on approach.
Lecture topics included experimental de- sign, power analysis, data pre-processing, quality control, exploratory data analysis, class discovery, differential expres- sion and class prediction.
The BRB-Array Tools software, based on an Excel interface of R BioConductor packages, was used for demonstrations by the instructors ollowed by hands-on sessions by the participants.
This software was se- lected since it allowed participants with a diverse computa- tional background to learn the fundamental data analysis steps in a user-friendly environment.
Additional bioinformat- ics instruction was provided on the ﬁnal days of the workshop and covered additional online resources such as Genome Browsers, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Promoter Analysis, Gene Ontology Analysis, Database Resources for Genetic Variations and Disorders and in later years, an introduction to Next-generation Sequencing Data Analysis.
Keynote and special lectures, optional workshops and on-line training  In addition to the genomics, proteomics and informatics curricula, the course consisted of 4 keynote lectures, one half-day of optional workshops, and pre- and post-course online training.
Table 2 lists keynote lecturers and their afﬁli- ations.
Special lectures that were presented by local speakers are also listed in Table 2.
Optional workshops varied each year depending on interest.
Optional workshops were held on participants  Sunday morning and included the following topics: Additional Hands-on Experience with Mass Spectrometers, Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis, Introduction to Grant Writing, Biostatistics, Alternate Microarray Platform, Bioinformatics, MicroRNA Analysis and Literature Reviews.
Online training was held via live and recorded sessions and consisted of introductory material for the proteomics sessions.
A schedule with topics is listed in Supplementary File 2.
In addition, a 4-session online workshop was held in January 2012 to provide updated information to participants (Supple- mentary File 3).

This was accomplished both through annual review and revision of material, and through the ﬁnal online session.
All sessions were recorded and are available by con- tacting the corresponding author.
Participant demographics and statistics  The workshop was aimed at junior and senior investigators but was also open to postdoctoral and clinical fellows and senior graduate students.
In all, we provided hands-on and web-based training to 87 individuals from 55 institu- tions, all of whom rated the training they received as out- standing at the end of the course.
Over 120 individuals applied for training and, as the course was NIH-NHLBI funded, priority was given to individuals with funding in an area related to heart, lung or blood diseases.
Participants were chosen based on recommendations from a selection committee composed of course directors, instructors and advisors.
Educational experience of participants from the four annual course offerings included: BS/BA (13%), PhD (33%), MD (48%) and MD/PhD (6%) (Figure 1A).
Participants were primarily (48% of total) faculty members including Assistant Professor (26%), Associate Professor (6%), Professor (7%), Research Assistant Professor (3%) and Instructor (3%), although postdocs and fellows made  A  2% 2% 2%  12%  14%  16%  8%  4%  3%  B  13%  30%  7%  Asst Professor Assoc Professor Professor Research Asst Professor Instructor Postdoc Fellow Graduate Student Core Manager Technician Other/Unknown  48%  MD  MD/PhD  PhD  BS/BA  33%  6%  Figure 1 Participant demographics Shown are professional positions (A) and educational background (B) of course participants.

up 30% of the participants (Figure 1B).
Just over 10% of par- ticipants were graduate students and 2 proteomics core manag- ers attended the course.
Generally speaking, only 5% of the participants stated that they had signiﬁcant training in omics and considered themselves experts, with the vast majority not having any prior training.
Information gleaned from these participants  statistics enabled us to determine that there is still a large need for introductory courses which focus on biomed- ical research.
While advanced course work is certainly neces- sary, our course ﬁlled the signiﬁcant niche for introductory and mid-level investigators.
Short-term evaluations  Following each section, participants were asked to ﬁll out a web-based evaluation form which was developed in collabora- tion with Dr. Carol Hodgson, an Associate Dean for Curricu- lum and Evaluation and Director of the Educational Development and Research Ofﬁce at the University of Colo- rado, Denver.
The form required rating various aspects of the workshop from poor, fair, good, very good and excellent, with corresponding numerical scores of 1 (poor) 5 (excellent).
Median scores were tabulated for each laboratory and lecture and for administrative and overall course ratings.
Composite scores for courses are shown in Figure 2.
Scores for   overall quality   of the workshops in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 4.76, 4.80, 4.84 and 4.63, respectively (far right of bar graph).
Course evaluations were taken seriously and were critical to shaping and improving the following years  offering.
For example, a number of participants suggested video demonstra- tions to replace hands-on genomics sample preparation, which was implemented in 2008.
In addition, bioinformatics sessions originally spanned entire days  however these were split into half-days and interspersed with hands-on laboratory sessions after participant feedback suggested there were too many hours spent in the computer lab.
Lectures and labs that re- ceived relatively poor ratings (greater than 10% fair ratings  or that had less than 40% excellent ratings) were revised where possible in subsequent years.
Long-term evaluations  Approximately 3 months following the 2010 course, a follow- up evaluation was distributed to former NHLBI 10-day omics course attendees.
Supplementary File 4 lists the ques- tions that were asked to participants.
Of particular note is that of the 49 responders, 98% rated the course very good to excellent and 100% indicated that they would recommend the course to others.
Ninety-eight percent of responders rated the quality of the workshop as very good to excellent.
Impressively, 44% said that the workshop had had high im- pact on their research.
As shown in Figure 3, responders who were frequently using speciﬁc techniques in their own labora- tories, or through a core facility, more than quadrupled fol- lowing the course.
For example, only 10% frequently used genomics informatics techniques prior to the course, but over 50% frequently used these techniques following the course.
This could indicate that education helped overcome a signif- icant barrier in learning by exposing individuals to the tech- niques in a hands-on fashion.
In addition to increased utilization of techniques, training apparently helped partici- pants in other aspects of their work.
Figure 4 shows the re- sults to the question   please indicate if you have used knowledge gained in the course in any of the following sce- narios  .
Almost all participants indicated that they had used knowledge gained in the workshop in reading journal articles (96%) and attending scientiﬁc meetings/seminars (94%).
An impressive 76% indicated that the course had beneﬁted them in terms of manuscript review, and almost half indicated the course had helped with non-NIH grant review and thesis re- view.
This indicates that the course not only helped with re- search programs, but the knowledge gained was applied in a myriad of other ways, all of which have a direct positive im- pact on NIH-funded omics research.

Reisdorph N et al / Omics Hands-on Workshop  375  Participant comments  In addition to ranking speciﬁc course elements, participants were asked to provide written feedback regarding the course.
This enabled participants to make speciﬁc requests regarding the curriculum.
For example, in the ﬁrst year the curriculum included a   mock grant proposal   which entailed working in groups to develop short grant proposals that included genom- ics and proteomics experiments.
Groups were balanced to in- clude junior and senior scientists and were given time for 2 group discussions and 1 presentation.
In addition to the dis- cussion periods, participants were also encouraged to discuss the mock proposals during non-workshop hours as a means of facilitating collaborations after the workshop.
While over half of the participants rated the mock grant proposal modules as very good to excellent, their written comments demon- strated that the inclusion of this module was too time-consum- ing and challenging and it was thus eliminated in subsequent workshops.
Participant feedback also resulted in developing videos to complement the genomics modules, including alternate genom- ics strategies (SNP, next-generation sequencing), including more proteomics informatics sessions, expanding quantitative proteomics sessions and decreasing the amount of material covered in the bioinformatics sessions.
A short compilation of written comments submitted by workshop attendees is in- cluded in Supplementary File 5.
Technical details and additional information  A search of PubMed and educational journals demonstrated a lack of publications related to omics-based education, in spite of the availability of several courses at educational and indus- trial institutions.
To our knowledge, the described course con- stituted the only hands-on multi-omics course of its kind.
As mentioned, the NHLBI provided signiﬁcant funding to enable the presentation of the courses from 2007 to 2010 and hence no further courses are currently being held.
Therefore, we have in- cluded additional information that could be of use to others in the ﬁeld of omics education and training.
Advertising  The course was advertised through several portals including lo- cal institutions, institutions with primarily-underserved mem- bers, vendor contact lists, proteomics and genomics core laboratories and websites.
Scientists receiving funding from NHLBI for proteomics or genomics research were identiﬁed through the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) website and contacted through email.
Course bro- chures were also sent to prospective and previous participants and course instructors for distribution.
Course demand  directors determined that 20 22 participants allowed individu- als to receive experience on instrumentation while providing substantial one-on-one time with instructors.
While lecture- only based courses could conceivably reach a larger audience, by deﬁnition they lack hands-on experience.
The drop in de- mand from the last 2 years was attributed to several circum- stances including a declining national economy that resulted in a decrease in overall scientiﬁc budgets.
In addition, the course necessarily recruited investigators whose research fo- cused on heart, lung and blood studies and our applicant pool was therefore limited.
Members of industry were also not al- lowed to attend the course.
Based on the number of inquiries between 2007 and 2010 from non-NHLBI investigators, and based on full capacity for current metabolomics and proteo- mics courses at NJH and UCD, it is the opinion of the authors that there is still a high demand for these types of hands-on courses.
Summary and accessing course material  Course evaluations and participant comments have shown that our intensive hands-on workshop formats are an effective model for presenting essential lecture and laboratory informa- tion in a relatively short amount of time.
This curriculum could be the framework for long-term training strategies and can be conducted in any number of laboratories.
While inten- sive, 10 days seemed an appropriate length of time for the course and allowed full-time researchers, physician-scientists, post-docs and graduate students to attend.
