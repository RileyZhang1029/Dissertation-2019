Oral Treponema species, most notably T. denticola, are implicated in the destructive effects of human
periodontal disease. Progress in the molecular analysis of interactions between T. denticola and host proteins
is reviewed here, with particular emphasis on the characterization of surface-expressed and secreted proteins
of T. denticola involved in interactions with host cells, extracellular matrix components, and components of
the innate immune system.

Keywords: spirochetes; virulence factors; periodontal disease

Approximately 30% of the US adult population

has at least one periodontal site with demon-
strable gingival recession and bone loss (1). In
contrast to healthy gingival plaque in which the complex
microbial community dominated by facultative Gram-
positives, periodontal
lesions harbors a microflora
dominated by proteolytic Gram-negative anaerobes and
spirochetes (2, 3). While a consortium of three organisms
denoted as the ‚Äòred complex‚Äô (Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola) has the
highest association with periodontal disease severity (4),
spirochetes in particular are associated with severe and
refractory periodontal conditions (2, 58). In periodontal
lesions, spirochetes preferentially localize in the deepest
part of the ‚Äòpocket,‚Äô specifically at the interface between
the subgingival plaque and the epithelium (9). In advanced
periodontitis, their ability to disrupt intercellular junctions
likely contributes to invasion of underlying tissue (1014).
T. denticola, the most readily cultivable oral spirochete, is
the model organism for studying both the unique
biological features of these organisms and Treponema
host interactions in periodontal disease. Virulence-asso-
ciated behaviors (15, 16) of T. denticola include adherence
to host tissue and other microbes, motility, chemotaxis,
tissue penetration, and release of immunomodulatory
and cytopathic factors (reviewed in (17)). The numerical
prevalence of spirochetes in disease, along with their high
association with and location within diseased sites,
strongly suggests that they play an important role in
disease initiation and progression (4, 6, 9, 18).

Oral spirochetes, including T. denticola and over 50
other Treponema species, present unique challenges and

opportunities to the field of molecular and cellular
microbiology. Foremost among these challenges is the
fact that at least 80% of oral Treponema spp. have never
been cultured, and only T. denticola has been studied in
detail. These nutritionally fastidious anaerobes possess
features unique among bacteria, including cellular struc-
ture (19), motility apparatus (20), biosynthetic pathways
(21), and outer membrane protein complexes (22, 23). As
commensal residents and opportunistic pathogens of oral
mucosal tissue, they offer a wide range of potential
avenues for research into microbehost interactions and
signaling, microbial communities, microbial physiology,
and molecular evolution. Thus, molecular level studies of
oral spirochetes are timely and of high importance
in understanding chronic bacterial
infections such as
periodontal disease.

the total of

Treponema denticola exists in a complex, multispecies
biofilm environment in the gingival crevice. Numerous
interbacterial interactions required for development and
maintenance of the subgingival microbial community
have been documented or proposed (24). These dynamic
interactions comprise only part of
the
environmental milieu in which these organisms have
evolved. The oral microbiota live in a host mucosal
environment consisting of several host cell types and
extracellular matrix (ECM) components as potential
substrates in addition to a fluid environment consisting
of a complex and variable mix of saliva, gingival
crevicular fluid, and serum components, including nu-
merous antimicrobial components of both the innate and
adaptive immune systems. As obligately host-associated
organisms, oral spirochetes are extremely well adapted to

survival
in a eukaryotic host environment. This is
reflected, as in many other host-associated microbes, in
the relatively large number of T. denticola genes that can
be clearly identified as having been acquired by horizon-
tal gene transfer from an ancestral eukaryotic host
(2527). To understand the factors that allow commensal
organisms to induce pathogenic responses under certain
host environmental conditions, it is necessary to under-
stand how they survive without causing disease. The
focus of
this review is on the interactions between
T. denticola and host components that mediate both its
persistence in the oral environment and its pathogenicity
in periodontal disease. Primary attention will be given to
interactions that are at least partially characterized and
understood at the molecular level, and understudied
areas will be pointed out where appropriate.

vincentii provisional annotated genome

Research on oral spirochetes has progressed in recent
years, driven partly by completion of the T. denticola
the
genome sequence (25). Recent online release of
(http://
T.
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/55865) and the unas-
sembled genome sequence contigs of T. lecithinolyticum
(28) have expanded the genomic resources for this group
of oral microbes. Additionally, the Human Oral Micro-
biome Project is in the process of sequencing several
other T. denticola strains (29). However, progress in
molecular analysis of specific T. denticola behaviors has
been considerably slowed by the limitations of currently
available genetic systems for this organism,
including
extremely low transformation efficiency, few selectable
markers (30), lack of reliable plasmid or other vectors for
the most studied strain (31, 32), and lack of promoter-
reporter
issues,
combined with the small number of researchers and the

systems. These significant

technical

relatively low level of funding in this field, are continuing
impediment to progress. This is reflected in the number of
journal articles published on oral spirochetes relative to
other periodontal pathogens. In 2010, approximately five
times as many papers were published on P. gingivalis than
were published on all oral
including
T. denticola, a ratio that has changed only slightly over
the past 15 years.

Interactions with host cells
Exposure of cultured cells of various types to T. denticola
(Fig. 1) results in: monolayer detachment and prolifera-
tion inhibition (3335), plasma membrane fibronectin
degradation (36), membrane blebbing, decreased inter-
cellular contact and cytoskeletal rearrangements (12, 35,
37), and loss of volume control (37). Most studies prior
to the advent of molecular cloning and genome sequen-
cing did not identify the specific T. denticola components
responsible for the observed cellular responses. One
example of a study that made some limited progress in
this regard is contained in a series of reports by Shenker
and coworkers on the antiproliferative effects of T.
denticola on fibroblasts and monocytes (33, 38, 39). In
these studies, certain protein fractions of T. denticola were
identified as containing the active agents, but
the
identities of the proteins have not yet been determined.

Studies over the past 15 years utilizing purified
proteins and isogenic T. denticola mutants have begun
the process of identifying specific molecular pathways
responsible for these rather complex cellular responses
and, in some cases, have identified host proteins inter-
acting with T. denticola effector proteins (Table 1). Two of
the most prominent and widely studied outer membrane
components of T. denticola are the major surface protein

(40).

Msp cytotoxicity is believed to be due to its demon-
strated pore-forming activity in both planar lipid bilayers
and in epithelial cell membranes (41, 42). This is
consistent with the demonstrated lytic pore-forming
activity of porins of other Gram-negative pathogens,
including Neisseria spp. (43, 44). Interestingly, fibroblasts
appear to be comparatively tolerant of Msp challenge,
making them more tractable candidates for analysis of
cellular responses. Studies by Ellen and coworkers have
demonstrated that Msp disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of
gingival fibroblasts, with specific effects, including dis-
ruption of actin stress fibers (45) and induction of de novo
synthesis of subcortical actin filaments (35, 37, 46, 47). A
specific peptide sequence within Msp has been shown to
promote stress fiber formation (48, 49). Concurrently,
and presumably related to this phenomenon, Msp blocks
the ability of fibroblasts to regulate intracellular calcium
gradients (50), which may contribute to the rather diverse
range of morphological responses observed. The mole-
cular mechanism of Msp-dependent calcium dysregula-
tion, including identification of cellular Msp receptor(s),
remains to be determined.

Dentilisin, a complex of three lipoproteins encoded by
the prcB-prcA-prtP locus, has a wide range of cytopathic
effects on whole cells and tissue. These effects are at least
primarily due to its potent proteolytic activity of denti-
lisin, although as in other spirochetes, lipid moieties of
the protease complex components may contribute to
activation of innate immune responses (51). In particular,
the ability of dentilisin activity to induce cell shrinkage
and increased permeability of intercellular junctions have
been shown to be a key factor in penetration and
translocation of T. denticola through cell monolayers
and ECM models (12, 13, 52). Further discussion of
dentilisin‚Äôs role in interaction with host proteins is found
in subsequent sections dealing with interactions with
specific host components.

T. denticola induces the production of various cyto-
kines, including interleukin-1√ü (IL-1√ü), IL-6, IL-8, and
TNF-a from various cell types (5356). The specific
T. denticola molecule(s) responsible have not yet been
clearly identified. On the other hand, two of these studies
(53, 55) also suggested that T. denticola hydrolyzes
IL-8. Using wild-type and prtP mutant T. denticola
strains, Miyamoto et al. showed that dentilisin activity

lated by proteolytic activity.

Interactions with ECM components
The ability to bind to or degrade ECM components is a
hallmark of numerous mucosal pathogens. In addition to
the direct tissue-destructive effects of ECM degradation,
there is increasing evidence that degradation products of
ECM components act as proinflammatory signals.

Fibronectin
Fibronectin is a dimeric, multidomain glycoprotein
bound to the surface of eukaryotic cells and is a key
component of
the ECM. The molecular differences
between the two major forms of FN (cellular FN and
plasma FN) are due to differential mRNA splicing, and
the two forms have distinct yet overlapping roles in
formation and maintenance of ECM and in pathways
of
tissue homeostasis (reviewed in (57)). Numerous
microbes, both commensal and pathogenic, exhibit FN-
binding activity as a prominent behavior important for
survival in the host environment. Molecular analysis of
FN-binding proteins of several pathogens continues to be
an important area of pathogenesis research over 30 years
after the seminal discovery of FN binding to Staphylo-
coccus aureus (58). Henderson et al. recently published an
extensive review of FN function and the mechanisms and
consequences of FN binding mediated by bacterial FN-
binding proteins (59). Although the importance of
T. denticola binding to FN has long been recognized, it
has been studied rather less than the interaction between
T. pallidum and FN. Due to the combination of the
genetic similarities between T. pallidum and T. denticola
and the complexities of working with T. pallidum, several
investigators have studied T. denticola both in terms of
periodontal pathogenicity and as a general model for
Treponemahost interactions (60). Several key studies by
the Ellen group beginning in the early 1990s established
the role of FN in T. denticola interaction with host tissue.
Dawson et al. characterized T. denticola binding to
immobilized FN and proposed that one or more
T. denticola FN-binding proteins were preferentially
localized at the tips of spirochete cells (61, 62). In some
strains, antiFN antibodies block T. denticola adherence
to FN, further supporting the specificity of the binding
interaction (63). Concurrent studies demonstrated the
ability of T. denticola to induce degradation of cellular
FN on gingival fibroblasts (36) and to induce cytoskeletal

rearrangements that may be the result of FN-mediated
signaling (37, 64, 65).

Although over 100 bacterial FN-binding proteins have
been reported, the level of knowledge of these proteins
and their interactions with FN vary widely. Detailed
information on the structure of complexes
formed
between the bacterial proteins and FN is available in
very few cases. In many instances, the only information
available is that a protein binds FN in an in vitro assay,
with or without information on kinetics, specificity, or
FN target domain (extensively reviewed in (59)). It is
rather common for bacteria to possess multiple distinct
FN-binding proteins. Both experimental and genetic
evidence suggests that T. denticola possesses at least two
and many as nine or more proteins with FN-binding
activity. Both Msp (22, 66, 67) and OppA (68) are
reported to bind immobilized FN. Edwards et al.
reported that Msp binds the N-terminal heparin I/fibrin
I domain of FN (66) that is the most commonly reported
target of bacterial FN-binding proteins. Although the
specific domain targeted by OppA is not known, it is of
interest
in ligand blotting experiments, both
wild-type and Msp mutant T. denticola cells bind the
same N-terminal FN domain (J.C. Fenno, unpublished
observations).

that

Because T. denticola and T. pallidum survive in
analogous mucosal environments and share many closely
homologous proteins, it is reasonable to hypothesize that
similar proteins might be involved in both microbes‚Äô
demonstrated FN-binding activity. Two of 10 potential
adhesins predicted by genomic analysis of T. pallidum
showed FN-binding activity when expressed in Escher-
ichia coli (69). One of these (TP0155) shows 45% identity
with T. denticola TDE2138, whereas the other (Tp0483) is
not homologous with any T. denticola protein. Like
TP0155, TDE2318, six other predicted T. denticola
proteins contain an M23 peptidase domain. Bamford et
al. recently reported recombinant expression and FN-
binding activity of
these seven T. denticola
predicted FN-binding proteins. Although immunofluor-
escence microscopy suggested surface localization of at
least one of the T. denticola proteins, three of the deduced
protein sequences lack predicted signal peptide sequences
and may not be secreted (70). It is not yet known whether
or under what conditions all of the genes encoding these
predicted FN-binding proteins are expressed. These

One issue in research into bacterialFN interactions is
the distinction between plasma and cellular FN. Many
studies of FN binding use plasma-derived FN (largely
due to its availability and price) when modeling behaviors
in which cellular FN may be more relevant. In the
simplest analysis, FN plays important roles in blood
clotting and wound healing, whereas cellular FN is

incorporated into the ECM as a part of a fibrillar matrix
(59) and is a target for bacterial adherence (59). However,
interaction of T. denticola with fibroblasts and related cell
types results in fragmentation and degradation of cellular
FN (36, 71), and the resulting fragments may have
modulatory effects on tissue homeostasis and inflamma-
tion (7274). In vitro studies showed that purified
dentilisin has the ability to degrade plasma FN (75)
and T. denticola challenge resulted in FN degradation in
fibroblasts (36), suggesting that dentilisin directly de-
grades cellular FN. However, Miao et al. reported that T.
denticola dentilisin did not directly degrade cellular FN
and that dentilisin induced MMP-2-dependent FN frag-
mentation in periodontal ligament cells. The MMP-2-
dependent FN fragmentation pattern induced by denti-
lisin activity resembles the FN fragmentation pattern
seen in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease
lesions. This suggests that the distinction between plasma
and cellular FN may be very important in terms of how
T. denticola and other oral microbes interact with this
protein that is essentially ubiquitous in the subgingival
environment.

Laminin and collagen
T. denticola is reported to bind laminin and collagen (62,
76, 77), and this has been proposed as a mechanism of
adherence to cells and ECM in the oral cavity. T.
denticola Msp (22, 66, 67) and OppA (68) bind laminin.
Recombinant Msp binds type I collagen (66), and Msp
blocks phagocytosis of collagen by fibroblasts (47). It is
not clear whether this last phenomenon is due to Msp
competing for collagen or to Msp disruption of fibroblast
membrane function. Dentilisin activity has been reported
to either directly degrade (75) or indirectly induce
degradation (78) of these substrates. The few in vitro
studies in the literature do not clearly establish the
biological role of T. denticola binding and degradation
of
these substrates. Further studies are required to
determine the significance of interactions of T. denticola
with these ECM components in the subgingival environ-
ment.

Glycosoaminoglycans
Hyaluronan (HA) is a high molecular weight glycosoa-
minoglycan prevalent in ECM and connective tissue. The
potential role of HA as a substrate for T. denticola
adherence is
supported by two studies employing
distinctly different approaches. Edwards et al. demon-
strated the ability of rMsp to bind to several immobilized
substrates including HA (66). Haapasalo et al. reported
T. denticola binding to immobilized HA and showed that
HA blocked binding of T. denticola to HA-coated beads
(79). Interestingly, inhibition of dentilisin activity also
blocked HA binding by T. denticola cells, suggesting a
role for dentilisin in HA binding. To date, these studies

have not been followed up by analysis of isogenic mutants
and purified native proteins.

Hyaluronidase-mediated degradation of HA increases
the permeability of connective tissues and decreases the
viscosity of body fluids (80). HA undergoes a high
turnover rate, and HA degradation products act as an
immune regulator, signaling through TLR2, TLR4, or
both TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages and dendritic cells
(81). Hyaluronidases of pathogenic Staphylococcus,
Streptococcus, and Clostridium spp.
(among others)
facilitate bacterial penetration through host tissues, and
cell-bound HA serves as an antigenic disguise that
prevents the recognition of bacteria by phagocytes (82).
The ability to bind HA is an obvious prerequisite for HA
degradation, and bacterial hyaluronidases generally also
have HA-binding activity, but T. denticola interaction
with HA has not yet been studied in detail. At least three
species of cultivable oral spirochetes, including T. denti-
cola produce a surface-expressed enzyme that hydrolyzes
both HA and chondroitin sulfate (83). The 59-kDa
enzyme purified from T. denticola (designated ‚ÄòHA/
CSase‚Äô) hydrolyzed both of these ECM glycosoaminogly-
cans. Scott et al. suggested that this enzyme could have an
active role in connective tissue degradation in periodontal
disease (83). Analysis of the T. denticola genome suggests
that this enzyme is encoded by TDE0471, predicted to
encode a lipoprotein with sialidase activity. The relation-
ship between this activity and the reported T. denticola
HA binding activity is not known. The single study
reporting HA binding also noted that there was no
significant attachment of T. denticola to chondroitin-4-
sulfate or dermatan sulfate (79).

Interactions with serum components

Nutrient acquisition
Routine growth of T. denticola requires serum supple-
mentation of the complex medium formulation (84).
Although a serum-free chemically defined medium has
been reported, to date it has only been used in a single
study of T. denticola fatty acid synthesis, primarily due to
the technical challenge of its formulation (85). As an
indication of the complexity of this medium, a commer-
cial supplier has quoted a closely related formulation
(OMIZ-P4 (86); ATCC Medium 2,131 (http://www.atc-
c.org)) at a price of well over US$1,000 per liter (J.C.
Fenno, personal communication). Growth of T. denticola
in a serum-containing medium is dependent on serum or
albumin concentration (87). SDS-PAGE analysis of
serum-containing culture medium during growth of
T. denticola shows dentilisin-dependent degradation of
albumin (J.C. Fenno, unpublished results).

Although T. denticola exhibits

some chemotactic
behavior toward glucose (88), it only weakly metabolizes
glucose while preferentially deriving energy from amino

acid fermentation (89). Consistent with its reliance on
amino acids and peptides as primary nutrients, the T.
denticola genome encodes eight ABC-type peptide uptake
systems (25), presumably with a variety of peptide
substrate specificities. To date, only one of these, encoded
by OppA-F, has been characterized (68). OppA, the
substrate binding protein of this system, is a 70-kDa
outer membrane lipoprotein that binds FN, laminin, and
plasminogen. The specific peptide substrate(s) taken up
through OppA-F have not been determined, and an
isogenic oppA mutant showed no defect in growth in
culture. Several toxic peptide analogs specific for parti-
cular peptide uptake systems were tested and showed no
difference in activity against wild-type and oppA mutant
T. denticola (68). These results are most likely a reflection of
the multiple redundant mechanisms of peptide acquisition
in this organism.

Among cultivable oral organisms, T. denticola and
members of the ‚Äòblack pigmented‚Äô Bacteroidetes, includ-
ing P. gingivalis produce the highest levels of hydrogen
sulfide (H2S)
(90), a cytotoxic compound found in
elevated levels in periodontal lesions (91). Metabolism
of glutathione by T. denticola produces H2S that is
believed to play a role in the host tissue destruction
seen in periodontitis (92). Recent work demonstrates that
H2S induces apoptosis in oral epithelial cells (93) as well
as gingival fibroblasts and periodontal
ligament cells
(94). In addition to the production of a toxic metabolite
from a host-supplied nutrient (glutathione), the enzyme
that catalyzes the final step in the glutathione metabolism
pathway is cystalyisin, a cysteine desulfhydrase that was
originally characterized due to its hemolytic activity (95).

Fibrinogen
The ability of bacterial pathogens to bind fibrinogen is
linked to pathogenic behavior of several bacterial species,
especially those such as staphylococci and streptococci
involved in endocarditis (96). Fibrinogen is a plasma
protein that is essential for wound healing and also plays
a role in tissue homeostasis (reviewed in (97)). Several
investigators have documented the ability of dentilisin
activity to hydrolyze fibrinogen (23, 98100) Bamford
et al. reported purification of
the native dentilisin
complex (CTLP) by fibrinogen affinity chromatography
(100). Although fibrinogen binding and degradation was
generally interpreted as an example of T. denticola
general proteolytic activity toward potential nutrients in
the host environment,
it was also recognized as a
potential virulence behavior that could contribute to the
dysregulation of
tissue homeostasis characteristic of
periodontal disease. Fibrinogen binding by the Msp in
both native and recombinant forms has been reported in
studies using T. denticola cells, native Msp, and recombi-
nant Msp (22, 66, 76). Although no studies have
reported the fibrinogen binding activity of msp-deficient

strongly imply that Msp is not the only fibrinogen-
binding protein of T. denticola (70). This study used
fibrinogen affinity chromatography to purify the native
dentilisin protease complex from T. denticola extracts and
subsequently demonstrated the hydrolytic activity of the
purified protease toward fibrinogen. T. denticola exhib-
ited saturable binding kinetics to soluble and immobilized
fibrinogen. Because T. denticola thrives in periodontal
lesions harboring damaged tissue, the ability to interact
with fibrinogen may contribute both to colonization and
environmental modulation by the spirochete.

Environmental signaling and chemotaxis
All microorganisms sense and respond to changes in their
environment, especially for purposes of nutrient acquisi-
tion. Studies of chemotaxis pathways have progressed in
T. denticola, both before and after publication of the
genome. Studies by Shi and others characterized chemo-
taxis-related gene expression (101, 102) and chemotactic
behavior toward potential nutrients (88) and the require-
ment for chemotaxis function for penetration of a model
epithelium (103). These studies confirmed the expected
important role of environmental sensing for this highly
motile organism. The mechanism of environmental sen-
sing typically involves one or more two-component
systems consisting of a sensor kinase and a response
regulator. A recent study characterized AtcS-AtcR, the
first growth phase-regulated two-component
system,
identified in the T. denticola genome sequence (104).
Expression of this system in T. denticola responds to
environmental conditions, and likely functions to regulate
expression of appropriate metabolic or biosynthetic
pathways as nutrients are depleted. This and other
signaling and regulatory systems are the subject of a
recent review by Frederick et al. (105). In another study
of potential
importance to environmental responses,
Gonzalez et al. (106) characterized the phosphoenolpyr-
uvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of T. denti-
cola. The authors reported that, because T. denticola
lacks PTS permeases normally utilized by bacteria for the
uptake of simple carbohydrates,
it is likely that the
Treponema phosphoryl-transfer chain has unique modes
of signal detection and sensory transmission. The role of
this phosphotransferase system in T. denticola metabo-
lism or environmental sensing remains unknown.

Modulation of host immune response pathways
Modulation of host innate immune response pathways
contributes to pathology of both chronic local infections
and life-threatening systemic inflammatory conditions
that may be induced or exacerbated by chronic bacterial
challenge (107). The early literature on innate and
acquired immune responses to oral spirochetes (reviewed
in (108)) contains limited analyses of effects of specific

Treponema denticola interactions with host proteins

antigens, and some apparently contradictory reports.
More recent work strongly implicates T. denticola outer
membrane protein, including the PrtP protease complex
(dentilisin) and Msp in these processes (53, 109, 110).
Cytopathic and immunomodulatory effects of
these
protein complexes are under study by several groups.
PrtP (dentilisin) is one of only two known lipoproteins in
the subtilase family, the other being SphB1, a subtilisin-
autotransporter that catalyzes maturation of the viru-
lence factor FhaB (filamentous hemagglutinin) at the
surface of Bordetella pertussis (111). The T. denticola
protease locus, including prcB, prcA, and prtP, is con-
served in several oral Treponema spp. (112114). Studies
with T. denticola mutants implicate PrtP protease activity
in modulation of complement regulatory protein Factor
H activity (115), activation of MMP-2 (71), and disrup-
tion of intercellular junctions (13). Studies with wild-type
strains suggest involvement of dentilisin in cell adherence
and cytotoxicity (40, 116), FN degradation (12, 36), and
modulation of
IL-8 expression (53). Both protein
complexes exhibit adhesin-like binding activities (22,
116118), induce cytoskeletal rearrangements, (12, 46)
and are cytotoxic to epithelial cells (12, 40). Msp (but not
PrtP) is hemolytic (40) and disrupts intracellular calcium
regulation (50). Msp disrupts cytoskeletal actin in both
gingival
fibroblasts and neutrophils (46, 119). PrtP
protease activity degrades ECM components as well as
IL-8 (53, 54), IL-1√ü, IL-6, TNF-a (120), and other
bioactive molecules involved in inflammatory vascular
responses (98, 121).

Resistance to serum killing
The ability of periodontal organisms to survive the
bactericidal activity present
in serum and gingival
crevicular fluid is suggestive of a specific mechanism of
complement resistance. Although some evidence supports
a role for the T. denticola surface protease dentilisin
(CTLP) in serum resistance, due to its ability to hydrolyze
a-chain of C3, producing iC3b (122), recent studies
implicate a Factor H-binding lipoprotein in this behavior
(115, 123). Because most spirochetal Factor H-binding
proteins are acylated but otherwise relatively uncon-
served, this work utilized a genome- and proteomics-
based approach to identify nine candidate genes encoding
small lipoproteins containing coiled-coil domains (123).
One of these (FhbB, encoded by TDE0108) bound Factor
H to the cell surface, and the greatly increased suscept-
ibility of an isogenic fhbB mutant to serum killing
indicates
for
T. denticola complement resistance (124). Interestingly,
the PrtP protease also plays a role in FhbB-mediated
Factor H binding. Factor H bound to the T. denticola
surface is cleaved by dentilisin activity to a size that
closely approximates FHL-1 (115). However, as there was
no difference in complement resistance between parent

that FhbB is primarily responsible

and prtP-deficient T. denticola strains (124), the precise
role of dentilisin in interaction with the complement
pathway remains to be determined.

Resistance to antimicrobial peptides
Antimicrobial peptides with a wide range of structure,
charge, and amino acid content comprise a significant
component of innate immunity. Several cell types asso-
ciated with mucosal surfaces produce small (B6-kDa)
cationic peptides, designated b-defensins (hBDs), that are
active against a wide range of microbes. Antimicrobial
activity of defensins is believed to be due to disruption of
the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, although the exact
mechanism of action remains somewhat controversial
(125). While defensin susceptibility of periodontal organ-
isms varies with the particular defensin molecule, bacter-
ial species and bacterial strain, Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacter-
ium nucleatum generally exhibit at least partial sensitivity
to hBDs 1, 2, or 3 (126). In contrast, Brissette et al.
reported that T. denticola is resistant to hBDs 2 and 3
(127), as are several oral Treponema spp. (128). The
mechanism of resistance is not yet understood, but
several mechanisms that contribute to resistance in other
organisms have been ruled out,
including dentilisin
proteolytic activity, ABC efflux transporters, and compe-
tition with other host proteins for binding sites (129).
Potential mechanisms of Treponema resistance to hBDs
include proton motive force-driven efflux and reduced
binding affinity due to absence of lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) on the outer membrane of the cell. In any case, this
striking insensitivity to killing effects of hBDs may
contribute to the abundance of treponemes in period-
ontal disease lesions.

Degradation of immunoglobulins
The ability to hydrolyze immunoglobulins is a potential
mechanism of evasion of adaptive immune responses.
Although a number of microbial pathogens possess
specific proteases with specific activity against immuno-
globulins, T. denticola‚Äôs ability to degrade immunoglobu-
lins in vivo has been somewhat controversial. While
dentilisin has demonstrated in vitro activity against IgG
(23, 130), Hollmann and Van der Hoeven reported that
intact T. denticola did not degrade IgA, IgG, or albumin
(131). It is reasonable to question these results in light of
the dentilisin studies and given the fact that serum
albumin is a preferred nutrient source of T. denticola (87).
In a recent study, Ishihara et al. characterized IdeT, a
T. denticola homolog of IdeS, that is an IgG-specific
streptococcal protease (132). The C-terminal domain of
the T. denticola protein (designated ‚Äòdentipain‚Äô) is a
protease that is cleaved and secreted into the extracellular
environment. An isogenic mutant strain in which the
dentipain domain was deleted was significantly less

virulent in a mouse abscess model, suggesting that IdeT
contributes to T. denticola virulence (133). Further studies
are required to characterize the role of IdeT in interaction
with immunoglobulins and other serum proteins in the
subgingival environment.

Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and lipoprotein effects
The T. denticola genome lacks an identifiable LPS
synthesis pathway (25). Biochemical analysis of
the
T. denticola outer membrane revealed the presence of a
novel glycolipid or lipooligosaccharide (LOS) that com-
prises the outer leaflet of the outer membrane bilayer
(134). This LOS, although similar in overall structure and
function to the lipopolysaccharide present on most
Gram-negative organisms, has a distinctly different
pattern of sugar molecules and lacks the lipid A
component of a typical LPS and is also biochemically
distinct from lipoteichoic acid. Classical LPS proinflam-
matory signaling is primarily through TLR4, with some
involvement of TLR2 in many cases. However,
in
spirochetes, many of which lack LPS,
lipoprotein-
mediated signaling through TLR2 is a primary activator
of inflammatory responses (51, 135). Rosen et al. reported
activation of murine macrophages by both LOS and de-
lipidated lipoproteins of T. denticola (56), but did not
identify signaling pathways involved. Recently, the same
group reported that LOS induced macrophage responses
through a TLR4-MyD88 pathway, whereas the major
outer membrane protein Msp induced innate immune
responses through TLR2-MyD88 (136). It should be
noted that Msp is not acylated, so the mechanism of
activation may be distinct in this case. In closely related
treponemes, T. maltophilum LOS activation of NF-kB
was reported to be dependent on TLR2, while both TLR2
and TLR4 were involved in activation of innate immune
responses to T. brennaborense LOS (137, 138). Other
recent studies focused on downstream effects of likely
TLR-mediated signaling events. Choi et al. reported that
T. denticola LOS induced osteoclastogenesis and MMP-9
expression in cultured murine osteoblasts and suggested
that these processes may be contributory mechanisms to
bone loss associated with periodontal diseases (139). A
similar study that focused on gingival fibroblasts reported
significantly increased MCP-1, IL-8, PGE2, and MMP-3
in LOS-challenged fibroblasts.

Summary
Treponema denticola, the most readily cultivable oral
spirochete,
is the model organism for the study of
spirochetehost interactions in periodontal disease. Re-
search in recent years has greatly expanded our under-
standing of both the biology of spirochetes and the
mechanisms utilized by these opportunistic commensal
pathogens to both survive as members of the ‚Äònormal‚Äô
oral flora as well as to participate in the induction of

periodontal tissue destruction and thrive in the resulting
environment. Numerous potentially pathogenic behaviors
and potential virulence factors were identified for some of
these behaviors, but it is rather striking that two multi-
functional outer membrane protein complexes were
reported to both directly and indirectly mediate cellular
damage participate in many of the identified pathogenic
behaviors of this organism. The surface-expressed PrtP
lipoprotein protease complex (dentilisin) and the oligo-
meric Msp are among the most studied T. denticola
virulence determinants. While this may overshadow the
potential importance of other as yet poorly documented
behaviors, it is evident that Msp and dentilisin are key
players in T. denticola periodontal pathogenicity. Besides
functioning in nutrient acquisition, dentilisin contributes
to tissue penetration and cleaves several proteins involved
in innate and adaptive immunity, likely favoring dysre-
gulation of tissue homeostasis. Expression of dentilisin is
required for native expression of
the major surface
protein (Msp) that binds FN, has cytotoxic pore-forming
activity, and disrupts intracellular calcium responses.
A deeper understanding of the roles of these and other
T. denticola proteins in microbehost interactions re-
quires taking advantage of recent advances in spirochete
molecular biology to analyze their cytopathic and
immunomodulatory behaviors.
