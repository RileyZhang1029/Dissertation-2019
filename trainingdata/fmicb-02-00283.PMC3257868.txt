Radioimmunotherapy is the targeted delivery of cytocidal radiation to cells via speciﬁc
antibody. Although mature for the treatment of cancer, RIT of infectious diseases is in pre-
clinical development. However, as there is an obvious and urgent need for novel approaches
to treat infectious diseases, RIT can provide us with a powerful approach to combat serious
diseases, including invasive fungal infections. For example, RIT has proven more effec-
tive than standard amphotericin B for the treatment of experimental cryptococcosis. This
review will discuss the concepts of RIT, its applications for infectious diseases, and the
strides made to date to bring RIT of infectious diseases to fruition. Finally, we will discuss
the potential of PAN-FUNGAL RIT, the targeting of conserved fungal cell surface antigens
by RIT, as a treatment modality for fungi prior to the formal microbiological identiﬁcation of
the speciﬁc pathogen. In sum, RIT provides a mechanism for the targeted killing of drug
susceptible or resistant fungi irrespective of the host immune status and may dramatically
reduce the length of therapy currently required for many invasive fungal diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Fungal diseases are increasingly common major causes of human
disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals and hos-
pitalized patients with underlying medical conditions (Patterson,
2005; Caston-Osorio et al., 2008; Richardson and Lass-Florl, 2008;
Pfaller and Diekema, 2010). In fact, since 1979 there has been a
>200% increase in the annual number of cases of invasive fun-
gal infections (IFI) in the United States. IFIs rates have risen
in large part due enhanced interventions in intensive care units
(ICUs), increased survival rates of individuals with immunodeﬁ-
ciencies, and the increased administration of potent therapeutics,
chemotherapeutics, and biologicals, that compromise the immune
responses of our patients. This increase is best exempliﬁed by the
example of Candida spp.: Candida were once infrequent causes
of invasive disease, whereas they are currently the fourth leading
cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection in the United States,
responsible for 8–15% of all such hospital acquired infections.
However, despite the increased prevalence of many mycotic dis-
eases, there remains an enormous gap in knowledge and our
current therapeutic armamentarium all too often fails to eradicate
these insidious pathogens.

Although they have powerful activities, the number of avail-
able medications for mycoses is signiﬁcantly less than for bac-
terial diseases. At present, there are three main medication cat-
egories for IFI: azoles (ﬂuconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,
and posaconazole), polyenes (primarily formulations of ampho-
tericin B), and echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and

anidulafungin). Notably, both the azoles and polyenes target
cell membrane sterols, with azoles inhibiting sterol synthesis
and the polyenes purportedly disrupting the membrane struc-
ture. The echinocandins inhibit cell wall production by interfer-
ing with beta-1,3-glucan synthesis. In addition to these drugs,
ﬂucytosine, an antimetabolite, is utilized primarily in combina-
tion with amphotericin B for the treatment of cryptococcosis.
Notably, the echinocandins are the last new class of antifun-
gal drug, with caspofungin gaining FDA approval in by the
FDA in 2001. Unfortunately, there is no antifungal medica-
tion poised to enter clinical medicine for the foreseeable future.
Hence, there is a consensus that new approaches are needed to
combat IFI.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses antigen–antibody interac-
tions to deliver cytocidal amounts of ionizing radiation to speciﬁc
cell targets. Currently, RIT is clinically utilized in the treatment
of primary, refractory, and recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma
using the radiolabeled mAbs Zevalin® and Bexxar®. It is impor-
tant to note that RIT offers several signiﬁcant advantages over
standard antifungal therapy. Firstly, RIT delivers lethal radiation,
such that it does not merely interfere with a single cellular path-
way but completely destroys targeted cells. As such, RIT is less
subject to drug resistance mechanisms. Moreover, RIT is cidal
in immunologically compromised individuals as the nuclides are
equally able to destroy cell targets in immunologically intact indi-
viduals or those with HIV or other immunodeﬁciencies, either
primary or drug induced. RIT does not suffer the drug–drug

interactions that clinically trouble clinicians caring for complex
patients, such as azole or echinocandin interactions with com-
monly prescribed immunosuppressive drugs, like cyclosporine or
tacrolimus. Finally, in contrast to weeks, months, or years required
for the treatment of certain mycoses with standard antifungals, RIT
may permit single dose or a limited number of doses to combat
fungal diseases.

What are the barriers for translating RIT into treatment
approaches for infectious diseases? Cell surface antigens are well
deﬁned for diverse pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, par-
asites, and fungi. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies exist that
target microbial cell surface antigens. Additionally, the technol-
ogy for linking radionuclides to mAbs is well established, so the
approaches can be readily translated from oncology into infec-
tious diseases. Additionally, the US hospitals that are now regularly
using RIT to treating cancer patients are fully equipped for initi-
ating Infectious Diseases RIT. Included in this ability, imaging
of patients receiving RIT to ascertain the targeting of radiola-
beled mAbs in Infectious Diseases RIT can be readily achieved
using portable imaging equipment that is standard in these hos-
pitals. Hence, the time is “now” for developing RIT to combat
IFI.

RIT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Our laboratories were the ﬁrst to demonstrate that microorganism-
speciﬁc mAb-RIT is highly effective for the treatment of exper-
imental fungal, bacterial, and viral infections, as well as virally
induced cancers (Table 1). Although the initial RIT work utilized
Cryptococcus neoformans for proof-of-principle studies in 2003
(Dadachova et al., 2003), RIT of bacterial and viral pathogens also
has rapidly progressed. In 2004, we established the feasibility of
RIT for invasive bacterial infection using a mouse pneumococcal
disease model (Dadachova et al., 2004a). An IgM isotype mAb
to serotype 8 Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide
was conjugated to the alpha-particle emitter Bismuth-213 (213Bi)
and we showed that an 80-μCi dose was sufﬁcient to protect 60%
of animals from an otherwise lethal challenge. More recently, in
2009, mAbs to the protective or lethal antigens of Bacillus anthracis
labeled with either 213Bi or the beta-particle emitter rhenium-188
(188Re) were shown to prolong the survival of mice infected with B.
anthracis Stern bacterial cells, but not spores (Rivera et al., 2009).

Treatment with 213Bi was more effective than when less powerful
beta-particles were used.

In 2006, HIV infected cells were found to be effectively tar-
geted by RIT (Dadachova et al., 2006a). Radiolabeling of antibody
to the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 with 213Bi
or 188Re selectively killed HIV infected cells in vitro and elimi-
nated the majority of HIV infected cells injected into SCID mice.
Notably, the mAb to gp41 is fully human. It is possible that, used
in combination with anti-retroviral drugs, that RIT may provide
a means to eradicate HIV infection (Casadevall et al., 2007). RIT
has also proven to be highly effective in the treatment of virally
induced cancers (Dadachova et al., 2007). Using a human papillo-
mavirus (HPV) type 16-associated cervical cancer model in mice,
RIT with a human mAb targeting the HPV16 E6 antigen signif-
icantly impeded tumor growth compared to cancers in control
animals (Wang et al., 2007). Interestingly, RIT targeting cancer cells
expressing low levels of HPV16 E6 was also successful (Phaeton
et al., 2010a). Furthermore, pre-treatment of the cervical tumors
with a proteosome inhibitor, MG-132, and unlabeled antibody
to E6 resulted in an increase in the levels of E6 for targeting by
188Re-labeled mAb and enhanced the efﬁcacy of RIT (Phaeton
et al., 2010b). These studies also suggest that RIT could potentially
eradicate infected cells prior to their malignant transformation.
In addition to cervical cancer, RIT proof-of-principle experiments
with HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma sug-
gest that this modality may be effective for this difﬁcult to combat
disease (Harris et al., 2011).

RIT OF CRYPTOCOCCOSIS
Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast-like encapsulated fungus with a
global distribution that is responsible for ∼600,000 deaths annu-
ally (Park et al., 2009), particularly in individuals with HIV infec-
tion. As noted above, the ﬁrst RIT experiments published in 2003
utilized C. neoformans as a model organism (Dadachova et al.,
2003). The initial studies with C. neoformans demonstrated that a
mAb speciﬁc for glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major com-
ponent of the pathogen’s polysaccharide capsule, radiolabeled with
either 213Bi or 188Re efﬁciently killed cryptococcal cells in vitro and
signiﬁcantly reduced fungal burdens in and prolonged the survival
of lethally infected mice (Dadachova et al., 2003). Most impres-
sively, 60% of infected mice treated with 100 μCi 213Bi were alive at

day 75 after RIT. Importantly, systemically infected mice tolerated
activities of up to 150 μCi of mAb labeled with either nuclide with
platelet counts normalizing by 14 days post-treatment (Dadachova
et al., 2004b). The reduction in platelets in the infected mice was
similar to that seen in the setting of cancer therapy (Sharkey et al.,
1997; Behr et al., 1999). Additionally, these mice had no evidence
of pulmonary ﬁbrosis 5 months after receiving RIT. The lack of
severe toxicities due to radiation in the mice with cryptococco-
sis treated with RIT is presumably due to the high speciﬁcity of
the mAb.

Chemotherapy for severe cryptococcosis is based on the admin-
istration of amphotericin B. However, RIT was recently shown to
be more effective than amphotericin B for the treatment of dissem-
inated cryptococcosis (Bryan et al., 2010). In the murine model
examined, amphotericin B was able to prolong survival, but fungal
burdens were not signiﬁcantly reduced. In contrast, RIT signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the fungal burdens in the tissues examined, regard-
less of the melanization state of the yeast cell. This is an important
observation as C. neoformans can produce melanin along the yeast
cell wall and this pigment can protect the fungus from injury from
external radiation (Nosanchuk and Casadevall, 2006; Dadachova
et al., 2008). Interestingly, ∼10 times less mAb 18B7 conjugated to
213Bi was required for killing melanized C. neoformans yeast cells
than 188Re conjugated antibody (Bryan et al., 2010), demonstrat-
ing the superior penetrating power of the alpha-particle versus
the beta-particle emitter. Combining RIT with amphotericin B
was more effective than amphotericin B alone (Bryan et al., 2010).
However, combination therapy was less potent than RIT alone if
melanized fungal cells were used for the infectious challenge. It is
not clear whether this result is due to the potential toxicities of
the amphotericin or the inﬂammatory responses that are induced
upon infection with melanized yeast cells (Mednick et al., 2005).
Although drug resistance is a concern in the treatment of fun-
gal infections, there is no literature on pathogen resistance to RIT.
Nevertheless, experiments have been performed to assess whether
resistance can develop (Bryan et al., 2009). C. neoformans yeast
cells were harvested from infected mice that received RIT and sub-
jected to treatment with 213Bi or 188Re conjugated mAbs. Notably,
the RIT and radiation naive C. neoformans yeast cells were similarly
radiosensitive to the radiolabeled mAbs. Additionally, no differ-
ences in survival occurred comparing mice infected with RIT C.
neoformans to radiation naive yeast cells.

FIGURE 1 | Proposed mechanism of RIT. (A) “Direct hit,” where emitted
particles kills the cell bound by radiolabeled antibody. (B) “Cross-ﬁre,”
where emitted particles kill cells distant from the cell bound by radiolabeled
antibody. Image is epithelial tissue infected with Candida parapsilosis.

Certain mechanisms of radiation effects on fungi have been
studied using C. neoformans. C. neoformans yeast cells can be
directly killed by gamma, beta, and alpha radiation in a dose and
time dependent manner (Bryan et al., 2008). Notably, although
membrane permeability did occur, it does not appear to be the
primary cause of death. Gamma radiation induced signiﬁcantly
more membrane disruption than either beta or alpha radiation. All
forms of radiation induced cellular apoptosis, although external
gamma radiation and 188Re-labeled antibody induced more apop-
tosis than 213Bi-labeled antibody. However, 213Bi-labeled antibody
signiﬁcantly reduced the metabolic activity of the yeast cells,
whereas the other forms of radiation did not. Hence, the cellu-
lar effects of radiation on yeast are dependent on dose and time as
well as the form of radiation administered. In a more recent study,
gamma radiation, as well as UV and visible light, were shown to
affect ATP levels in C. neoformans yeast cells, and this effect was
more pronounced in melanized compared to non-melanized cells
(Bryan et al., 2011a). Another study assessed whether“direct hit”or
“cross-ﬁre”predominated in the killing of C. neoformans yeast cells
(Dadachova et al., 2006b). As expected, given the power of alpha
radiation, 213Bi-labeled antibody resulted in signiﬁcant “direct hit”
killing. However, 213Bi-labeled antibody bound to heat-killed yeast
cells also led to“cross-ﬁre”fungicidal effects. In contrast, the killing
with the lower energy beta-particles produced by the 188Re-labeled
antibody was primarily due to “cross-ﬁre.”

MECHANISM
Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, there
are major radiobiological probabilities for the effectiveness of RIT.
The ﬁrst and most targeted effect occurs by a “direct hit,” when the
radiolabeled antibody binds to a cell and the emitted particles kill
the cell (Figure 1A). However,“cross-ﬁre”effects, killing of a cell by
particles emitted from a radiolabeled antibody bound to a distant
cell, can be equally efﬁcient (Figure 1B). Both of these mechanisms
lead to cell apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution (Macklis, 2004).
It is also highly probable, that a radiolabeled antibody could kill
by both of these processes. Notably, the “cross-ﬁre” mechanism
would be expected to play a large role in combating fungal bioﬁlm
diseases or situations where some fungi are extracellular, whilst
others are intracellular.

RIT TOXICITIES
As brieﬂy described above, the primary toxicity identiﬁed in our
RIT experiments is a modest thrombocytopenia that resolves
within 14 days post therapy, which is similar to that seen in RIT
in cancer patients (Macklis and Pohlman, 2006). Importantly,
thrombocytopenia prediction models are developed for RIT and
dose-fractionated RIT strategies can be implemented to minimize
the nadir and duration of the thrombocytopenia (Shen et al.,
2002). Importantly, since microbial cells in otherwise sterile sites
are foreign to hosts, the microbes display antigens that are dis-
tinct from those expressed by host cells. These distinct microbial
antigens are the primary targets for infectious diseases RIT. In
contrast, RIT of cancers targets tumor-associated antigens that
are also expressed on normal cells, which clearly increases toxicity

risks. Therefore, in addition to leading to a theoretically higher
therapeutic index in infectious diseases RIT relative to that for
cancer, RIT of infectious diseases should have a lower toxicity risk
than RIT for cancer.

There is an important issue of “free antigen” as pathogens
release/secrete many substances,
including proteins, carbohy-
drates, and lipids. Hence, antibody directed to released or poten-
tially secreted antigen has the potential to produce off-target
effects. Previously, we have studied this issue in murine crypto-
coccosis, since C. neoformans releases large amounts of capsular
polysaccharide and we were concerned that the radiolabeled anti-
body to the capsule would interact with non-organism associated
polysaccharide. However, we determined that radiolabeled anti-
body had higher afﬁnity for mice-associated polysaccharide than
for its soluble form (Dadachova et al., 2003). Nevertheless, unla-
beled antibody can be administered prior to RIT in order to
potentially clear circulating antigens.

BIOFILMS
Bioﬁlms are complex communities of pathogens that adhere to
one another and are typically surrounded by a matrix of extracel-
lular materials, particularly exopolysaccharides. Fungal bioﬁlms
can be especially tenacious and can exacerbate disease by lead-
ing to increased drug resistance or enhanced adherence to foreign
bodies or tissues. RIT using mAb to C. neoformans GXM conju-
gated to 213Bi can effectively damage cryptococcal bioﬁlms (50%
reduction in metabolic activity; Martinez et al., 2006). Notably,
beta and gamma forms of radiation did not have a signiﬁcant
effect on the fungal bioﬁlms. It was not determined whether RIT
of bioﬁlms synergized with antifungal drugs, as the alterations in
bioﬁlm could enhance drug penetration facilitating the activities
of the drugs on fungal cells. Hence, RIT may be a means for com-
bating fungal bioﬁlms with or without concomitant antifungal
drugs.

CONCEPT OF PAN-FUNGAL RIT
To dramatically drive the treatment of infectious diseases for-
ward with RIT, we need to make a “quantum leap” by identifying
antigens shared by major IFI-causing pathogens (PAN-FUNGAL
antigens) in order to deliver RIT without the need for speciﬁc
mycological diagnosis or fear of drug resistance. To this end, we
have been exploring the possibility of targeting common cell wall
associated antigens, which also happen to constitute major viru-
lence factors for these fungi. We have begun exploring the utility
of four cell surface antigens. The majority of fungal cells, yeast,
and hyphal, display beta-glucans on their cell surface and Cas-
sone and colleagues have generated a mAb to beta-glucan that
provides signiﬁcant protection against Candida albicans, C. neo-
formans, and Aspergillus fumigatus in animal models if given prior
to infection (Torosantucci et al., 2005, 2009; Rachini et al., 2007).
Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) is a key regulator of virulence in
Histoplasma capsulatum and mAbs directed to this protein are pro-
tective in murine histoplasmosis (Guimaraes et al., 2009). Recently,
we demonstrated that mAbs to H. capsulatum Hsp60 also bound
other pathogenic fungal species (Bryan et al., 2011b), but does
not react with human Hsp60 (Guimaraes et al., 2009). Melanin
is present in the cell wall of diverse human fungal pathogens

and a monoclonal to fungal melanin has been shown to bind C.
neoformans, H. capsulatum, Aspergillus spp., C. albicans, Scytalid-
ium dimidiatum, Sporothrix schenckii, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis,
Coccidioides posadasii, and Blastomyces dermatitidis (reviewed in
Nosanchuk and Casadevall, 2006; Taborda et al., 2008). Glucosyl-
ceramide is another common exposed cell surface antigen on fungi
and a mAb to glucosylceramide has been shown to bind glucosyl-
ceramide in C. neoformans and C. albicans, but not mammalian
glucosylceramide (Rhome et al., 2011).

Selected mAbs to these four surface antigens were used for
radiolabeling and tested for their capacity to kill C. neoformans
and C. albicans (Bryan et al., 2011b). 213Bi-labeled >90% of
mAbs 2G8, IgG2b to beta-galactan, and 4E12, IgG2a to Hsp60,
but the labeling efﬁciency of mAb 6D2, IgM to melanin, was only
30%. 213Bi did not effectively label mAb B11, IgM to glucosylce-
ramide, but the mAb was labeled by 188Re. Radiolabeled mAb to
beta-glucan killed 100% of C. neoformans yeast cells, whereas C.
albicans pseudohyphal cells were signiﬁcantly more resistant as the
treatment produced a 30% reduction in CFUs. Targeting Hsp60
produced > 90% reductions in CFUs of both C. neoformans and
C. albicans. The poor 213Bi radiolabeling of the mAb to melanin
resulted in the delivery of three to four times less radiation than
the 213Bi-labeled mAbs to beta-glucan and Hsp60, and ∼4 μCi/5
million yeast cells was the maximal radiation delivered resulting
in only 15 and 22% reduction for C. albicans and C. neoformans,
respectively, but the decrease was only signiﬁcant for C. neofor-
mans. The 188Re-labeled mAb to glucosylceramide decreased the
CFU of C. neoformans by 40%. Hence, we have demonstrated that
we can radiolabel diverse antibodies to distinct conserved sur-
face antigens and deliver cytocidal radiation to important fungal
pathogens by RIT. It is noteworthy that the efﬁcacy of killing was
achieved with signiﬁcantly lower (∼1,000 times) concentrations
than were required for biological efﬁcacy with unlabeled antibody,
such as with mAb 2G8 (Torosantucci et al., 2009). Moreover, the
data demonstrated that the powerful alpha particles from 213Bi
efﬁciently killed fungal cells even when there were relatively few
binding sites on their cell surface (∼5% mAb binding). Additional
experimentation is required to develop more efﬁcient labeling of
IgM isotype mAbs and perhaps improve the labeling of IgG isotype
mAbs. Nevertheless, the PAN-FUNGAL concept is validated by
these proof-of-principle experiments and further study is clearly
warranted.

DISCUSSION
The drive to develop RIT of infectious diseases is fueled by the
facts that (1) our current antifungal armamentarium often fails
to eradicate IFI, (2) the last new category of antifungals was FDA
approved in 2001, (3) no new antifungal drugs are close to clinical
availability, and (4) RIT is a means to speciﬁcally target microbes in
a cytocidal manner, irrespective of the host immune status, current
drug regimen, or potential resistance mechanisms of the microbe.
With RIT of fungi, especially with PAN-FUNGAL RIT, we can
potentially reduce treatment durations, prevent the toxicities of
the prolonged administration of (possibly ineffective) antifungals,
minimize concerns of drug–drug interactions, permit the preser-
vation of current immunomodulating medications (i.e., for trans-
plant patients), and eliminate the need for a speciﬁc mycological

diagnosis. Given the well developed applications of RIT in Oncol-
ogy, the barriers to initiating RIT for infectious diseases, especially
IFIs that continue to have unacceptably high mortality rates, are
indeed surmountable. The work to date demonstrates that we have
in hand a diverse set of speciﬁc mAbs and mAbs with reactivity to
several leading fungal pathogens that can be harnessed for RIT. We
are hopeful that the upcoming years will see a broader acceptance
of this approach and a rapid growth in pre-clinical work that will

allow the translation of RIT from the basic science laboratory to
our patients.
