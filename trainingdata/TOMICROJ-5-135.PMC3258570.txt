Abstract:  This  review  focuses  on  the  burden  of  respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV)  infection  in  preterm  infants  with  and 
without chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD). The year-to-year and seasonal variations in RSV activ-
ity are key aspects of RSV epidemiology, and knowledge/monitoring of local RSV activity is mandatory for guidance of 
prophylaxis  with  the  monoclonal  antibodies  palivizumab  and  in  the  near  future  motavizumab.  Morbidity  expressed  in 
rates of hospitalizations attributable to RSV illness revealed a mean of 10 percent in preterm infants without and 19 per-
cent (p=0.016) with BPD. Mortality rates diverged widely, and case fatality rates have been reported to range from 0 to 12 
percent.  The  typical  clinical  picture  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  is  not  different  in  term  and  preterm  infants,  but 
rates of apnoeas are significantly increased in preterms, ranging from 4.9 to 37.5 percent with decreasing rates observed in 
more  recent  studies.  Until  a  RSV  vaccine  is  developed  and  will  be  available,  prophylaxis  with  palivizumab  is  the  only 
preventative strategy other than hand hygiene and contact measures that significantly reduces RSV hospitalization rates in 
preterm infants both with and without BPD.  

Keywords: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, monoclonal antibodies, palivizumab, preterms, preventative strategy. 

INTRODUCTION 

  Respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV)  is  the  most  important 
cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and chil-
dren. Fifty to 90 percent of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis, 
5 to 40 percent of those for pneumonia, and 10 to 30 percent 
of  those  for  tracheobronchitis  are  caused  by  RSV  [1].  Sub-
stantial increases in the number of admissions for RSV bron-
chiolitis  (up  to  126.300  hospitalizations  and  500  deaths  an-
nually)  have  been  documented  in  North  America  [2].  In 
Canada, inpatient care of RSV illness costs $ 18 million (US 
dollars) yearly, accounting for 62 percent of the total cost of 
this  disease  [1].  The  magnitude  of  the  costs  is  understand-
able,  since  virtually  all  children  become  infected  with  RSV 
within two years after birth, and one percent requires hospi-
talization [3].  

 
In  developed  countries,  there  are  well-defined  high-risk 
groups,  generally  with  chronic  underlying  disorders,  in 
whom  infection  with  RSV  is  more  likely  to  progress  into 
severe  lower-respiratory-tract  infections.  Healthy  infants 
younger than 3 months old are also susceptible to such infec-
tions.  High  risk  groups  for  severe  RSV  disease  include  in-
fants  below  six  months  of  age,  premature  infants  with  or 
without chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia – 
BPD),  infants  with  hemodynamically  significant  congenital 
heart disease (CHD), immunosuppressed patients (including

those  undergoing  chemotherapy,  bone-marrow  and  solid-
organ transplantation, and those with underlying disorders of 
cellular  immunity)  or  cystic  fibrosis,  and  infants  with  neu-
romuscular  diseases  [4-6].  There  is  no  particular  age-group 
that is not  at risk for  RSV infection, but  certain risk factors 
have  been  implicated  in  more  severe  disease:low  socioeco-
nomic status,  crowded  living  conditions,  exposure to  indoor 
smoke  pollution,  a  family  history  of  asthma  or  atopy,  and 
perhaps  infection with the A subgroup of RSV [4]. Preterm 
infants with or without  BPD  and infants with  CHD are also 
known  to  be  at  increased  risk  for  hospitalization  including 
admission  to  an  intensive  care  unit  (ICU),  ventilatory  sup-
port, or prolonged supplemental oxygen [7-9].  

  This  review  focuses  on  the  burden  of  RSV  disease  in 
preterm infants with and without BPD. 

SEASONAL  DISTRIBUTIONS  OF  RSV  RELATED 
HOSPITALIZATIONS OF PRETERM INFANTS  

  The year-to-year and seasonal variations in RSV activity 
are  key  aspects  of  RSV  epidemiology.  RSV  is  a  seasonal 
virus, with peak rates of infection occurring  annually  in the 
cold season in temperate climates, and in the rainy season, as 
temperatures  fall,  in  tropical  climates  [4].  Among  Europe 
RSV  related  re-hospitalizations  of  preterm  infants  show  a 
seasonal  distribution  mainly  during  the  winter  and  spring 
months ranging from October to May, and peaking between 
December/January  and  March  [9-14].  The  distribution  of 
hospitalizations  and  ICU  admissions  related  to  confirmed 
RSV  infection  throughout  the  study  period  (IRIS  study) 
peaked in December and January [14] and the distribution of 
RSV  related  re-hospitalizations  in  the  Munich  RSV  Study

extended  from  October  to  May,  with  29  cases  (75.7%)  oc-
curring between January and March [10]. The Austrian RSV 
29-32  Study  Group  including  863  infants  aged  29  to  32 
weeks  of  gestational  age  revealed  18%  of  RSV  related  re-
hospitalizations  occurring  outside  the  typical  RSV  season 
[11]. An even higher rate has been reported by Duppenthaler 
et al., [15] during the 1999/2000 RSV season in Switzerland 
with  36%  of  hospitalisations  occurring  after  April  1,  2000 
that  would  not  have  been  preventable  by  palivizumab  pro-
phylaxis  initiated  in  November  1.  Overall  there  are  major 
differences  between  regions  throughout  the  northern  hemi-
sphere  [16-22].  In  the  southern  hemisphere,  for  example  in 
Gambia,  RSV  activity  peaked  during  the  summer  months 
between August and September over a 4-year (1993 – 1996) 
period [23].  

  Thus,  knowledge  about  local  RSV  epidemics  is  manda-
tory  for  targeted  prophylaxis  with  palivizumab  in  high-risk

infants. In Austria an epidemiological monitoring system has 
been  established  in  2002  called  RSV-hotline  incorporating 
data of  infants hospitalized due  to  RSV disease  that  are en-
tered  into  the  system  voluntarily  by  Austrian  pediatricians 
(https://hc4you.hcsolutions.at/rsv).  The  seasonal  distribu-
tions of RSV attributed hospitalizations of preterm infants in 
Austria over the seasons 1998 to 2001 and 2001 to 2003 are 
shown in Fig. (1a, b), respectively [11, 24]. 

CLINICAL  FEATURES  OF  RSV  INFECTION  IN 
PRETERM INFANTS 

  The  most  common  infection  caused  by  RSV  is  of  the 
upper  respiratory  tract;  such  infections  are  characterised  by 
rhinitis,  cough, and sometimes fever. Acute otitis media oc-
curs in up to a third of children with RSV illness; both RSV 
and  bacterial  pathogens  have  been  isolated  from  the  middle 
ears of children with  RSV.  Croup also occurs with RSV in-

fection,  but  bronchiolitis  and  pneumonia  are  the  most  com-
mon  manifestations  in  children.  Signs  of  upper-respiratory-
tract involvement commonly precede those of the lower res-
piratory tract by a few days, and fever, when present, is usu-
ally  low  grade.  Dyspnoea,  lower  chest-wall  indrawing,  and 
difficulty  in  feeding  characterise  lower-respiratory-tract  in-
fection.  In  bronchiolitis,  wheeze  may  be  audible  with  or 
without a stethoscope, and a prolonged expiratory phase and 
crackles  are  characteristic.  Air  trapping  results  in  very  fast 
breathing and a palpable liver and spleen. The typical radio-
graphic  pattern  includes  hyperinflation  with  diffuse  intersti-
tial  markings  and  peribronchial 
thickening.  Segmental 
atelectasis, which usually clears spontaneously, is often seen. 
Children  with  pneumonia,  on  the  other  hand,  have  fine 
crackles and a radiographic pattern of alveolar, segmental, or 
lobar consolidation.  

 
Severe bronchiolitis may lead to acute respiratory failure 
associated  with  severe  bronchospasm,  moderate  to  severe 
hypoxia,  and  carbon  dioxide  retention.  With  lung  function 
tests  [25]  two  patterns  of  severe  disease  are  seen:  in  about 
two-thirds of cases there is obstructive small airways disease 
(bronchiolitis),  and  in  the  remainder  there  is  a  restrictive 
pattern (pneumonia). Most of the latter cases meet the crite-
ria  for  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome.  They  tend  to  be 
younger, have more predisposing underlying disease, and are 
ventilated  for  longer.  In  severely  ill  children,  complications 
include  pulmonary  hypertension  and  cardiovascular  com-
promise requiring inotropic support [26].  

  Although  bacterial  superinfection  is  rare  in  developed 
countries,  it  is  more  common  in  developing  countries.  This 
may partly explain the higher fatality rates seen in develop-
ing nations [4]. Over a five years period we observed a gen-
eral low total rate of bacterial co-infection of 1.9% excluding 
ICU patients [27]. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection 
in  preterm  infants  hospitalized  due  to  respiratory  syncytial 
virus infection was  three times higher compared  to term in-
fants (9.5 vs. 3.1%, p=0.017) and associated with prolonged 
hospitalisation and ICU admission). The predominant patho-
gens  were  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  and  Haemophilus  in-
fluenzae.  Mean length of stay in preterm infants with bacte-
rial co-infection was 22.3 days compared to 10.3 days with-
out bacterial co-infection (p < 0.006). 

  Apnoea  tends  to  occur  in  infants  under  2  months  of  age 
with atelectasia on chest radiography [28] and is common in 
those born prematurely. In cases of severe apnoea, mechani-
cal ventilation may be necessary, despite the absence of res-
piratory failure. The pathophysiology of this manifestation is 
unknown, but postulated mechanisms include the immaturity 
of the respiratory centre in the brain-stems of premature in-
fants,  and  RSV  associated  hypersensitivity  of  the  laryngeal 
chemoreceptors  [4].  In  a  recent  systematic  review  the  inci-
dence of apnoea including a study population of 5575 hospi-
talized patients with RSV ranged from a high of 23.8% to a 
low  of  1.2%  [29].  Comparison  of  the  cohort  by  term  and 
preterm  birth  revealed  an  expected  excess  in  apnoea  inci-
dence in preterms, even in the absence of information about 
chronologic age In detail, the authors cite five of seven stud-
ies  reporting  on  the  incidence  of  apnoea  with  significant 
rates comparing  term  to preterm  infants (range 0.5 – 12.4% 
compared to 4.9 – 37.5%, respectively, overall p<0.001), see 
Table  1  [29].  A  study  by  Gleeson  et  al.,  [30]  examined  the 

hypothesis  that dysregulation of mucosal  immune responses 
to  respiratory  infections  is  a  critical  event,  which  could  be 
causal  in  respiratory  arrest  of  some  previously  healthy  in-
fants. The salivary IgA and IgM concentrations in the appar-
ent  life  threatening  event  (ALTE)  infants  at  presentation  to 
hospital  indicated  that  a  significant  mucosal  immune  re-
sponse  had  already  occurred  with  nearly  60%  of  the  IgA 
concentrations  significantly  above  the  population-based  ref-
erence  ranges.  This  hyper-immune  response  was  most  evi-
dent in  the ALTE  infants with pathology evidence of an in-
fection; and the most prevalent pathogen identified was RSV 
(64%). The group compromised 26 infants with a gestational 
age ranging from 26 to 41 weeks at a median age of 60 days.

syncytial virus bronchiolitis: a systematic review. J Pediatr 2009; 155:728-33 [29]. 

  Encephalopathy  associated  with  respiratory  syncytial 
virus infection is not well recognized. Ng et al., [31] reported 
on an incidence of 1.8% in a total of 487 patients with respi-
ratory  syncytial  virus  bronchiolitis  studied  over  a  period  of 
four  years  with  seizures  being  the  presenting  complication. 
Interestingly,  three  of  the  nine  infants  showing  neurologic 
complications  had  a  history  of  prematurity  (27,  28,  and  31 
weeks of gestational age, respectively). 

  During a five-year period (1984 to 1989) Meert et al., [7] 
reported  on  484  previously  healthy  infants  (including  27% 
preterm  born)  admitted  to  the  hospital  with  RSV  infection. 
No  differences  were  found  in  the  presenting  symptoms  of 
respiratory distress, cough, fever or shock, although the pre-
term  group  was  more  likely  to  present  with  apnea  (13  vs. 
4%,  p<0.001).  Chest  roentgenograms  revealed  that  preterm 
infants  had  a  higher  incidence  of  atelectasis/infiltrate  and 
hyperinflation (47 vs. 36%, p<0.05, and 28 vs. 19%, p<0.05, 
respectively).  Preterm  infants  had  longer  hospital  stays 
(mean 5.4 vs. 3.6 days, p<0.001) as well as a higher Physiol-
ogic Stability Index and Therapeutic Intervention Score (6.4 
vs.  4.3,  p<0.001,  and  7.4  vs.  5.4,  p<0.001,  respectively). 
They were also more  likely  to receive supplemental oxygen 
(39 vs. 19%), ICU admission (13 vs. 4%), mechanical venti-
lation (12 vs. 2%), and nothing by mouth status (17 vs. 7 %, 
for  all  p<0.001,  respectively).  There  was  no  difference  in 
postnatal age (mean 5.5 vs. 5.1 months), but preterm infants 
had a younger postconceptual age (mean 3.9 vs. 5.0 months, 
p<0.05).

  The  37  preterm  infants  with  RSV  related  rehospitalisa-
tion of the Munich RSV study [10] presented with pneumo-
nia  with  and  without  clinical  signs  of  obstructive  bronchitis 
(27%);  obstructive  bronchitis,  bronchiolitis,  or  acute  bron-
chitis (67.6%) or acute upper airway infection (5.4%).  

MORBIDITY  AND  MORTALITY  DUE  TO  RSV  IN-
FECTION  IN  PRETERM  INFANTS  WITH  AND 
WITHOUT BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA 

Morbidity 

  The  risk  for  RSV  related  hospitalization  is  significantly 
increased in preterm  infants. In East Denmark the incidence 
of RSV infection requiring hospitalization among infants <6 
months  was  estimated  to  be  34/1000/season,  and  was 
32/1000/season  among  term  infants  and  66/1000/season 
among preterm infants (p<0.001) [8]. In Southern Austria we 
observed an  incidence of RSV infection requiring hospitali-
zation  of  6/1000/season  among  term  and  12/1000/season 
(p<0.05) among preterm infants [32]. 

  Why are preterm infants at increased risk for severe RSV 
lower  respiratory  tract  infection?  The  main  factors  include 
small  lung  volumes,  a  reduced  lung  surface  area,  small  air-
ways and an increased air space wall  thickness [33]. This  is 
reflected by the developmental stage of the fetal lungs show-
ing the canalicular period between 16 and 26 weeks followed 
by the saccular period from 26  to 36 weeks and  at  least the 
alveolar period from 36 to 41 weeks of gestational age. For 
example,  the  lung  volume  and  surface  area  of  a  term  are 
three  times  larger  compared  to  a  30  week  preterm  infant. 
Additionally, the airways of preterm infants have been venti-
lated  mechanically  and  been  suctioned  and  thus  been  dam-
aged  by  many  microtraumas  with  disruption  of  endothelial 
surfaces  enabling  pathogens  easier  to  invade.  At  least  the 
immune  system  of  preterm  infants  is  immature  resulting  in 
low  antibody  titers  (incomplete  diaplacentar  transfer  of  ma-
ternal  antibodies)  and  a  reduced  cellular  immunity  with  re-
duced virus clearance [34]. 

  Groothuis [35] first reported on the increased risk of pre-
term  infants  with  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia  (BPD)  for 
RSV related prolonged hospitalizations, high rates of admis-
sion  to  the  ICU  and  the  need  for  mechanical  ventilation. 
Early  data  from  the  PICNIC  study  group  including  twelve 
paediatric  tertiary care centers during the 1989 to 1990 sea-
son observed 12.6% of hospitalized infants with RSV infec-
tion having chronic  lung disease and 23.9% being born pre-
maturely  [36].  Another  data  from  the  PICNIC  study  group 
found  underlying  illnesses  including  chronic  lung  disease 
like  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia  significantly  associated 
with  prolonged  hospital  stay  attributable  to  RSV  compared 
with those who were premature or younger than 6 weeks of 
age on admission [37]. The proportion of infants with under-
lying  illness  was  22.6%  in  a  study  population  of  689  pa-
tients,  16%  were  admitted  to  ICU  and  9.1%  needed  me-
chanical  ventilation.  The  mortality  rates  varied  across  all 
groups, and the rate was 0.9% in the total study population 

 
Joffe  et  al., [38] reported on a median length of stay for 
RSV disease in preterm infants< 37 weeks gestational age of 
4 days. Infants who were discharged from the NICU and re-
hospitalized  during  the  same  RSV  season  tended  to  have 
longer  admissions  than  those  discharged  before  the  begin-

Resch et al. 

ning of the season, and they also required more days of oxy-
gen therapy, had a higher risk for ICU  admission, and were 
more  likely  to  require  mechanical  ventilation.  No  deaths 
were reported attributable to RSV. 

  The  Spain  case  control  study  (IRIS  study  group)  in  in-
fants of 33 to 35 weeks gestational age linked to RSV related 
hospitalization  (including  186  cases  and  371  controls)  re-
ported on a rate of 20.5% requiring ICU admission and 7.6% 
with need for mechanical ventilation [39]. During  the study 
period  no  deaths  were  observed.  Median  length  of  stay  in 
hospital  was  8  days  and  in  ICU  6  days.  The  IRIS  study  re-
ported on fifty-nine preterm  infants below 33 weeks of ges-
tational age being rehospitalized for RSV infection of whom 
15 (25.4%) required ICU admission for a median of 6 (range 
3  to  11) days  and  three  (5.1%)  mechanical  ventilation  for a 
median of 5 (range 7 to 43) days [14]. 

  During  a  prospective  study  on  infants  younger  than  24 
months  hospitalized  for  viral  upper  and  lower  respiratory 
tract  infection  between  November  1999  and  October  2000 
we found 58 of 281 (21%) infants included being RSV posi-
tive  by  antigen  detection  in  nasopharyngeal  aspirates  [9]. 
RSV positive infants were of younger age (mean 3.5  vs. 5.5 
months,  p=0.003),  had  a  higher  lower  respiratory  illness 
score (ranging from 0 to 5; mean 2.9  vs. 1.8, p<0.001), and 
had  more  days  of  hospitalization,  more  days  of  oxygen  
requirement,  and  more  days  of  respiratory  support  (all 
p<0.001, respectively). Comparison of RSV-positive U/LRTI 
of preterm with term infants showed differences only regard-
ing  days  of  hospitalization  (mean  14  vs  8.9;  p  =  0.007). 
Thus,  RSV  contributed  to  prolonged  hospitalizations  and 
more  severe  clinical  courses  of  disease  both  in  very  young 
term and preterm infants. 

  Of 151 children under 1 year of age admitted to the pae-
diatric  intensive care unit (PICU) of the  Trousseau Hospital 
in Paris from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2003 for man-
agement  of  bronchiolitis  caused  by  proven  RSV  infection 
and  requiring  mechanical  ventilation  14  infants  (9.1%) 
needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) sup-
port  [40].  The  frequency  of  BPD  was  significantly  higher 
amongst children who required ECMO support as compared 
with those from the group without ECMO support (p=0.001, 
OR =8.9; 95%CI=2.4–33.1).  

  The  rate  for  re-hospitalisation  due  to  acute  respiratory 
infection was 10.6% of 717 preterm infants (<35 weeks ges-
tational age) included in the Munich RSV study, and the risk 
for RSV related hospitalization was 5.2% during a one year 
observation  period  [10].  Preterm  infants  with  BPD  had  a 
probability of 24.5% for rehospitalisation due to acute respi-
ratory infection and of 15% for RSV related hospitalization. 
The following factors were independently associated with an 
increased  risk  of  RSV  related  hospitalization:  male  gender 
(adjusted  OR:  8.7;  95%  CI  2.6–29.1),  chronic  lung  disease 
(OR:  3.99;  95%CI:  1.4–11.2),  discharge  between  October 
and  December  (OR:  2.1;  95%CI:  0.99–4.4),  and  day-care 
attendance  of  siblings  (OR:  3.9;  95%CI:  1.9–8.3).  The  me-
dian  length  of  hospital  stay  was  8  days  (range  2–48  days). 
Thirty-one  infants  (83.7%)  were  treated  in  regular  pediatric 
wards,  whereas  six  infants  (16.2%)  required  intensive-care-
unit admission for a median duration of 6.5 days (range 4–8 
days). 

RSV and Prematurity 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5    139 

  Assessing  the  effect  of  prematurity  on  RSV  hospital  re-
source  use  and  outcomes  by  comparison  of  different  gesta-
tional age-groups (<33, 33 to 35, and 36 weeks, respectively) 
resulted  in  higher  intubation  rates  and  longer  stays  at  the 
hospital  and  the  ICU  in  infants  aged  33  to  35  weeks  [41]. 
Infants  36  weeks  gestational  age  had  outcomes  similar  to 
term  infants.  Another  study  focusing  on  complications  in 
infants  hospitalized  for  RSV  disease  interestingly  showed 
former  preterm  infants  of  33  to  35  weeks  gestational  age 
having the highest rates of complications (93%), the longest 
mean  hospital  stay  of  7.4  days  and  the  highest  costs  out  of 
the group with a history of prematurity [42].

  Table  2  summarizes 
re-
hospitalization rates as a  marker of severe  RSV  infection in 
preterm  infants  without  BPD  [10-14,24,38,39,43-52],  and 
Table  3  those  with  BPD  [10,12,14,35,44-46,53].  The  mean 
RSV hospitalization rate of preterm infants was shown to be 
about 10% with a wide range from 0 to 44% (Alaska native 
children). This mean rate was significantly increased to 19% 
(p=0.016) in preterm infants with BPD (range 8.8 to 36.7%). 

Mortality 

 
In children younger than 5 years and particularly in those 
aged  under  1  year  RSV  is  the  most  common  viral  cause  of 
death,  resulting  in  an  estimated  RSV-associated  mortality 
rate of 3.2 per 100.000 person-years for the 1990/91 through 
1998/99  seasons  in  the  United  States  [54].  A  review  of  the 
literature revealed a RSV case fatality rate ranging from 0 to 

12%  including  15  studies  of  developed  countries  and  a  rate 
ranging  from  0  to  9.1%  including  21  developing  countries 
[55].

total  hospital  RSV  mortality  rate  of  1.7%.  All  of  the  RSV 
deaths were reported to have pre-existing medical conditions 
including  chronic  lung  disease  in  12%,  but  a  history  of  
prematurity was not predictive of death. 

 
Sampalis [57] evaluated the impact of RSV infections on 
subsequent  health  care  resource  utilization  in  preterm  in-
fants.  Of  data  from  2415  preterm  infants  (32  to  35  weeks 
gestational age) hospitalized for proven or probable RSV and 
matched  to  20,254  control  infants  the  overall  mortality  rate 
was  8.1%  for  the  RSV  cohort  and  1,6%  for  the  controls 
(p<0.001). The author concluded that RSV hospitalization in 
healthy  premature  infants  was  associated  with  a  significant 
increase  in  subsequent  health  care  resource  utilization  and 
mortality.  

PREVENTION  OF  RSV  INFECTION  WITH  PALIVI-
ZUMAB 

 
In the early 1960s, vaccination of infants with a formalin-
inactivated  RSV vaccine failed  to be  successful despite  sig-
nificant  increases  of  compliment  fixatory  antibodies  in  the 
vaccinated infants [58,59]. The vaccine augmented the sever-
ity of wild virus infection and led to the death of two infants 
in the following season. Standard polyclonal  immunoglobu-
lin  preparations  containing  substantial  levels  of  neutralizing 
antibodies  to  RSV  were  not  successful  in  the  prevention  of 
RSV  hospitalisation.  In  contrast,  the  hyperimmmune  RSV 
globulin (RespiGam®) given intravenously at dosages of 750 
mg/kg monthly over  the  RSV season proved to be save and 
effective in prevention of lower respiratory tract infections in 
high-risk  preterm  infants  and  young  children  [60].  Children 
with  cyanotic  congenital  heart  disease  however  were  more 
likely  to  experience  adverse  events,  such  as  sudden  unex-
plained  death  associated  with  cardiac  surgery,  if  they  re-
ceived  RSV-IGIV.  Thus,  recommendations  for  the  use  of 
RSV-IGIV  published  by  the  American  Academy  of  Pediat-

Resch et al. 

rics  excluded  those  infants  with  CHD  [61].  Despite  its  effi-
cacy,  RSV-IGIV had  the disadvantage of monthly  infusions 
that  were  cumbersome,  expensive,  time-consuming,  and 
stressful  for  both  the  patient  and  the  parents,  and  there  was 
always  the  remote  possibility  of  blood-borne  pathogen 
transmission.  The  development  of  a  highly  potent  RSV-
neutralizing  monoclonal  antibody  (Mab)  was  the  next  ap-
proach  to  improve  the  specific  activity  of  anti-RSV  immu-
noglobulin. In 1997, researchers at MedImmune, Inc. devel-
oped a humanized murine monoclonal antibody called paliv-
izumab  (Synagis®)  that  recognizes  a  conserved  neutralizing 
epitope at the “A” region on the F glycoprotein of RSV [62]. 

 
In a randomized, placebo controlled (palivizumab:placebo 
2:1),  double-blind,  multicenter  phase  III  trial  including  139 
centers  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  the  United  King-
dom  1502  young  children  with  prematurity  ((cid:1)  35  weeks  of 
gestation, (cid:1) 6 months of age) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
((cid:1) 24 months of age, requiring medical treatment within the 
past  6  months  for  their  chronic  lung  disease)  were  included 
during  the  1996  to  1997  RSV  season  to  receive  5  monthly 
(every 30 days) injections of either 15 mg/kg palivizumab or 
an equivalent volume of placebo intramuscularly [45]. Chil-
dren were followed 150 days for the primary endpoint hospi-
talization  due  to  RSV  infection.  Ninety-nine  percent  of  the 
children  in  both  groups  completed  the  study  protocol  and 
93% received all five scheduled injections. Palivizumab pro-
phylaxis  resulted  in  a  55%  reduction  in  hospitalization  as  a 
result  of  RSV  infection.  Details  of  study  results  including 
secondary outcome measures are presented in Table 4 [45]. 

  The  incidence  of  RSV  related  hospitalization  following 
palivizumab  prophylaxis  was  assessed  in  several  retrospec-
tive  and prospective studies  conducted in  Europe and North 
America [63]. In general,  the incidence of RSV related hos-
pital  admissions  after  palivizumab  prophylaxis  in  post-
marketing  surveillance  studies  was  lower  than  the  reported

rates  of  the  IMpact  study  [46].  Data  from  the  American 
Palivizumab  Outcomes  Registry  provide  the  largest  data  
set  available  on  infants  born  prematurely  with  or  without 
BPD and children with CHD (55-58) and are summarized in 
Table 5 [64].  

  Data  from  the  French  Pediatricians'  Group  of  Synagis 
Patients'  Name-Based  Programs  reported  on  7.6%  re-
hospitalisation rate in a population of 515 infants with a high 
rate of 81% of the infants included having BPD [65]. In the 
large  Spanish  trial  of  the  IRIS  Study  Group  [48]  including 
two  study  cohorts  of  a  total  of  3502  infants  over  four  RSV 
seasons (1998 to 2002) an overall reduction of 70% of RSV 
related  hospital  admissions  in  premature  infants  with  and 
without BPD was demonstrated. Infants without prophylaxis 
had a 4-fold increased risk of RSV hospitalization. No deaths 
were reported in palivizumab recipients. 

  Adherence to the monthly injections scheme of palivizu-
mab prophylaxis remains a major problem. Parnes et al., [66] 
noted  lower  re-hospitalisation  rates  in  infants  with  higher 
adherence  to  this  scheme,  and  they  observed  that  approxi-
mately  half  of  RSV  related  hospitalizations  occurred  be-
tween  the  first  and  second  injection.  Similar  findings  were 
also  reported  by  Manzoni  et  al.,  [67],  consistent  with  the 
trends  of  serum  palivizumab  levels  that  may  still  be  inade-
quate  and  not  fully  prototective  after  the  first  monthly  dose 
[68]. Missed or delayed palivizumab injections resulted in an 
increase of RSV related hospitalizations from 2.4 % to 4.4 % 
(p=0.02). In comparison of a home versus office setting dur-
ing  the  2000/2001  season  969  infants  received  palivizumab 
injections  at  home  by  a  nurse  and  477  in  the  office  of  a  
pediatrician [69]. Comparing home  versus office, compliance 
was  98%  compared  with  89%  (p<0.001),  and  RSV  
related  hospitalization  rate  was  0.93%  compared  with  
3.57%  (p<0.001).  During  a  multicenter  observational  study 
of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalizations and 
use  of  palivizumab  in  premature  infants  aged  29-32  weeks 
over two RSV seasons (2001 to 2003) in Austria 238 infants 
received  palivizumab  prophylaxis  [11].  The  rate  of  inade-
quate or incomplete injections was very high (62%) resulting 
in an increased rehospitalisation rate of 8.1% compared with 
3.3% of adequate prophylaxis (12/148 vs. 3/90, p=0.07). 

CONCLUSION 

  A  vaccine  for  RSV  is  needed,  and  a  protective  live  at-
tenuated  vaccine  administered  at  or  around  birth  would  be 
ideal. However, problems like insufficient attenuation of the 
vaccine  strain  of  RSV,  its  thermolability,  and  the  need  to 

include A and B strains in each vaccine have hindered trials 
in infants under 3 months of age [4]. Prevention of RSV re-
lated  hospitalizations  in  preterm  infants  by  monthly  injec-
tions  of  monoclonal  antibodies  like  palivizumab  or  in  the 
near  future  motavizumab  is  recommended  in  selected  high-
risk  groups  [70]  but  still  discussed  due  to  the  high  costs  of 
the product. Recent studies focused on RSV risk factor mod-
els  aiming  to  tailor  prophylactic  treatment  with  monoclonal 
antibodies  to  those  preterm  infants  with  the  highest  risk  for 
severe RSV related disease [71-74]. Until a vaccine is devel-
oped efforts to offer prophylaxis to high-risk infants is man-
datory.
