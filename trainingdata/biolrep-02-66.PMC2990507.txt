Abstract
Echinocandins are the most recent introduction to the antifungal armamentarium and target the
synthesis of b-(1,3)-glucan, the major structural polysaccharide of the fungal cell wall. Mechanisms
have been identified that reduce the efficacy of the echinocandins: mutations of the Fks subunit of the
target enzyme complex or a compensatory increase in the production of chitin, the second structural
cell wall polysaccharide.

Introduction and context
Caspofungin was the first echinocandin approved for
clinical use, followed by anidulafungin and micafungin
[1]. Echinocandins are cyclic lipopeptides that target the
fungal cell wall by inhibiting b-(1,3)-glucan synthesis
[2]. b-(1,3)-glucan is synthesized by a protein complex
composed of an integral membrane protein catalytic
subunit, Fks, and a regulatory subunit,
the Rho1
GTPase, which also regulates protein kinase C (PKC)
[3,4]. Most fungi have a number of alternative Fks
subunits. Echinocandins are effective against a range of
fungal human pathogens and are fungicidal against a
number of Candida species, including Candida albicans.
In the case of
the filamentous mould Aspergillus
fumigatus, echinocandins are fungicidal against actively
growing hyphal tips but are less effective against non-
growing subapical cells [5].

Major recent advances
Although echinocandins are highly efficacious in the
treatment of invasive fungal infections and now are used
as first-line therapies in many hospitals, several examples
of clinical failures due to breakthrough infections have
been reported over the last few years [6]. Lab-based
studies with C. albicans identified dominant mutations in
the target protein Fks1, the catalytic subunit of b-(1,3)-
glucan synthase which conferred acquired echinocandin
resistance [7]. The C. albicans Fks1 mutations mapped

onto two hotspot regions at amino acids 641-649 and
1345-1365. The same hotspot mutations were identified
in clinical isolates from patients who failed or responded
poorly to echinocandin therapy, and the in vivo
echinocandin resistance of these isolates was validated
in a systemic candidiasis murine model [7]. Acquired
mutations in FKS1 and FKS2 genes have now been
identified in a wide range of Candida species and
fumigatus [8-10]. Sequencing the FKS genes from
A.
fungi cultured from echinocandin-treated patients with
clinical
failure due to breakthrough infections has
identified mutations in some but not all of the isolates
[6,11]. In general, the prevalence of Fks mutations in
geographically diverse clinical isolates of several Candida
species remains low [12]. b-(1,3)-glucan synthase kinetic
assays have shown that the sensitivity of the mutated
glucan synthase to caspofungin is reduced, resulting in
an increased inhibition constant (Ki) [13,14].

Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii have a
reduced susceptibility to echinocandins, and this
susceptibility is thought to result from naturally occurring
polymorphisms in the Fks1p hotspot region which match
the acquired mutations identified in echinocandin-
resistant isolates of other species [15-17]. Hotspot muta-
tions are more likely to confer resistance to caspofungin
than to anidulafungin and micafungin and in many cases
result in higher minimum inhibitory concentrations

(MICs) for caspofungin than for the other two [12,14].
However, differences in the potency of the three echino-
candin drugs observed in vitro diminish in the presence
of 50% serum and therefore cross-resistance would occur
in vivo [18].

Another mechanism that results in reduced echinocan-
din susceptibility in vitro is the activation of cell wall
salvage or compensatory pathways (the PKC cell integrity
pathway in particular) [19,20], which result in elevated
chitin levels. Treatment of C. albicans in vitro with sub-
MIC caspofungin activates chitin synthesis, and recipro-
cally cells that have higher cell wall chitin are less
susceptible to caspofungin [19,21]. Elevated chitin
appears to be an adaptive response to growth in the
presence of echinocandins in an attempt to maintain cell
wall integrity, and subsequent growth in the absence of
drug restores chitin to wild-type levels. Therefore, this is
an example of a drug tolerance mechanism rather than
resistance. In addition to the importance of the PKC
pathway in the response to echinocandins, the Ca2+/
calcineurin signaling pathway plays a role as genetic or
pharmaceutical blockade of
that pathway renders
C. albicans and A. fumigatus hypersensitive to echinocan-
dins [19,21]. The chaperone protein Hsp90, acting
through its client protein calcineurin, has also been
implicated in the regulation of echinocandin resistance
[22]. As Ca2+/calcineurin in turn regulates chitin synth-
esis [23] and cell wall biogenesis, there are intriguing
connections between Hsp90, cell wall and membrane
stress, and drug resistance and tolerance.

Future directions
To date, fungal echinocandin resistance does not seem to
be a major cause for concern in the treatment of patients
with invasive mycoses [24]. However, there is increasing
evidence of natural and acquired resistance resulting in
recalcitrant life-threatening infections and clinical failure.
The reduced susceptibility of fungal cells with elevated
chitin requires further investigation to determine
whether this phenomenon, observed in vitro, also occurs
when infected patients are exposed to sub-MIC echino-
candin doses. Within a population, there is a subset of
cells with higher-than-average chitin levels [19] and it has
yet to be determined whether these can persist in the
presence of echinocandin treatment and out grow,
resulting in a drug-tolerant population. Fungal azole
antifungal resistance is dependent on a number of
different mechanisms that include upregulation of drug
efflux pumps as well as mutation of the drug target
[25]. Chromosomal rearrangements and specifically
the generation of an isochromosome of the left arm
of chromosome 5 also result in azole resistance in
C. albicans [26,27]. Genome-wide population studies

have been used to map the evolution of azole resistance
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [28] and C. albicans [29].
Similar population studies to look at the evolution of
echinocandin resistance would be informative to assess
the relative contributions of acquisition of Fks point
mutations and activation of chitin biosynthesis as
resistance and tolerance mechanisms and to identify
alternative factors and pathways that play a role in
decreased echinocandin susceptibility.
