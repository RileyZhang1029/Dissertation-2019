Abstract
Global climate change threatens the health of hundreds of millions of people. While much has been
written about the direct impacts of climate change on health as a result of more severe storms, more
intense heat stress, changes in the distribution of infectious disease, and reduced air quality, we are
concerned that the indirect impacts of a disrupted climate system may be orders of magnitude more
important in terms of the human suffering they cause. Because these indirect effects will result from
changes in biophysical systems, which are inherently complex, there is significant uncertainty about
their magnitude, timing, and location. However, the uncertainty that shrouds this issue should not be
cause for complacency; rather it should serve as an organizing principle for adaptation to its ill effects.

Human activity is disrupting Earth’s climate, and the rising
emissions of greenhouse gases are accelerating that
disruption. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
exceed anything Earth has experienced in the past million
years and are rapidly approaching levels not seen since
the Eocene when there were no ice caps, sea level was
100 m above current levels, and there were crocodiles near
the North Pole. Global temperatures have been rising
steadily for nearly 40 years; the eight warmest years on
record have occurred since 2001 and the global average
land-surface temperature for the period January to
September 2010 was the second warmest on record
behind 2007. In addition to rising mean global surface
temperatures, climatic disruption is causing other changes
to the physical conditions of the planet. Among these are
rising sea level and changes in the pattern of precipitation
leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and forest fires,
and more extreme storms. Some of the health conse-
quences of climate change are straightforward: warmer
temperatures, changes in the hydrologic cycle, increased
ground-level ozone, and enhanced pollen production will
increase exposure to heat stress, alter patterns of infectious
disease, and compromise air quality. These and similar

direct impacts of climate change have been well covered in
the scientific literature.

However, we believe that there is another threat, one that
is orders of magnitude more potent than those which
have been emphasized to date. Here we argue that it is
the indirect
impacts of climate change—large-scale
alterations to Earth’s natural systems—that pose the
greatest risk to human health. These changes are
curtailing access to water and food and are undermining
the very concept of stable homes, yet have received scant
attention in the literature,
including the report of
Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) [1]. Enormous uncertainties
surround predictions regarding how climate change may
affect human well-being. Acknowledging these uncer-
tainties is a critical component of designing optimal
approaches to mediating the health impacts of climate
change.

Water
Water scarcity is already a major global issue that carries
heavy adverse health sequelae, and climate change will

further destabilize access to fresh water. A sampling of
four current crises illustrates the gravity of the situation.
One: In the North China Plain, where half of China’s
wheat is grown, the water table is falling by as much as
3 m per year. Two: Certain states in India are using half
of their electricity budget to pump water from depths
as deep as 1 km to irrigate crops. Three: Roughly
300 million Chinese and Indians are eating food grown
on “fossil” water that is not replenished. Four: In the
Middle East and North Africa, current rates of freshwater
use are equivalent to 115% of total renewable runoff.
Given such unsustainable use around the world, the
number of people living in water-scarce countries is
expected to rise sixfold from 470 million to 3 billion
between 1990 and 2025.

Future trends are of even greater concern. Rapid human
population growth combined with economic develop-
ment begets increased water demand from homes,
industry, and agriculture. In agriculture alone, the amount
of water required to keep pace with global food demand
—
roughly 2000–3000 km3—represents a tripling of water
used for irrigation. This is water that, in many parts of
the world, simply is not available.

The availability of adequate potable water is a pillar of
public health without which human well-being falters.
In addition to hindering food production, inadequate
access to water and sanitation has direct effects on
human health. Today, half of the urban populations of
Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean suffer
from diseases associated with inadequate access to water
and sanitation, and roughly 1.7 million people die every
year from these diseases.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate water scarcity in
several ways. Scientists predict that the hydrologic cycle
will be altered with, generally speaking, wet areas
becoming wetter while dry areas become dryer. Pre-
cipitation will likely fall in greater amounts and cause
more rapid runoff. Heavy precipitation events and
associated runoff may make water supplies less reliable
and may also make conditions favorable to outbreaks of
water-borne disease. In the United States, for example,
over 50% of water-borne disease outbreaks in the second
half of the 20th century were preceded by precipitation
events that were above the 90th percentile [2].

Warmer temperatures will also increase evapotranspira-
tion, increasing water requirements for agriculture. At the
same time, the availability of water during the height of
the growing season may be less, owing to earlier melting
of winter snowpack in the spring, leaving less water for
summer irrigation. Agricultural systems dependent on

glacial melt, such as the Andean nations of South
America or much of Asia that receives water from the
Tibetan plateau, may suffer such a fate as glaciers melt
away. As these glaciers dwindle, they will provide ever less
dry-season water flow into many of the world’s great
rivers. The Indus River, for example, receives 40 50% of
its dry-season flow from glaciers that are rapidly
receding. Finally, sea-level rise and more extreme storms
will lead to coastal inundation and intrusion of salt
water into freshwater aquifers, further reducing coastal
freshwater supply.

Nutrition
Perhaps even more problematic to human welfare in the
coming century than a further diminution in the
availability of fresh water is the impact of climatic
disruption on the supply of food. As with water, global
access to food is already tenuous. In 2009, the number of
people suffering from protein-calorie malnutrition
exceeded 1 billion after reaching a low of around 830
million in the 1990s (Figure 1). In poor countries around
the world, malnutrition underlies roughly one-third of
the entire burden of disease, and roughly 2 to 3 billion
people—almost half the human population—already
suffer from micronutrient deficiencies.

Looking forward, farmers around the world will need to
double agricultural production by 2050 in order to keep
up with demand from a growing and more affluent
human population that aspires to a more meat-based
diet. This doubling of output will need to occur despite
headwinds that already strain agricultural productivity.
Water scarcity, as discussed above, is a major constraint
to increasing agricultural production.
In addition,

roughly one-third of the Earth’s land surface suffers from
land degradation from the combined effects of soil
erosion, salinization, nutrient depletion, and desertifica-
tion. Finally, the rise of the biofuels industry—evidenced
in the diversion of one-quarter of the US grain harvest
to biofuel production—is generating enormous demand
for grain. By increasing grain demand and, as a con-
sequence, demand for arable land and irrigation,
growing grains as biofuel feedstock pits human food
needs against biofuel production.

Amid rapidly rising demand for food, increasing envir-
onmental pressures on food production, and growing
human malnutrition, climate change additionally com-
promises both agricultural yields and the nutritional
quality of the crops produced. Agricultural productivity is
well known to be sensitive to changes in growing season
temperatures. Observational, longitudinal, and model-
ing studies all confirm that a 1°C rise in temperature
corresponds to roughly a 10% reduction in yield of
the major grains [3-5]. As temperatures rise 2–6°C over
the next century, the reduction in agricultural yield will
depend, in part, on our capacity to adapt and, in part, on
how temperature variability changes; but, in general,
yields are expected to drop.

Climate change has further relevance to agricultural
yields. As discussed above, climate change is expected to
alter the timing and quantity of water available for
agriculture while increasing the needs of plants as
temperatures rise. Increased production of ground-level
ozone curtails agricultural yields, as ozone is a potent
plant toxin. When ozone concentrations reach 30–45 ppb
(parts per billion), yield losses for the major grains
approach 10–40%. By 2030, mean annual ozone con-
centrations in South Asia are expected to exceed 50 ppb.
Increasingly intense tropical cyclones, sea level rise, more
frequent
fires, droughts, and floods will also
conspire to diminish local harvests.

forest

Despite strong evidence that climate change will
increase the risk of numerous challenges to agricultural
production, the net effect of climate change on global
food production is difficult
to quantify. Little is
known, for example, about how climate change may
alter the relationships between plants and their pests
and pathogens,
though several worrying examples
indicate that climate change may promote infestations
of plant pests, as higher winter minimum temperatures
enable insects to overwinter more effectively. Also
poorly understood is how climate change will impact
the extent and pattern of cloud cover which, to some
degree, determines the solar radiation available to
plants for photosynthesis.

In addition to these impacts on the quantity of food
produced, it appears that rising concentrations of atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide also affect nutritional quality.
Grains grown at elevated concentrations of carbon
dioxide appear to have reduced concentrations of
protein,
iron, zinc, and perhaps other nutrients. As
with other examples already cited in this article, these
potential decrements in plant nutritional content are of
particular concern given the current state of affairs: iron
and zinc deficiency account for roughly 63 million years
of life lost annually, and the major grains are a critical
source of these nutrients for many populations around
the world [6,7]. Taken together, these additional threats
to food production may very well have extensive impacts
on human nutrition and global health.

Displacement
Population displacement may be the final common
pathway for many of
the climate change impacts
discussed above. Regional changes in precipitation
leading to increased droughts and flooding, increased
incidence of natural disasters like tropical cyclones and
forest fires, local crop failures, and severe water scarcity
are all
likely to force people around the world to
abandon their homes (Figure 2). In addition to these
threats, coastal vulnerability puts many people at risk for
displacement. More than one-third of
the human
population lives in coastal areas and on small islands
that are within 100 km of the shore and less than 50 m
above sea level. The combination of sea-level rise,
increasingly intense storms, and destruction of coastal
barriers (mangroves, wetlands, vegetated dunes, and
coral reefs) leaves these populations extremely vulner-
able. By 2050 an estimated 200 million to 1 billion

people may be displaced due to climate change. These
estimates are highly uncertain in part because many of
the biophysical changes that contribute to displacement
remain hard to quantify [8,9].

Despite this uncertainty, a significant fraction of the
human population will undoubtedly be displaced in this
century, and displaced persons face stark health realities.
Nonimmune populations migrating into endemic areas
are more susceptible to a variety of infectious diseases.
Poor housing, sanitation, and access to safe drinking water
combined with poor nutrition lead to disease epidemics,
particularly diarrheal disease, measles, and acute respira-
tory infections. Malnutrition plagues displaced popula-
tions, with rates as high as 50% seen in refugee populations
in Africa [10]. In addition to infectious disease and
malnutrition, displaced people suffer from high rates of
violence, sexual abuse, and mental illness. Post-traumatic
stress disorder has been diagnosed in 30–75% of resettled
refugee children and adolescents [11]. Finally, displace-
ment may lead to civil strife and violent conflict as large
numbers of people with few resources move into areas
where they frequently are not welcome.

Living with uncertainty
There is no doubt that climate change will have important
impacts on human health, but we are uncertain about

what those impacts will be and where and when they will
be most severe. The most consequential health effects of
climate change will come about from interactions between
biophysical changes to the natural environment, demo-
graphic trends, and human adaptations (Figure 3). The
biophysical changes—such as temperature variability or
sea level rise—are difficult to predict with accuracy today,
and the capacity for adapting to these changes is largely
unknown.

But uncertainty about the exact timing,
location, or
magnitude of climate change impacts is no excuse for
complacency. With evidence that climate change is
already imposing a hefty health burden, the future
climate, particularly if greenhouse gas releases into the
atmosphere go unabated, portends health crises for
hundreds of millions of people. Rather than be used as a
rationale for inaction, the uncertainty inherent in climate
science should serve as an organizing principle for
adaptation to its ill effects. For example, uncertainty
about future viable regions and conditions for agricul-
ture requires a variety of new crop strains with traits such
as heat and drought resistance. Changes in the timing of
seasonal flow from melting snowpack or glaciers call for
a dramatic increase in water-storage capacity for people
depending on these flows for household use or irriga-
tion. Insurance schemes allowing different countries or

populations to pool their risk of crop failure and food
insecurity might be enacted to blunt the toll of regional
climatic disruption. Surveillance efforts should be
designed that allow us to better detect changing
distributions of infectious disease, water scarcity, or
food insecurity early on so that resources can be
efficiently redirected.

Never before have the consumption patterns of those in
the wealthy countries of the world played such an
important role in putting the health of the poor at greater
risk. How the wealthy world responds to the moral
imperative to help the developing world adapt
to
climate-change vulnerability will be a defining character-
istic of this century.
