Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive free radical and a messenger molecule in many physiological functions. However, excessive NO is believed to 
be a mediator of neurotoxicity. The medicinal plant Coriolus versicolor is known to possess anti-tumor and immune-potentiating 
activities. In this study, we investigated whether Coriolus versicolor possesses a protective effect against NO donor sodium nitro-
prusside (SNP)-induced apoptosis in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC. We utilized 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
di phenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, terminal deoxy nu-
cleo tidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, DNA fragmentation assay, reverse transcription-
poly merase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis, and caspase-3 enzyme activity assay in SK-N-MC cells. MTT assay 
show ed that SNP treatment significantly reduces the viability of cells, and the viabilities of cells pre-treated with the aqueous extract 
of Co riolus versicolor cultivated in citrus extract (CVEcitrus) was increased. However, aqueous extract of Coriolus versicolor cul ti-
vated in synthetic medium (CVEsynthetic) showed no protective effect and aqueous citrus extract (CE) had a little protective effect. The 
cell treated with SNP exhibited several apoptotic features, while those pre-treated for 1 h with CVEcitrus prior to SNP expose showed 
reduced apoptotic features. The cells pre-treated for 1 h with CVEcitrus prior to SNP expose inhibited p53 and Bax expressions and 
caspase-3 enzyme activity up-regulated by SNP. We showed that CVEcitrus exerts a protective effect against SNP-induced apoptosis in 
SK-N-MC cells. Our study suggests that CVEcitrus has therapeutic value in the treatment of a variety of NO-induced brain diseases.

INTRODUCTION

Coriolus versicolor, known as Yun-zhi in Korean, is a mush room 
and belongs to the class Basidiomycetes. Medicinal mushrooms have 
been used to treat various diseases. Of theses, Coriolus versicolor 
has been demonstrated to possess a wide range of biological acti-
vi ties, which include anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and

immune-potentiating activities (Ng, 1998; Borchers et al., 1999). 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive free radical gas and a messenger 
molecule with many physiological functions (Schmidt and Walter, 
1994; Yun et al., 1996). NO is generated from L-arginine by nitric 
oxide synthase (NOS), and it is synthesized in neurons, astrocytes, 
microglial cells, endothelial cells, and many other cell types 
(Garthwaite and Boulton, 1995). Moreover, in the mammalian 
central nervous system, NO modulates many physiological 
functions including neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and 
memory (Hawkins, 1996; Hölscher, 1997). However, excessive NO 
formation is now believed to be a mediator of neurotoxicity, and 
NO is known to induce apoptosis in a variety of disorders, such as 
Alzheimer disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
dementia, and multiple sclerosis (Gross and Wolin, 1995; Dawson 
and Dawson, 1996).
Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is a biological 
process that plays a crucial role in normal development and 
tissue homeostasis (Woodle and Kulkarni, 1998). However, 
this type of cell death also contributes to a variety of human 
disorders (Thompson, 1995). The characteristic morphological 
changes associated with apoptosis are cell shrinkage, chromatin 
condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and the 
formation of apoptotic bodies (Wyllie et al., 1980; Chandra et 
al., 2000; Jang et al., 2002). Several gene expressions have been 
demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. P53 is 
a short-lived transcriptional activator that induces apoptosis (Lowe 
and Ruley, 1993) and the activation of p53 regulates the expression 
of Bax (Xiang et al., 1998) which is a proapoptotic member of the 
Bcl-2 family of intracellular proteins. Bcl-2 family proteins also 
play important roles in regulation of apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family 
proteins are classified into anti-apoptotic proteins, including 
Bcl-2 and Bcl-2XL, and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and 
Bid. The balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-
2 family members determines the mitochondrial response to 
apoptotic stimuli (Kim et al., 2010; Upadhyay et al., 2003). Bax 
alters the permeability of mitochondrial membranes and triggers 
caspases cascade activation (Budihardjo et al., 1999; Korsmeyer, 
1999; Upadhyay et al., 2003). The caspases are a class of cysteine 
proteases, and are considered to be central players of the apoptotic 
process and to trigger a cascade of proteolytic cleavages of many 
proteins in mammals (Aggarwal, 2000). In particular, the most 
widely studied member of the caspase family, caspase-3, is a key 
executioner of apoptosis, and is partially or totally responsible for 
the proteolytic cleavage of many proteins (Cohen, 1997; Ko et al., 
2009). 
Citrus fruits contain sugar, organic acids, and a number of 
physiologically active components, such as citric acid, ascorbic 

acid, minerals, coumarins, and flavonoids (Tanizawa et al., 1992; 
Kawaii et al., 1999). Moreover, the aqueous extract of Coriolus 
versicolor cultivated in citrus extract has been reported to have 
anti-cancer and anti-oxidant effects (Lee et al., 2003). In this study, 
we tried to find out the cultivation method to improve the efficacy 
of Coriolus versicolor on neuronal apoptosis, that is the basic 
underlying mechanism of many neurodegenerative disorders.
In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of the 
aqueous extracts of Coriolus versicolor cultivated in synthetic me di-
um (CVEsynthetic), aqueous extract of citrus (CE), and the aqueous 
extract of Coriolus versicolor cultivated in citrus extract (CVEcitrus) 
against NO-induced apoptosis in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-
N-MC. For this study, apoptosis in SK-N-MC cells was indu ced 
using sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, and the pro tec ti ve 
effect of Coriolus versicolor was investigated by using 3-(4,5-di-
me thylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium  bromide  (MTT)  assay, 
flow cytometry, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, 
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick 
end labeling (TUNEL) assay, DNA fragmentation assay, reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot 
analysis, and caspase-3 enzyme assay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Preparation of Coriolus versicolor extract
Coriolus versicolor was cultivated in synthetic medium for 6 
days at 30oC with constant shaking at 150 rpm. After filtering 
through a #4 Whatman filter paper, the medium was concentrated 
using a rotary evaporator, and then lyophilized to yield 5 g/L of a 
powder was obtained (CVEsynthetic). Coriolus versicolor was also 
cultivated in citrus extract media using identical conditions, to 
yield 7 g/L powder (CVEcitrus). Citrus extract was obtained from 
the Jeju Provincial Development Corporation (Jeju, Korea) and 
was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and lyophilized, to 
yield 88 g/L powder (CE).

Cell culture 
The human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells were cultured in Dul-
becco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, 
NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
se rum (FBS; Gibco BRL) at 37oC in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 humidified 
cell incubator, and the medium was changed every 2 days. 

MTT cytotoxicity assay
The cell viability was determined using the MTT assay kit accor-
ding to the manufacturer’s instructions (Boehringer Mannheim 
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)(Lee et al., 2005). The cells were

trea ted with SNP at concentrations of 0.01 mM, 0.05 mM, 0.1 mM, 
0.5 mM, and 1.0 mM for 24 h. To investigate the protective effect 
of Coriolus versicolor against cell death induced by SNP, the cells 
were pre-treated for 1 h with CVEsynthetic, CE, and CVEcitrus each at 
0.01 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1.0 mg/ml, and 
then treated with SNP for 24 h. Ten μl of MTT labeling reagent was 
added to each well, and plates were incubated for 4 h. Subsequently, 
100 μl of solubilization solution was added to each well, and plates 
were incubated for another 12 h. Absorbance was measured at test 
wavelength of 595 nm using a reference wavelength of 690 nm 
with a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The 
optical density (O.D.) was calculated as the difference between the 
absorbance at the reference wavelength and that at the test wave-
length. The percent viability was calculated as follows: The percent 
viability was calculated by (O.D. of drug-treated sample/control 
O.D.)×100. 

Morphological changes
After treatment with SNP, the cells were washed three times in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 100% methanol 
at -20oC for 10 min. The cells were then observed under a phase- 
contrast microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as a previously 
described method (Jang et al., 2002).

TUNEL assay
To detect apoptotic cells in situ, TUNEL assay was performed 
using ApoTagⓇ peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit 
(Boehringer Mannheim GmbH) (Lee et al., 2005). The cells (2×104 
cells/ chamber) were cultured on 4-chamber slides (Nalge Nunc 
International, Naperville, IL, USA), washed with PBS, and fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at 4oC. The fixed cells 
were incubated with digoxigenin-conjugated dUTP in a terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-catalyzed reaction for 1 h at 37oC 
in a humidified atmosphere, then with a stop/wash buffer for 
10 min at room temperature, and finally with anti-digoxigenin 
antibody conjugated with peroxidase for another 30 min. The 
DNA fragments were stained using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Sigma 
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), a peroxidase substrate.

DAPI staining
To determine whether SNP induces apoptosis, DAPI staining 
was performed as a previously described method (Lee et al., 
2005). Briefly, the cells were cultured on 4-chamber slides, washed 
twice with PBS, fixed by incubating with 4% PFA for 30 min, 
washed with PBS, incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min in 
the dark, and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, 
Oberköchen, Germany). 

DNA fragmentation
DNA fragmentation assay was performed using ApopLadder EXTM 
DNA fragmentation assay kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) (Lee et al., 2005). 
The cells were pre-treated for 1 h with CVEcitrus and treated with 
SNP, lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer, incubated with 10 μl of 10% 
so di um dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution containing 10 μl of Enzyme 
A at 56oC for 1 h, and then incubated with 10 μl of Enzyme B at 
37oC for another 1 h. This mixture was added with 70 μl of preci-
pi tant and 500 μl of ethanol and centrifuged for 15 min. DNA was 
extracted by washing the pellet in ethanol and resuspending it in 
Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. DNA fragmentation was visualized by 2% 
agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide.

Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed as a previously described 
method (Jang et al., 2002). Briefly, after pre-treatment for 1 h with 
CVEcitrus and the treating them with SNP, the cells were collected, 
fixed by incubating with 75% ethanol in PBS at −20oC for 1 h, then 
incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide 
in PBS for 30 min at 37oC, and analyzed using FACScan (Becton 
Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the SK-N-MC cells using easy-
BLUETM total RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (iNtRON, INC., Seoul, Korea) (Lee et al., 2005). Two 
μg of RNA and 2 μl of random hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI, 
USA) were added together and the mixture was heated at 65oC for 
10 min. To the mixture, 1 μl of AMV reverse transcriptase (Pro me ga), 5 
μl of 10 mM dNTP (Promega), 1 μl of RNasin (Promega), and 5 μl 
of 10×AMV RT buffer (Promega) were added and the final volume 
was adjusted to 50 μl with dimethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated 
water. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 42oC for 1 h. 
PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 40 μl 
con tain ing 1 μl of the appropriate cDNA, 1 μl of each set of primers 
at a concentration of 10 pM, 4 μl of 10×reaction buffer, 1 μl of 
2.5 mM dNTP, and 2 units Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The 
primer sequences for p53 were 5’-CAG CCA AGT CTG TGA 
CTT GCA CGT AC-3’ (a 26-mer sense oligonucleotide) and 5’-
CTA TGT CGA AAA GTG TTT CTG TCA TC-3’ (a 26-mer 
anti-sense oligonucleotide). The primer sequences for Bax were 
5’-GTG CAC CAA GGT GCC GGA AC-3’ (a 20-mer sense oligo-
nucleotide) and 5’-TCA GCC CAT CTT CTT CCA GA-3’ (a 20-
mer anti-sense oligonucleotide). The primer sequences for the in ter-
nal control cyclophilin were 5’-ACC CCA CCG TGT TCT TCG 
AC-3’ (a 20-mer sense oligonucleotide starting at position 52) and 
5’-CAT TTG CCA TGG ACA AGA TG-3’ (a 20-mer anti-sense

oligonucleotide starting at position 332). The expected sizes of the 
PCR products were 293 bp for p53, 205 bp for Bax, and 291 bp for 
cyclophilin. 
For Bax, the PCR procedure was carried out using a GeneAmp 
9600 PCR system (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) under the 
fol lowing conditions: initial denaturation at 94oC for 5 min, fol-
lo wed by 30 amplification cycles, each consisting of denaturation 
at 94oC for 30 sec, annealing at 58oC for 30 sec, and extension at 
72oC for 30 sec, with an additional extension step at the end of the 
procedure at 72oC for 5 min. The PCR procedure was carried out un-
der identical conditions except that 35 amplification cycles for p53 
and 25 amplification cycles for cyclophilin were per formed. The 
final amount of RT-PCR product was calculated densitometrically 
using Molecular AnalystTM version 1.4.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, 
USA).

Western blot analysis
Western blot was performed as a previously described method 
(Kim et al., 2010). The cells were lysed in the lysis buffer containing 
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 
1% nonidet-P40 (NP40), 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl 
fluoride (PMSF), and 100 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein concentration 
was measured using a Bio-Rad colorimetric protein assay kit (Bio-
Rad). Protein of 50 μg was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide 
gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher 
& Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Mouse anti-p53 antibody 
(1 : 500; Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit anti-
phospho p53 (Thr 18) antibody (1 : 200; Santa Cruz Biotech), and 
mouse anti-Bax antibody (1 : 1,000; Santa Cruz Biotech) were 
used as primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 
anti-mouse antibody for p53 and Bax, and anti-rabbit antibody 
for phospho p53 (1 : 1,000; Santa Cruz Biotech) were used as 
secondary antibody. The detection of the band was performed 
using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system 
(Amersham Pharmacia Biothech GmbH, Freiburg, Germany).

Caspase-3 enzyme activity assay
Caspase-3 enzyme activity was measured using the ApoAlertⓇ 
caspase-3 assay kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocols (Kim et al., 2003). In brief, the cells 
were lysed with 50 μl of chilled Cell Lysis Buffer. A 50 μl aliquot of 
2×reaction buffer (containing DTT) and 5 μl of the appropriate 
conjugated substrate at a concentration of 1 mM were added to 
each lysate. The mixture was incubated in a water bath at 37oC 
for 1 h, and the absorbance was measured using a microtiter plate 
reader at a test wavelength of 405 nm.

Statistical analyses
The results are expressed as the mean±standard error of the mean

Duncan’s post-hoc test using SPSS. The difference was considered 
statistically significant at p<0.05.

RESULTS

Effect of Coriolus versicolor against SNP-induced cytotoxi-
city
The  viability  of  cells  incubated  with  SNP  for  24  h  at 
concentrations of 0.01 mM, 0.05 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, or 1.0 
mM was 95.50±0.64%, 88.09± 0.60%, 78.20±0.77%, 52.72±1.13%, 
or 34.14±0.69%, respectively (Fig. 1A). As the SNP concentration 
was increased, the cell viability was decreased. The viability of cells 
exposed to the 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h was 52.72±1.13%.
The viability of the cells pre-treated for 1 h with the CVEsynthetic at 
concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, or 1.0 mg/
ml, and then exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h was 52.69±0.81%, 
53.47±0.54%, 55.67±1.02%, or 53.42±1.08%, respectively (Fig. 1B). 
The viability of the cells pre-treated for 1 h with the CE at 
concentrations 0.05 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, or 1.0 mg/
ml, and then exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h was 58.39±0.64%, 
60.07±1.26%, 66.48±0.77%, or 66.14±2.01, respectively (Fig. 1C). 
The viability of the cells pre-treated for 1 h with the CVEcitrus at 
concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, or 1.0 mg/
ml, and then exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h was increased 
to 56.22±1.39%, 64.03±3.01%, 77.24±0.70%, or 83.37±1.36%, 
respectively (Fig. 1D). 
The above data demonstrated that the cell viability was reduced 
by SNP and that CVEsynthetic showed no significant protective effect 
against NO-induced cytotoxicity in SK-N-MC cells and that CE 
had a little protective effect against NO-induced cytotoxicity. The 
most potent protective effect against the SNP-induced cytotoxicity 
was observed for CVEcitrus. Therefore, we selected CVEcitrus for 
further study (Fig. 1). 

Morphological changes
To characterize SNP-induced changes in cell morphology, the 
cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy. The cells 
treated with 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h detached from the culture dish, 
and became rounded and irregular in shape with cytoplasmic 
blebbings. The cells pre-treated for 1 h with the 1.0 mg/ml CVEcitrus 
and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h were indistinguishable from 
the normal cells (Fig. 2, Upper).
In the DAPI assay, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, 
and perinuclear apoptotic bodies were detected in the cells treated

with the 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h. The cells pre-treated for 1 h with 
the 1.0 mg/ml CVEcitrus and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h were 
comparable to the normal cells (Fig. 2, Middle). 
To further confirm the induction of apoptosis by SNP in the 
SK-N-MC cells, the 0.5 mM SNP-treated cells were analyzed via 
TUNEL assay. TUNEL-positive cells were found to be stained 
dark brown under the light microscope and nuclear condensation 
was observed, whereas the cells pre-treated for 1 h with the 1.0 mg/
ml CVEcitrus and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h had near normal 
morphology (Fig. 2, Lower). 

Characterization of apoptosis by DNA fragmentation
In order to ascertain the protective effect of CVEcitrus against 
SNP-induced apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, reflecting the 
endonuclease activity characteristic of apoptosis, was analyzed. 
SNP treatment at 0.5 mM for 24 h resulted in the formation of 
definite fragments which could be seen via electrophoresis as

pre-treated with CVEcitrus at 0.5 mg/ml or 1.0 mg/ml for 1 h and

a characteristic ladder pattern. Pre-treatment for 1 h with 1.0 
mg/ml CVEcitrus and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h resulted 
in a significant reduction in the intensity of SNP-induced DNA 
laddering (Fig. 3). 

Cell cycle distribution changes
Through flow cytometric analysis of DNA content using the 
DNA-specific dye PI, we assessed the protective effect of CVEcitrus 
against SNP-induced cell death. The population of cells in the 
sub-G1 phase in the 0.5 mM SNP-treated group increased from 
12.90% (control level) to 24.77%, whereas this figure was reduced 
by CVEcitrus pre-treatment at 0.5 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml for 1 h and 
exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h to 18.50% or 16.38%, respectively 
(Fig. 4). 

Expressions of p53 and Bax mRNA
The RT-PCR was performed to estimate the relative expressions 
of the p53 and Bax mRNA. In the present study, the mRNA level 
of p53 in the control was set at 1.00. The level of p53 mRNA 
following treatment with 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h increased to 
13.79±4.21, but it was only 3.30±0.57 or 2.28±0.27 in the cells 
pre-treated with CVEcitrus at 0.5 mg/ml or 1.0 mg/ml for 1 h and 
exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h, respectively.
The mRNA level of Bax in the control was set at 1.00. The level 
of Bax mRNA following treatment with 0.5 mM SNP increased

Western blot analysis of p53 and Bax
When the cells were treated with 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h, Bax (21 
kDa) and p53 protein (53 kDa) expressions were up-regulated. 
Compared to these cells, those of cells pre-treated with CVEcitrus at 
0.5 mg/ml or 1.0 mg/ml for 1 h and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 
h showed lower Bax and p53 protein expressions. 
When the expressions of p53, phosphor-p53, and Bax in the 
control cells were set at 1.00, p53 expression after treatment with 
0.5 mM SNP for 24 h increased to 13.20±1.29, but it was only 
5.43±1.28 or 1.72±0.25 in the cells pre-treated with CVEcitrus at 0.5 
mg/ml or 1.0 mg/ml for 1 h and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h, 
respectively. The phpspho-p53 (Thr 18) expression after treatment 
with 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h increased to 11.60±1.28, but it was only 
5.99±0.86 or 3.92±0.83 in the cells pre-treated with CVEcitrus at 0.5 
mg/ml or 1.0 mg/ml for 1 h and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 
h, respectively. The Bax expression after treatment with 0.5 mM 
SNP for 24 h increased to 4.23±0.40, but it was only 2.08±0.17 or 
1.43±0.25 in the cells pre-treated CVEcitrus at 0.5 mg/ml or 1.0 mg/
ml for 1 h and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h, respectively (Fig. 
6). 

Caspase-3 enzyme activity assay
Caspase-3 enzyme activity was measured using DEVD-peptide-
nitroanilide (pNA). After incubation with 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h, 
the amount of DEVD-pNA cleaved was significantly increased 
from 4.31±0.14 pmol (control value) to 10.43±0.70 pmol, but this 
was only 6.46±0.49 pmol by pre-treatment with CVEcitrus at 1 mg/
ml for 1 h and exposed to 0.5 mM SNP for 24 h. The present results 
demonstrated that SNP increased caspase-3 enzyme activity in 
SK-N-MC cells and that CVEcitrus attenuated this increase (Fig. 7).

DISCUSSION

In the brain, NO is synthesized by neuronal nitric oxide synthase 
(NOS) and acts as an intercellular messenger at the physiological 
level. However, the high concentrations of NO induced by certain 
pathological conditions, such as brain ischemia, inflammation, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and may result in neuronal 
dysfunction (Heales et al., 1999; Murphy, 1999; Lee et al., 2010). 
NO also causes apoptotic neuronal cell death (Lee et al., 2005). In 
the present study, we investigated whether Coriolus versicolor has 
a protective effect on NO-induced cell death in SK-N-MC cells, a 
neuroblastoma cell line.
Our MTT assay results showed that SK-N-MC cell viability was

significantly reduced by SNP treatment, and that CVEcitrus exerted 
a significant protective effect against NO-induced cytotoxicity. 
However, CVEsynthetic showed no protective effect and CE has a 
little protective effect. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA contents 
showed an increase in the population of cells in the sub-G1 phase 
after SNP treatment, whereas the cells pre-treated with CVEcitrus 
prior to SNP showed a decrease in the sub-G1 phase. Under 
the phase-contrast microscope, the cells treated with SNP only 
showed apoptotic morphologies, i.e., cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic 
condensation, and irregularity in shape. Moreover, apoptotic 
bodies were observed in the SNP-treated cells stained with DAPI. 
However, the cells pre-treated with CVEcitrus prior to SNP showed 
lower levels of apoptotic morphologic changes. 
In addition, TUNEL-positive cells, indicative of apoptotic DNA 
strand breaks and nicks in DNA molecules, were detected in the 
SNP-treated cells, but the cells showed lower levels of TUNEL-
positive cells. To provide evidence supporting the involvement of 
apoptosis in the SNP-induced cytotoxicity, the DNA fragmentation 
assay was performed. Distinctive ladder pattern characteristic of 
apoptotic cell death was detected in the cells treated with SNP, on 
the other hand pre-treatment with CVEcitrus prior to SNP showed 
lower SNP-induced DNA laddering intensity.
The present results showed that apoptosis is closely implicated 
to NO-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-
MC cells and that CVEcitrus has a protective effect against this 
cytotoxicity. Molecular mechanisms underlying the NO-mediated 
apoptosis involve different pathways which depend on cell type 
and the cellular environment (Bosca and Hortelano, 1999). 
Many studies have demonstrated that NO-induced apoptosis 
occurs through a p53-dependent pathway in various cells 
including neuronal cells (Yung et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005). It was 
demonstrated that NO enhances p53 protein expression and its 
phosphorylation in myoblast cells (Lee et al., 2005). The present 
study also showed that NO increased p53 protein expression and 
its phosphorylation at Thr 18 in SK-N-MC cells.
Apoptosis-regulatory proteins have been repeatedly implicated 
in the susceptibility of neurons to cell death (Xu et al., 2007; 
Kim et al., 2010; Baek et al., 2011). Caspase-3 is one of the most 
widely studied members of the caspase family and it is involved 
in apoptosis as the principal executor (Cohen, 1997; Kim et 
al., 2010). Several pathways have been shown to mediate p53-
induced apoptosis, and Bax is a well known p53 target gene 
and a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (Miyashita and 
Reed, 1995; McCurrach et al., 1997). Bax promotes the release of 
cytochrome c into the cytosol from mitochondria, which in turn 
activates caspase-3 (Reed, 1995; Upadhyay et al., 2003). In the 
present study, we observed that SNP increased Bax expressions at 

the mRNA and protein levels in SK-N-MC cells, and that it finally 
increased caspase-3 enzyme activity. We further investigated 
whether CVEcitrus inhibits NO-related cell death pathways 
involving p53, Bax, and caspase. Our results showed that CVEcitrus 
attenuated NO-induced apoptotic cell death by blocking a p53- 
and Bax-dependent caspase-3 pathway. Suppression of DNA 
fragmentation and caspase-3 expression is known to be closely 
related with inhibition of apoptosis of neurons, resulting in 
facilitation of memory recovery (Quindry et al., 2007; Ko et al., 
2009; Baek et al., 2011).
Under normal conditions, NO modulates many physiological 
functions including neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and 
memory in the mammalian central nervous system (Hawkins, 
1996; Hölscher, 1997). However, under excessive NO formation 
conditions, NO exerts neurotoxicity inducing apoptosis, and 
NO-induced apoptosis causes many brain disorders (Gross and 
Wolin, 1995; Dawson and Dawson, 1996). The present study 
showed that CVEcitrus reduced NO-induced apoptotic cell death 
in a neuroblastoma cell line. The pro-apoptotic proteins, p53- 
and Bax, are known to activate caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis. 
The possible mechanisms of neuroprotective effect of CVEcitrus 
can be ascribed to the inhibition of p53- and Bax-dependent 
caspase-3 activation. Our results suggest that CVEcitrus potentially 
has therapeutic value in the treatment of a variety of NO-induced 
brain diseases such as stroke.
