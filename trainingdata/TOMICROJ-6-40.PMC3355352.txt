Abstract: We present data on pneumococcal carriage before the introduction of the heptavalent-pneumococcal conjugated 
vaccine  (PCV7)  in  Denmark.  In  the  pre-PCV7  period,  the  incidence  of  invasive  pneumococcal  disease  (IPD)  among 
children younger than 5 years was approximately 25 per 100.000 population, with the highest incidence rates observed in 
children  younger  than  2  years  of  age.  The  study  included  437  children  aged  12-72  months  attending  day  care  centres 
(DCC)  and  was  conducted  during  48  months.  In  total,  56%  (n=247)  of  children  were  pneumococcal  carriers  with  the 
highest  prevalence  in  children  aged  12–23  months  (69%),  the  proportion  significantly  declining  with  increasing  age. 
PCV7  serotypes  accounted  for  33%,  PCV10  for  34%,  and  PCV13  for  57%  of  all  carried  isolates.  The  proportion  of 
serotypes included in the three conjugate vaccines was higher among IPD isolates compared to carrier isolates (range 35–
90%). We found that the frequency of carriage was high among Danish pre-school children attending DCC and serotypes 
were not frequently covered by PCV7 in the pre-PCV7 period.

INTRODUCTION 
Infections  caused  by  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  are 
 
major  contributors  to  morbidity  and  the  main  cause  of 
vaccine preventable deaths in children younger than 5 years 
of  age  worldwide  [1,  2].  The  range  of  infections  caused  
by  pneumococci  is  wide  and  often  preceded  by  the 
asymptomatic  carrier  state  in  the  nasopharynx,  mainly  in 
pre-school children [3]. From the nasopharynx, it may spread 
into  the  upper  airway  and  middle  ear,  and  cause  mucosal, 
non-invasive  disease,  but  can  also  invade  sterile  sites,  such 
as  blood  and  cerebrospinal  fluid,  causing  severe  invasive 
pneumococcal disease (IPD).  
immunosuppression 
 
including  HIV-1 
like 
crowding,  and  temporal  association  to  respiratory  viral 
diseases  widely  affect  the  risk  of  IPD  [4].  In  particular,  a 
high  carriage  prevalence  has  been  associated  with  high 
incidences  of  pneumococcal  disease,  including  IPD  [5]. 
Attendance  to day care centres (DCC) has been recognized 
as an important risk factor both with regard to acquisition of 
pneumococcal carriage and infections in pre-school children 
[6, 7]. In Denmark, it is estimated that between 55–85 % of 
children between 6 months and 5 years attend a DCC [6, 8].  
  The 
vaccine 
(PCV7,  Pfizer  Vaccines)  has  been  shown  to  be  highly 
effective  in  reducing  IPD  caused  by  vaccine  serotypes  in 
both  vaccinated  and  non-vaccinated  cohorts  [9-12].  PCV7

was  introduced  in  the  Danish  childhood  immunization 
programme in a 2+1 schedule in October 2007; before that, 
PCV7  was  only  recommended  for  children  younger  than  2 
years  of  age  with  high-risk  conditions  [13,  14].  In  the  pre-
PCV7 period, the incidence of IPD among children younger 
than 5 years in Denmark was approximately 25 per 100.000 
population,  with  the  highest  incidence  rates  observed  in 
children younger than 2 years of age [15]. The incidence of 
IPD  nearly  halved  shortly  after  the  introduction  of  the 
vaccine  [16].  Pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccines  of  higher 
valence, including the 10-valent pneumococcal non-capsulate 
H. 
influenzae  protein-D  conjugate  vaccine  (PhiD-CV; 
PCV10;  GlaxoSmithKline  Biologicals)  and  the  13-valent 
pneumococcal  protein  conjugate  vaccine  (PCV13;  Pfizer 
Vaccines) provide broader serotype coverage [11, 15, 17, 18]. 
PCV13  was  started  to  be  used  in  Denmark  in  April  2011 
[28]. 
  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  describe  the  serotype 
distribution  of  pneumococcal 
the 
nasopharynx of non-vaccinated infants attending DCCs in a 
local  Danish  district  and  in  the  pre-PCV7  period  and  to 
compare  the  proportion  of  serotypes  included  in  three 
conjugate vaccines among carried and IPD isolates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study Setting and Design 
  We performed a cross-sectional study in order to evaluate 
the  prevalence  of  pneumococcal  nasopharyngeal  carriage 
among  children  aged  12–72  months  attending  27  DCCs  
in  the  Municipality  of  Roskilde,  Region  Zealand  during 
1999–2000.  Nurseries,  kindergartens  and  combined  DCCs 
(including  both  a  nursery  and  a  kindergarten  in  one

institution) were eligible to be included in the study. In total, 
437 children aged 12–72 months were included in the study. 
  Written informed consents were obtained from children’s 
parents.  The  study  was  approved  by  The  Regional  Ethical 
Committee  (register  number  KF  01–371/98  and  KF  11–
094/00),  the  Department  of  Children  and  Culture  in  the 
Municipality  of  Roskilde,  and  the  Danish  Data  Protection 
Agency  (registry  number  2001–41–1214).  An  analysis  of  a 
subgroup of this study population was previously presented 
by Auranen et al., [19] including only 3 DCCs out of the 27 
DCCs. 

Sampling and Identification of Pneumococcal Isolates 
 
Sampling  was  performed  as  previously  described  by 
Kaltoft et al., [17]. Briefly, a trained person collected a deep 
nasopharyngeal  sample  using  a  calcium  alginate-tipped 
aluminum wire swab (Calgi swab type 1, Puritan, Hardwood 
Products Company LP, USA). The swab was inserted into a 
test tube containing 1.5 ml serum broth and kept at 5°C until 
it  was  plated  in  the  laboratory  within  3–5  hours  after 
sampling.  Pneumococcal 
identified  and 
serotyped  at  the  Neisseria  and  Streptococcus  Reference 
Centre (NSR), Statens Serum Institut as previously described 
[16, 20].  
  The serotypes included in PCV7 are 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19F,  and  23F.  PCV10  includes  PCV7  serotypes  plus 
serotypes  1,  5,  and  7F;  and  PCV13  includes  PCV10 
serotypes plus serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A.

Data Analysis 
  Categorical data were compared using chi-square test, p-
values ≤0.05 were considered significant. The proportion of 
children who were pneumococcal carriers by age group was 
estimated  and  expressed  as  carrier  rates  (CR).  Also,  we 
calculated  the  proportion  of  PCV7,  PCV10  and  PCV13 
serotypes among IPD isolates by age group using data from 
the nationwide laboratory surveillance system [21].

RESULTS 
  At 
the 
nasopharyngeal  sample  was  found  in  56.5%  of  all  children 
(n=247),  54%  of  the  247  children  were  males.  A  second 
serotype  was  found  in  9%  of  children  (n=22).  The  highest 
prevalence  of  pneumococcal  carriage,  69%  (n=27),  was 
found  among  the  youngest  children  (age  12–23  months)  
and  tended  to  decline  each  year  dropping  to  a  carriage  
rate of 53.8% at five years of age and to 46.2% at six years 
of age.  
  The serotypes included in PCV7 accounted for 33%, 34% 
were  PCV10  serotypes,  and  57%  were  PCV13  serotypes 
among  all  carried  isolates,  with 
the  highest  serotype 
coverage  of  the  vaccines  among  the  youngest  children. 
Serotypes  found  in  children  aged  either  12–23  or  24–35 
months  were  mainly  those  included  as  additional  serotypes 
contained in PCV13. In children from  the age group 36–47 
months  and  older,  non-vaccine  serotypes  were  more 
frequently  observed  (Fig.  1).  The  serotype  coverage  of  the 
three  conjugate  vaccines  was  higher  in  IPD  compared  to 
carrier 
isolates  (range  35–90%),  differing  significantly 

the  groups 

(p=  0.001,  p=<0.001,  p=0.006 
between 
respectively) (Fig. 2). Also, the proportion of carriage isolates 
covered  by  PCV7  and  PCV13  decreased  significantly  with 
an increasing age (p=0.04 and p=0.001 respectively).  

DISCUSSION 
  To our knowledge, this is the largest report documenting 
the prevalence of pneumococcal serotypes in nasopharyngeal 
carriage  in  pre-school  children  before  the  introduction  of 
PCV7 into the Danish Childhood Immunization Programme. 
We  found  a  high  prevalence  of  pneumococcal  carriage, 
highest  in  children  aged  12–23  months,  where  nearly  
70%  were  carriers.  Serotypes  included  in  PCV7  were  not 
commonly  represented,  only  in  about  30%  of  carried 
isolates.  
  We  found  that  both  the  carrier  rates  and  the  serotype 
distribution of carried isolates varied markedly with age. The 
high  prevalence  of  carriage  among  the  youngest  children 
coincides  with  the  observation  that  the  incidence  of  IPD  is 
highest in this age group [8]. Paediatric serotypes/groups (6, 
14, 19 and 23) were found frequently both in carriers and as 
a  cause  of  IPD  in  the  youngest  children  in  the  pre-PCV7 
period. These serotypes/groups are all represented in PCV7, 
explaining  the  higher  coverage  of  the  PCV7  among  IPD 
cases  in  children  <23  months,  for  whom  vaccination  is 
attempted (Fig. 2). The predominance of serotypes included 
in  PCV7  declined  significantly  with  increasing  age,  both 
among  carriers  and  IPD  cases,  in  accordance  with  findings 
reported  from  other  populations  [2,  9].  Serotype  5  is  not  a 
frequent  cause  of  paediatric  IPD 
in  Denmark,  while 
serotypes 1 and 7F become more important in IPD in older 
children and adults [8, 16]; all these factors may determine a 
relatively low coverage of PCV10 among carried isolates in 
our  study  population.  The  higher  serotype  coverage  of 
PCV13 was mainly related to the presence of serotype 6A in 
both  carriage  and  in  IPD  (Fig.  2).  These  findings  are 
comparable  to  those  reported  from  a  number  of  carriage 
studies  from  different  geographic  locations  [7,  11,  22,  23]. 
Also, the analysis of risk factors for the carriage of vaccine 
serotypes  showed  that  age,  gender,  size  of  DCC,  type  of 
DCC,  and  month  of  sampling  were  not  found  to  be 
significantly associated with an increased risk of carrying an 
isolate belonging to a serotype included in PCV7, PCV10 or 
PCV13 (data not shown).  
  The  pneumococcal  capsular  polysaccharide  has  been 
described as a major determinant of the duration of carriage, 
relative  invasiveness,  disease  presentation  and  mortality 
related to IPD [13, 20]. It also appears that the biochemical 
structure  of  the  capsule  determines  the  success  of  a  given 
serotype  in  nasopharyngeal  carriage  [24].  In  spite  of 
differences  in  study  design  and  population,  a  number  of 
studies have identified a few serotypes as having the greatest 
invasive  potential.  Similar  to  our  findings,  a  study  from 
Gambia  reported  that  serotypes/groups  1,  12  and  14  were 
more frequently found in patients with severe pneumococcal 
disease  than  in  carriers,  while  serogroups  19  and  23  were 
often  isolated  from  healthy  controls  [5].  In  a  study  from 
India,  serotypes/groups  1,  5,  7,  12  were  prevalent  among 
invasive isolates, but not among carriers [25]. Also, a study

*The serotypes included in the seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) are serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. The 
10-valent pneumococcal non-capsulate H. influenzae protein-D conjugate vaccine (PCV10) includes PCV7 serotypes plus serotypes 1, 5 and 
7F, and the 13-valent pneumococcal protein conjugate vaccine (PCV13) includes PCV10 serotypes plus serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A. 
 
from Papua New Guinea [26] reported that serogroups 11, 15 
and 22 were of low invasiveness, similar to what we found in 
our  study.  A  study  from  Oxford  reported  that  PCV7 
serotypes  showed  to  be  associated  with  high  invasiveness 
[27]. The consistency between these reports supports the fact 
that  the  invasiveness  of  capsular  serotypes  is  a  serotype-
specific characteristic. However, even if capsular serotype is 
a  factor  that  determines  the  invasiveness  of  a  particular 
strain, the study population may determine the prevalence of 
host-related  factors  (such  as  genetic  predisposition,  the 
prevalence  of  co-morbid  conditions  and  socioeconomic 
factors), which influence the invasiveness of serotypes.  
 
In  conclusion,  pneumococcal  colonization  in  children 
attending DCCs is frequent, highest in the youngest infants, 
and represents a heterogeneous population of pneumococcal 
serotypes.  Studies 
the  nasopharyngeal 
pneumococcal  carriage  in  the  coming  years  would  be  of 
major  interest  in  order  to  evaluate  the  dynamics  of  the 
pneumococcal population in the post-PCV7 period.
