RENCO has the following benefits: (a) it explicitly models protein protein interactions among transcription factors, (b) it captures combinatorial control of transcription factors on target genes and (c) it produces output in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format, which allows these equations to be directly imported into existing simulators.
Explicit modeling of the protein interactions allows RENCO to incorporate greater mechanistic detail of the transcription machinery compared to existing models and can provide a better assessment of algorithms for regulatory network inference.

1 INTRODUCTION  With the increasing availability of genome-scale data, a plethora of algorithms are being developed to infer regulatory networks.
Examples of such algorithms include Bayesian networks, ARACNE (Bansal et al., 2007).
Because of the absence of   ground truth   of regulatory network topology, these algorithms are evaluated on artificial networks generated via network simulators (Kurata et al., 2003  Margolin et al., 2005  Mendes et al., 2003  Schilstra and Bolouri, 2002).
Since gene regulation is a dynamic process, existing network simulations employ systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the kinetics of mRNA and protein concentrations as a function of time.
Some approaches construct highly detailed models, but require large amounts of user- specified information (Kurata et al., 2003  Schilstra and Bolouri, 2002).
Other approaches generate large networks but use simpler models by making the mRNA concentration of target genes dependent upon mRNA concentration, rather than on protein  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
concentration of transcription factors (Mendes et al., 2003).
In real biological systems, protein expression does not correlate with gene expression, especially at steady state, due to different translation and degradation rates (Belle et al., 2006).
These approaches also do not model protein interactions edges and, therefore, combinatorics resulting from these interactions.
We describe a regulatory network generator, RENCO, that models genes and proteins as separate entities, incorporates protein protein interations among the transcription factor proteins, and generates ODEs that explicitly capture the combinatorial control of transcription factors.
RENCO accepts either pre-specified network topologies or gene counts, in which case it generates a network topology.
The network topology is used to generate ODEs that capture combinatorial control among transcription factor proteins.
The output from RENCO is in SBML format, compatible with existing simulators such as Copasi (Hoops et al., 2006) and RANGE (Long and Roth, 2007).
Time-series and steady-state expression data produced from the ODEs from our generator can be leveraged for comparative analysis of different network inference algorithms.
2 TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY  NETWORK GENERATOR  RENCO works in two steps: (a) generate/read the network topology and (b) generate the ODEs specifying the transcrip- tion kinetics (see RENCO manual for details).
For (a) proteins are connected to each other via a scale-free network (Albert and Barabasi, 2000), and to genes via a network with exponential degree distribution (Maslov and Sneppen, 2005).
2.1 Modeling combinatorial control of gene regulation  We model combinatorial control by first identifying the set of cliques, C, up to a maximum of size t in the protein interaction network.
Each clique represents a protein complex that must function together to produce the desired target regulation.
A target gene, gi is regulated by k randomly selected such cliques, where k is the indegree of the gene.
These k cliques regulate gi by binding in different combinations, thus exercising combina- torial gene regulation.
We refer to the set of cliques in a combination as a transcription factor complex (TFC).
At any time there can be several such TFCs regulating gi.
The mRNA concentration of a target gene is, therefore, a function of three  ß 2008 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ by-nc/2.0/uk/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.
types of regulation: within-clique, within-complex and across- complex regulation.
Within-clique regulation captures the contribution of one clique on a target gene.
The within- complex regulation captures the combined contribution of all cliques in one TFC.
Finally, the across-complex regulation specifies the combined contribution of different TFCs.
We now introduce the notation for ODEs generated by RENCO.
Mi (t) and Pi (t) denote the mRNA and protein M concentrations, respectively, of gene gi, at time t. Vi denote the rate constants of mRNA synthesis and degradation P denote the rate constants of protein synthesis of gi.
Vi and degradation.
Cij and Tij denote a protein clique and a TFC, respectively, associated with gi.
Qi denotes the set of TFCs associated with gi.
Xij, Yij and Si specify the within-clique, within-complex and across-complex regulation on gi.

Similarly for protein concentra- tion, dPiðtÞ=dt ¼ VP P The across-complex regulation, Si is a weighted sum of jQij contributions from jQij TFCs: Si ¼ q¼1 wqYiq, where wq denotes the TFC weight.
The sum models  or  behavior of the different TFCs because all TFCs need not be active simulta- Q neously.
The within-complex regulation, Yij is a product jTijj of within-clique actions in the TFC Tij, Yij ¼ c¼1 Xic.
The product models  and  behavior of a single TFC because all proteins within a TFC must be active at the same time.
Finally, the cliques per gene Cij are randomly assigned activating or repressing roles on gi.
If Cij is activating,  Q  Xij ¼  Q  jCijj p¼1 PpðtÞ Q p¼1 PpðtÞ   jCijj jCijj p¼1 Kaip þ  otherwise,  Xij ¼  Q  jCijj p¼1 Kiip Q p¼1 PpðtÞ : jCijj jCijj p¼1 Kiip þ  Q  Kaip and Kiip are equilibrium dissociation constants of the pth activator or repressor of gi.
All degradation, synthesis and dissociation constants are initialized uniformly at random from ½0:01  Vmax , where Vmax is user specified.
3 EXAMPLE NETWORK  We used RENCO to analyze : (a) mRNA and protein steady- state measurements and (b) combinatorial gene regulation, in a small example network (Supplementary Material has details).
3.1  Importance of modeling protein expression  The example network has five genes and five proteins (Fig.
1a).
The gene G4 is regulated via different combinations of the cliques fP2g fP0  P1g.
We find that the wild-type time courses of individual mRNA expressions are correlated with correspond- ing proteins (Fig.
1b and c).
But because different genes and proteins have different degradation and synthesis rate constants, the mRNA population as a whole does not correlate with the  Regulatory networks with combinatorial control  25  20  15  10  5  G0 G1 G2 G3 G4  0  50  0  50  100  150  200  250  300  350  400  450  Timestep (b)  600  500  400  300  P0 P1 P2 P3 P4  i  n o s s e r p x E e n e G     i  n o s s e r p x E n e     i  t  o r P  200  100  0  50  0  50  100  150  200  250  300  350  400  450  (a)  Timestep (c)  Fig.

protein population (Spearman s correlation ¼ 0:3).
Because of the dissimilarity in the steady-state mRNA and protein expres- sion populations, genes appearing to be differentially expressed at the mRNA level may not be differentially expressed at the protein level.
This highlights the importance of modeling mRNA and protein expression as separate entities in the network.
3.2 Combinatorics of gene regulation  We analyzed combinatorial control in our network by generat- ing the G4 time course under different knockout combinations of the G4 activators, P0  P1 and P2 (Fig.
2).
Because all the regulators are activating, G4 is downregulated here compared to wild-type.
We note that each knock out combination yields different time courses.
In particular, knocking out either G0 or G1 in combination with G2 is sufficient to drive the G4 expression the clique, P0  P1.

This phenomenon is because of  1319   S.Roy et al.
This illustrates a possible combinatorial regulation process to produce a range of expression dynamics using a few transcrip- tion factors.
4 CONCLUSION  We have described RENCO, a generator for artificial regulatory networks and their ODEs.
RENCO models the transcriptional machinery more faithfully by explicitly captur- ing protein interactions and provides a good testbed for network structure inference algorithms.
