The introduction of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in infectious disease research has allowed
standardized typing of bacterial clones. Through multiple markers around the genome,
it is possible
to determine the sequence type (ST) of bacterial isolates to establish the population structure of a species.
For the periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis, the MLST scheme has been established at
www.pubmlst.org/pgingivalis, and data from the database indicate a high degree of genetic diversity and a
weakly clonal population structure comparable with Neisseria menigitidis. The major fimbriae (FimA) have
been held responsible for the adhesive properties of P. gingivalis and represent an important virulence factor.
The fimA genotyping method (PCR based) indicate that fimA genotype II, IV and Ib are associated with
diseased sites in periodontitis and tissue specimens from cardiovascular disease. fimA genotyping of the
isolates in the MLST database supports the association of genotypes II and IV with periodontitis. As a result
of multiple positive PCR reactions in the fimA genotyping, sequencing of the fimA gene revealed only minor
nucleotide variation between isolates of the same and different genotypes, suggesting that the method should
be redesigned or re-evaluated. Results from several
investigations indicate a higher intraindividual
heterogeneity of P. gingivalis than found earlier. Detection of multiple STs from one site in several patients
with refractory periodontitis, showed allelic variation in two housekeeping genes indicating recombination
between different clones within the periodontal pocket.

The development in high throughput sequencing of

DNA through the last decades and subsequent
full genome sequencing of bacterial species accel-
erated the possibility for microbiologists to investigate
genetic variation of bacterial strains by different typing
techniques (1, 2). Three classes of genes can be identified
in prokaryotes:
informational, core housekeeping, and
hypervariable genes. Informational genes are essential
for central metabolism and are related to transcription,
translational, and regulatory pathways, whereas the core
housekeeping genes are ubiquitous and coding for other
essential proteins. Both classes evolve at a slow rate and
are necessary for survival of the cell. On the contrary, the
hypervariable genes encode for surface proteins interact-
ing with the host, and for pathogenic species they may be
associated with virulence. This class of genes evolve at an

accelerated rate compared to the former due to the
necessity for the bacterial cell to adapt to variable host
conditions (1). Thus, studies of variation in the two
different groups of genes (housekeeping and hypervari-
able) may reflect different aspects of characterization of
pathogenic bacterial strains.

Housekeeping genes

Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, population
genetic models
Before nucleotide sequencing was available, genetic
variation could be investigated within a bacterial popula-
tion by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). The
technique was based on variation in electrophoretic
mobility of the products of several housekeeping genes,
where the mobility variants of the enzymes were directly
equated with alleles at the corresponding locus. The
variants were used to define an allelic profile of each
isolate where the acquired electrophoretic types had the

Fig. 1. Models of genetic population structures of prokaryotes (5) (ﬁgure adapted from Kilian et al. (10)). The population
structure in A is fully clonal at all levels where no recombination occurs either between isolates in the same, or in different
branches of the tree (strong linkage disequilibrium between alleles). B shows a panmictic population structure with
recombination at all levels in the population with random association of alleles. C illustrates an epidemic population structure

main advantage of being directly related to the variation
at the chromosome.

Large-scale MLEE surveys of many pathogens per-
formed in the 1980s suggested that most bacterial
populations were highly clonal
(Fig. 1) because the
majority of isolates seemed to belong to a small number
of clusters of closely related genotypes (3, 4). Further-
more, the repeated recovery of identical isolates from
diverse geographic origin, many years apart, was also
interpreted as a low rate of homologous recombination in
natural bacterial populations, also supporting the clonal
population structure paradigm (46) (Fig. 1). In this
model, vertical descent of genetic information from
mother to daughter cells occurs, and the changes are
only caused by point mutations in the chromosome.
Based on the MLEE investigations, the clonal paradigm
remained central for the understanding of genetic varia-
tion of bacterial populations until the beginning of the
1990s. However, as early as in 1986, results from a MLEE
study of isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from subjects
with systemic disease and healthy carriers gave clear
indications of a substantial rate of recombination within
isolates of the species (7).

Horizontal exchange of genetic material in prokaryotes
can occur through several mechanisms: Transduction
refers to horizontal transfer of DNA among bacteria
that have the common property of being infected by a
specific bacterial virus; transformation refers to bacterial
uptake of DNA from the environment, whereas conjuga-
tion involves a cell to cell contact-dependent horizontal
gene transfer. When recombinational events occur to a
large extent with rearrangement of the bacterial chromo-

the population structure becomes non-
clonal, panmictic or free recombining (Fig. 1). In a non-
clonal population structure model, genetic variation is
randomly assorted and with no evidence of
lineage
structure and no congruence of gene trees (5). With the

accumulation of MLEE data and later the increasing use
of nucleotide sequencing, it became evident that genetic
variation at housekeeping loci in many bacterial species
accumulated as frequently by homologous recombination
as by point mutation (3, 5, 8). It also became evident
from these data, in particular from those on N. meningi-
tidis, that closely related clones, designated clonal com-
plexes, could arise from an underlying recombining
background population, defining another

Multilocus sequence typing
The introduction of
the multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) method in infectious disease research has
allowed the identification of bacterial clones
in a
standardized manner, by making data comparable be-
tween laboratories, using high throughput sequencing of
fragments of housekeeping genes as determinants. The
method derived from MLEE, with use of multiple
markers, scattered physically around the genome, requires
knowledge of approximately 450 bp fragments of at least
seven ubiquitous, core housekeeping genes (1, 11). Gene
fragments are amplified by PCR and sequenced for
determination of
the
MLST detects allelic variation at multiple housekeeping
loci accumulating slowly in the bacterial population. The
discriminatory power is achieved by the analysis of the
DNA sequence of fragments detecting the degree of
genetic diversity within the population of interest. The
combination of the different alleles for a selected strain
will assign the strain to a certain sequence type (ST)
number according to earlier recordings of other STs.

the nucleotide sequence. Thus,

Soon after the introduction of the MLST for N.
meningitidis (11), other schemes were developed for
several prokaryotic (6) and eukaryotic pathogens such
as Candida albicans (12) and Candida glabrata (13). Since

then MLST schemes have also been created for numerous
bacteria, among them Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campy-
lobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella spp.,
Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus
influenzae and
Bacillus cereus (1420).

MLST data generated throughout the last decade have
contributed to both epidemiologic surveillance and
fundamental studies of pathogen biology (2, 8, 21).
Thus, MLST is a well-established and good method to
detect genetic diversity of bacterial pathogens and well
suited to study large strain collections of broad origin for
long-term molecular epidemiology. Furthermore,
the
method has provided numerous insights into epidemiol-
ogy and population genetics of bacterial populations (2).
An overview of
the MLST schemes for pathogenic
organisms can be accessed at several MLST websites
existing on the
(http://pubmlst.org/databa-
ses.shtml), and MLST databases are hosted at several
institutions around the world (the University of Oxford,
UK (http://pubmlst.org) (22); Imperial College, London,
UK (http://www.mlst.net/databases/) (9); the Environ-
mental Resarch Institute, Cork, Ireland, (http://mlst.uc-
c.ie), at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France (http://www.
pasteur.fr/recherche/genopole/PF8/mlst), at the Univer-
sity of Oslo, Oslo, Norway (http://mlstoslo.uio.no), and at
The University of Hong Kong).

Internet

The largest MLST database, for Neisseria spp. (http://
pubmlst.org/neisseria), contains at date 8,972 distinct
allelic profiles or STs, differentiated among 18,584
isolates.

However, recent advances in technology have further
improved DNA sequence capability and increased the
discriminatory power of sequence-based data beyond the
MLST method, in bacterial populations where levels of
nucleotide diversity are too low. These improvements
have resulted in the detection of single nucleotide
polymorphisms, small
insertions, deletions, and other
detailed genetic variation (2, 23).

The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas
gingivalis
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a small black-pigmented
anaerobic rod-shaped bacteria, belonging to the oral
microbiota. Most commonly,
it can be detected in
subgingival biofilms in coaggregation with other species,
among them Fusobacterium spp. and Streptococcus gor-
donii (24, 25). It is one of the main periodontal pathogens
involved in the initiation and progression of periodontal
diseases and can be detected in patients with various forms
of periodontitis (2630). Furthermore, it belongs to the
‘red complex’ bacteria together with Treponema denticola
and Tannerella forsythia recognized as a microbial in-
dicator of progression of chronic periodontitis (31, 32).

For a long time, it was assumed to be related only to
diseased periodontal sites because it was not possible to

culture from healthy gingival sulci. However, improved
techniques have made detection possible also in healthy
sites (3335) as well as in other parts of the oral cavity
(lateral part and dorsum of the tongue), located to niches
with growth conditions favoring its special requirements
(36).

The species harbors a number of virulence factors, e.g.
fimbriae,
lipopolysaccharide, collagenase, and cysteine
proteinases (gingipains) (27, 28, 3741) and is capable of
invading host tissue cells that may protect it from the
host’s immune system. Furthermore, new investigations
have also shown in vitro that the organism can survive
intracellularly in a nutritionally rich environment (28, 42,
43) and can be transmitted between different types of
host cells such as epithelial, endothelial, and smooth
muscle cells (43, 44).

Because of

the large pathogenic potential of P.
gingivalis, it is referred to as a molecular vampire (41).
In addition to being a major periodontal pathogen, it is
suggested to be a mediator in the development of
cardiovascular disease by spreading from the periodontal
pocket to the blood stream (4549).

The major fimbriae (FimA)
P. gingivalis’ ability to adhere to salivary components,
host cells, solid surfaces, and bacterial cells is facilitated
by its fimbriae (42, 4851). These are curly and filamen-
tous appendages arranged peritrichously on the cell
surface (50) and are essential for the early establishment
of infection by its adhesive properties. The fimbriae have
been classified into major and minor types (5054) and
have been extensively studied throughout the last decades.
It is constructed from a fimbrillin monomer subunit
protein of approximately 43 kDa as the main building
block (50), coded from the fimA gene. FimA has been
held directly responsible for many of
the adhesive
properties of the organism because of specifically binding
to and activation of various host cells (human epithelial,
endothelial, spleen, and peripheral blood monocytes),
resulting in the release of cytokines and several adhesion
molecules (28, 30, 42). The fimA gene occurs as a single
copy in the chromosome (29, 51, 53, 55), and it has been
classified into six types based on variation in nucleotide
sequence (genotype I, Ib, II, III, IV, and V) (49, 5558).
Several clinical studies have indicated that the variation
of the fimA gene is related to the virulence of different
strains of
In chronic periodontitis, P.
gingivalis isolates with fimA genotypes II, IV, and Ib
are significantly more prevalent than isolates with other
genotypes (5661). Studies concerning the pathogenic
potential of distinct genotypes also indicate that genotype
II is more prevalent in patients suffering from aggressive
periodontitis (62). In contrast, isolates with fimA geno-
type I are most prevalent among P. gingivalis positive
healthy adults, followed by genotype III and V (28).

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that recombi-
nant FimA protein corresponding to fimA genotype II
has greater ability to adhere to and invade human
epithelial cells than the FimA protein corresponding to
other genotypes (63). The pathogenic difference between
different genotypes has also been verified in animal
models supporting the hypothesis of variable virulence
because fimA II, Ib, and IV types are causing stronger
infectious symptoms and inflammatory changes than
strains harboring genotypes I and III (51, 6466).
Furthermore, mutants where the type I gene was sub-
stituted with type II showed an enhanced bacterial
adhesion/invasion of epithelial cells and vice versa (67).
However, a study of adhesion and invasion abilities of
different fimA genotypes of P. gingivalis in KB cells
(originally derived from epidermal carcinoma of the
mouth) did not indicate any significant difference be-
tween different genotypes, suggesting that other charac-
teristics besides the variation of the fimA gene also could
be responsible for the observations (10, 51, 68). In

that variation in pathogenic potentials and invasive

(69)

Frequently detected fimA type II and IV clones from
cardiovascular specimens of P. gingivalis-positive patients
also indicate a possible involvement of these in the
initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease
(70). Recent results (49) also indicate that fimA II, IV,
and Ib genotypes may be involved in the formation of
aortic aneurysms, and that the major characteristics of
aortic tissue with P. gingivalis infection were smooth
muscle cell proliferation in association with intense, local
inflammation.

Results from studies of periradicular infections also
indicate an association between P. gingivalis-specific fimA
genotypic clones (types II, IV, and Ib)
in primary
endodontic infections as well as chronic, apical period-
ontitis (71, 72).

MLST  P. gingivalis

The genetic diversity among strains of bacteria is a
reflection of nucleotide sequence differences in their
chromosomal genes. Before 2003, several molecular typ-
ing methods (MLEE, random amplified polymorphic
DNA fingerprinting, and ribotyping) were used to
characterize P. gingivalis strains (7376). The results of
these studies were contradictory when it came to popula-
tion structure of the species. However, in 2003, MLST was
first introduced for the species (77). To test the conclu-
sions from this study which indicated a panmictic
population structure of the organism, we investigated 38
isolates from various geographical origins (78). In addi-
tional studies (79), the overall results of the MLST

analysis represented a total of 84 isolates from human
periodontitis with an even broader geographic origin. Due
to the limited variation of one selected gene (nah)
observed both by Koehler et al. (77) and by Enersen
et al. (78), the MLST results presented in Enersen et al.
(79) were based on a seven loci scheme without the nah
gene. The proposed MLST modification in this paper with
exclusion of the nah gene, is an example of how important
the right genes is for keeping the

discriminatory power of
the method. The modified
MLST scheme forms the basis for the MLST website,
http://pubmlst.org/pgingivalis, set up in collaboration
with Dr. K. Jolly, University of Oxford and professor
D. A. Caugant, National Institute of Public Health, Oslo
(79).

Population structure
The evaluation of a new molecular technique on isolates
that have been studied earlier with other techniques is
important for assessing the discriminatory power of the
new method and for testing the strength of the conclu-
sions made earlier. In this comparison, the conclusion
from Enersen et al. (79) is in accordance with earlier
studies (73, 74), indicating that genetic exchange through
recombination may not be as extensive in P. gingivalis as
suggested by other investigators (76, 77).

Several methods can be used in the analysis of data in
population genetic studies. The MLST analysis software
S.T.A.R.T. 2 (Sequence Type Analysis and Recombina-
tional Tests) is a single package available at the http://
www.pubmlst.org (80). The standard MLST statistics,
number of polymorphic sites, average GC contents,
allele frequencies, phylogenetic trees and the calculation
of pairwise ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous
substitutions (dN/dS) can be calculated with the software,
as well as the index of association (7880).

The index of association, IA, has been used to
statistically estimate the degree of association between
alleles at different loci using one representative of each
ST in a bacterial population (5). Originally, from MLEE
data the IA value for Salmonella species was calculated to
be 1, a fully clonal species, while Neisseria gonorrhoeae
was estimated to be a panmictic species with IA close to 0
(5). Index of association can also be used in MLST
calculations (5, 22) (http://pubmlst.org/software/analysis/
start/manual/index_of_association.shtml).

For the P. gingivalis isolates in the MLST database, IA
is calculated to be 0.3704 (81), indicating a significant
linkage disequilibrium pointing to a weakly clonal
population structure. The standardized index of associa-

with the value estimated for N. gonorrhoeae (0.005),
characterized as a panmictic species undergoing extensive
recombination (5).

According to population genetic theory (83),

the
recovery of strains with identical or similar genotypes
sampled in different geographic areas as well as no
evidence of intragenic recombination (no mosaic genes)
support a significant degree of clonality of the species. It
is reasonable to assume that the explanation for the
results in our MLST investigations (79) could be the
inclusion of a larger strain population with a much
broader geographic origin, comparable to the studies by
Loos et al. and Menard and Mouton (73, 74), than in the
study by Koehler et al. (77).

At the moment, there are 138 STs in the MLST
database for P. gingivalis including the strains collected
from patients with ‘refractory’ periodontitis (79, 81, 84).
The UPGMA dendrogram presented in Fig. 2 shows the
genetic relationships among all the STs (one representa-
tive of each) in the database, and 30 clusters were
identified. Though the overall number of isolates of P.
gingivalis analyzed by MLST still is small compared to
databases of other bacterial pathogens, the dendrogram
verifies clusters of identical or closely related STs from
diverse geographic origins, which may be sampled years
apart. This is an observation that further supports the
substantial clonality and a low rate of homologous
recombination for the species.

Split decomposition analysis (85) is a tool for graphical
illustration of whether recombination plays a role in the
evolutionary history of the separate genes investigated in
the MLST. When utilizing the allelic profiles of the isolates
(seven gene fragments) (79) the obtained splitstree graph
visualizes the degree of recombination between the isolates
in the respective bacterial populations. The algorithm
utilized in the analysis create a tree-like structure when the
descent is clonal and bush-like structure when recombina-
tion plays a major role in the evolutionary history of the
genes investigated. The test can be performed for all
isolates with each of the gene fragments individually or for
the concatenated allele sequences. Based on the allelic
profiles of 138 STs in the MLST database (Fig. 3), this
analysis also strongly indicates the clonality of P. gingivalis
and is in accordance with the results from the other
presented methods. However, it is important to emphasize
that our results altogether only reflect a small population
of P. gingivalis strains.

Clonal heterogeneity within individuals,
recombination
The general acceptance that periodontal patients harbor a
single clonal type of P. gingivalis (8688) changed when

Porphyromonas gingivalis: a clonal pathogen?

Loos et al. (86) discovered by DNA fingerprinting that one
out of nine patients was infected with two clonal types.
Later, similar findings (intraindividual detection of two or
three clones) were interpreted as transient coinfections
(89, 90) of additional clones. The studies by Enersen et al.
(78, 79), through MLST analysis, revealed an even larger
clonal heterogeneity within different periodontitis pa-
tients. In three Indonesians, two, three and four distinct
STs were detected, respectively, from infected sites, and in
a Finnish patient two distinct STs were found. However,
the sampled sites in these studies were unknown.

The fact that P. gingivalis can be detected in diseased
periodontal sites and in healthy gingival sulci (33, 64, 86,
87) suggests that it is a species of variable pathogenic
potential, and single sites have been hypothesized to be
colonized by more virulent clones (49, 51, 87).

The diversity of P. gingivalis in single sites was
investigated by MLST in patients with ‘refractory’
periodontitis (84) (Fig. 4). The diagnosis represents cases
of treatment-resistant disease (91, 92) where a variable
number of sites may harbor clones of higher virulence.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the complexity of the
subgingival microbiota in periodontal disease could (87,
88) allow for the possibility of DNA exchange between
different strains in the same periodontal pocket. With
increasing number of cells over time in one infected site,
such events could represent fitness selection of surviving
clones with regard to local growth conditions as well as
the hosts immune response, which may contribute to
further progression of the disease (88).

The clonal diversity in single sites (84) demonstrated
colonization by multiple STs. In each of 15 ‘refractory’
it was detected from 81 STs
periodontal pockets,
(Fig. 4), and these results raise the question of a much
larger clonal diversity within a patient
than earlier
reported. The study (84),
in regard to virulence and
diagnosis, also shows the presence of two STs from two
different subjects that were previously recorded in the
MLST isolate database and represented strains sampled
from cases of aggressive periodontitis (92) in Germany
(ST14 and ST78) (www.pubmlst.org/pgingivalis). These
may well correspond to more virulent clones, as is the
case with other human pathogens (87).

Genetic variation accumulates in many bacterial species
at housekeeping loci as frequently by homologous recom-
bination (replacement of corresponding small chromoso-
mal segments from related strains) as by point mutations
(3, 88, 93, 94). Based on many MLST data sets from
several species, the eBURST program (www.mlst.net) was
developed to explore the diversification of closely related
bacterial strains on a short time scale (3, 9, 95).

The analysis by eBURST of the allelic profiles in single
periodontal pockets where more than three clones were
sampled (84) showed 10 clonal complexes defined by
single locus variants (9, 95) (Fig. 4). With the exception

different P. gingivalis strains to transfer chromosomal
DNA to each other by conjugation, representing an
example of the underlying mechanism for allele swapping
and the genetic variation of P. gingivalis (88). Further-
more, Frandsen et al. (76) showed signs of frequent
recombination by identifying a random distribution of
two virulence-associated mobile genetic elements among
their investigated strains.

fimA gene; genotyping and sequencing
Because the results of the studies summarized here (79,
81) provided further evidence of a high genetic diversity
and a clear indication of some degree of clonality of P.
gingivalis, an eventual association of virulence genes with
specific clones could be a valuable supplement to our
knowledge of the characteristics of the species. Thus, all
strains were investigated by fimA genotyping.

Eighty two P. gingivalis isolates were investigated by
the fimA genotyping method, a method used in a number
of studies with direct PCR technique on clinical material
for detection of prevalence of fimA genotypes from sites
with various periodontal conditions (5662). The results
from the cultured isolates confirmed the results from the
clinical investigations that fimA II and IV genotypes seem
to be predominant in chronic periodontitis-affected sites
(56, 60, 79).

The association of these genotypes to cardiovascular

disease has also been described earlier.

the presence of

A relatively high prevalence of isolates positive in PCR
for multiple fimA genotypes was observed in the two
bacterial populations (25.6 and 30.1%, respectively) (79),
similar to the reports from the clinical material in other
investigations (5661). Because the fimA gene occurs as a
single copy in the chromosome (53), detection of multiple
fimA genotypes in the clinical studies has been explained
by (1)
several different genotypes
colonizing the same site (56, 61), (2) the possible existence
of new unidentified genotypes (57, 58, 61), or (3) the
existence of fimA non-typable strains (presence of new
genotypes) (5660). All the investigated isolates in our
studies were typable. Because the investigation from
cultured isolates resulted in similar findings as in clinical
PCR studies, we anticipated that the reason for the
multiple positive PCR reactions could be a previously not
identified variation within the fimA gene.

In an attempt to explain these results (fimA genotyp-
ing), a set of universal primers were designed for the
purpose of sequencing the whole gene in a selected
number of isolates. These isolates were chosen based on
the results from the genotyping method, focusing mainly
on those with multiple positive PCR reactions to the
specific primers for fimA genotype I, Ib, and II because of
the high prevalence of these combinations. The reference
strains for genotype fimA III and V were also selected for
sequencing.

of one subject (7) (see later) (Fig. 4), the variation in each
periodontal site was only related to pepO and recA genes.
The alleles of these genes at each site showed multiple
identical polymorphic sites in non-adjacent nucleotides
with only one variable nucleotide between the alleles
(unpublished alignments) (84). Because recombination
generally occurs and involves larger segments of chro-
mosomal DNA than the fragments analyzed by MLST, it
is most likely that the same polymorphic sites in different
alleles of
the genes actually reflected recombination
rather than point mutations occurring within the inves-
tigated site. Furthermore, it is unlikely that multiple point
mutations would arise in the same polymorphic sites in
the different alleles. These findings are in accordance with
other studies concluding that recombination seems to
occur to a larger extent among bacterial species than
previously expected (9395). By calculation of the average
values of dN/dS which were B1 for both genes (average

data), the results of the variation indicated synonymous
substitutions with no change in gene products.

An especially noteworthy observation was detected in
one periodontal site. A very distinct clone (ST 109) was
observed in a clonal complex together with variants of
seven closely related others (Fig. 4). The observation
could be explained as an example of a recombinational
event in the allele of the affected recA gene of ST 109
giving rise to the other variants. This is supported by
Tribble et al.

Fig. 4. The degree of recombination between 93 isolates of P. gingivalis sampled from 15 single sites of ‘refractory’ periodontitis
patients is illustrated by a SplitsTree graph with superimposed results of the eBurst analysis to the graph. Patient/site numbers
are marked in bold. Several STs detected in each periodontal site are located in groups (circles/ellipses) except patients 2, 4, 6, 9
and 13 where only one ST was found per site. ST 109/patient 7; see text (84).

The analysis verified a conserved fimA gene with only
minor variations among the selected isolates, mainly
point mutations. Only one sign of recombination could
be detected for an isolate, indicating that a fragment from
fimA type III was inserted into the fimA type II gene of
another isolate. However, our multiple sequence align-
ments of the total fimA gene sequences resembled the
alignments published by Fujiwara et al.
(55), also
showing minor variations in single nucleotides of the
respective isolates.

The fimA genotyping from the clinical study of single
‘refractory’ periodontitis sites also revealed some sites
harboring isolates reacting to multiple specific PCR
primer sets. It is likely that the observations of multiple
reactions for a number of investigated strains in both
studies can be explained partly by the primer design of
the fimA genotyping method and partly by the small
variation of
the fimA gene between isolates. These
results put a question mark to the fimA genotyping
method,

Furthermore, results from alignment of the different

fimA genotyping vs. MLST
The relationship between the distribution of fimA geno-
types and MLST data of P. gingivalis has not been
investigated earlier. The tendency of clustering of the
fimA genotypes (79, 81) with isolates of the same or
closely related STs harboring the same fimA genotype
strengthens our conclusion of a weakly clonal population
structure of P. gingivalis, but with no strong relationship
between fimA genotypes and the STs identified (Fig. 2).
