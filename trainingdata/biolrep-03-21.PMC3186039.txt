Abstract
Adenosine—a purine nucleoside generated extracellularly from adenine nucleotides released by cells as a
result of direct stimulation, hypoxia, trauma, or metabolic stress—is a well-known physiologic and
pharmacologic agent. Recent studies demonstrate that adenosine, acting at its receptors, promotes wound
healing by stimulating both angiogenesis and matrix production. Subsequently, adenosine and its receptors
have also been found to promote fibrosis (excess matrix production) in the skin, lungs, and liver, but to
diminish cardiac fibrosis. A commonly ingested adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, blocks the
development of hepatic fibrosis, an effect that likely explains the epidemiologic finding that coffee drinking,
in a dose-dependent fashion, reduces the likelihood of death from liver disease. Accordingly, adenosine
may be a good target for therapies that prevent fibrosis of the lungs, liver, and skin.

Introduction
Although humans and other mammals have lost, for the
most part, the ability to regenerate injured tissue, the
capacity to heal wounds is of critical importance for
restoring function and, in the skin, maintaining a barrier
against the external environment. The processes involved
in wound healing include cleaning up the damaged tissue
and preventing tissue invasion by microorganisms
(inflammation), rebuilding the vascular network in
the wounded site and creating a scaffold of connective
tissue (granulation tissue formation), surfacing the
wound (re-epithelialization), and a much slower process
of re-organization of the scar. In some people, such as
individuals with diabetes or venous stasis, the process goes
awry and the wounds do not heal in a timely fashion or
at all. Although tissue repair is effective in re-establishing
a barrier,
the wound healing process may lead to
scarring, fibrosis, and loss of function (as in the case of
contractures). Internal organs may similarly be scarred and
the fibrosis and loss of architectural integrity may lead
to significant organ dysfunction. Moreover, some illnes-
ses, such as scleroderma, are characterized by pathologic
fibrosis of the skin and/or internal organs resulting in
diffuse skin fibrosis and internal organ dysfunction. Many

other ailments, such as liver cirrhosis, may lead to specific
organ destruction with resulting fibrosis, scarring, and loss
of function.

A variety of factors regulate the wound healing process,
ranging from growth factors to small molecules released
at the wounded site. One such factor is adenosine, a
ubiquitous purine nucleoside that is generated in the
extracellular space by dephosphorylation of adenine
nucleotides released by cells as a result of metabolic
factors,
injury, and hypoxia (Figure 1). Adenosine
mediates its effects on tissue regeneration and repair via
binding and activation of a family of G protein-coupled
receptors (adenosine A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors). In
this review, we will discuss the role of adenosine and its
receptors in wound healing, fibrosis, and scarring.

Adenosine in wound healing
Inflammation
The first step in wound healing involves the inflam-
matory response. Neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes/
macrophages, and basophils all play a role in eliminating
debris at injured sites, preventing infection of healing
tissue and secreting factors that promote recruitment of

Adenosine

Adenosine is formed both intracellularly and extracellularly from adenine
nucleotides, which are sequentially dephosphorylated to adenosine.
Intracellular adenosine may be transported into the extracellular space via
facilitated transport, and extracellular adenosine is also taken up by cells
through the same transporter, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1
(ENT1). Two cell surface molecules, CD39 and CD73 (nucleoside

-nucleotidase, respectively),

new blood vessels and restoration of injured tissue.
Adenosine, acting at its receptors, promotes the transi-
tion from a purely inflammatory role to promotion of
tissue restoration. Since the first demonstration that
adenosine suppresses inflammatory neutrophil
func-
tions in 1983 [1], it has been clear that adenosine, acting
primarily at A2A receptors, diminishes the inflammatory
functions of both blood-borne and tissue inflammatory
cells and even cells of the adaptive immune response
(reviewed in [2]). More recent studies demonstrate that
adenosine promotes macrophage differentiation into
M2-type macrophages [3-5], which help to promote
wound healing by releasing factors such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that stimulate restora-
tion of tissue at sites of injury (Figure 2).

Angiogenesis
In 1997, Montesinos and colleagues [6] first reported
that adenosine A2A receptor agonists promote wound
healing in mice. The mechanism by which adenosine A2A
receptor stimulation promoted wound healing was not
apparent at the time, although endothelial cells and the
vasculature were known to produce adenosine from
adenine nucleotides,
to respond to adenosine by
increasing their migration and proliferation, and to be
involved in stimulating vascular leakage and promoting
coronary vasodilation [7-11]. Thus, it was likely that

adenosine, acting at its receptors, directly promoted
angiogenesis, a key component of wound healing.
Subsequent studies demonstrated that adenosine A2A
receptor activation stimulates endothelial VEGF produc-
tion via both A2A and A2B receptors but that, in wounds,
the loss of adenosine A2A receptors completely abrogated
the formation of new blood vessels in the wounds
[12-16].
In addition to stimulating production of
angiogenic factors, adenosine A2A receptor activation
also inhibits the production of the antiangiogenic factor
thrombospondin 1 [15]. Moreover, in addition to the
direct effects of adenosine receptors on vascular endothe-
lium, adenosine stimulated macrophages to produce
angiogenic factors, such as VEGF [5,17]. Finally, adeno-
sine A2A receptor stimulation promotes recruitment of
bone marrow-derived endothelial precursor cells from
the circulation [18]. Overall, the evidence seems clear
that adenosine A2A receptor activation is involved in the
stimulation of at least one component of wound healing:
angiogenesis.

Dermal collagen production
It was clear from the original description of adenosine
receptor promotion of wound healing that adenosine
A2A receptor stimulation also increased matrix produc-
tion in the healing wounds. Fibroblasts produce matrix,
and human foreskin dermal fibroblasts were known to
express both adenosine A1 and A2 receptors [19], which
regulate intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine mono-
phosphate) levels. Further studies from my group
demonstrated that, in these cells, adenosine A2A receptor
stimulation directly promotes collagen production and
that, in some situations, this can be a two-edged sword
[20]. In a model of diffuse bleomycin-induced dermal
fibrosis, we showed that adenosine A2A receptor stimula-
tion is responsible for promotion of collagen produc-
tion in the skin, since adenosine A2A receptor knockout
mice or mice treated with an adenosine A2A receptor
antagonist are protected from developing diffuse dermal
fibrosis. This was later confirmed in experiments in mice
lacking adenosine deaminase. Mice lacking this enzyme
accumulate as much as 10-fold increases in adenosine
levels and undergo diffuse dermal fibrosis, which is
blocked by adenosine A2A receptor blockade. In addition
to direct stimulation of fibroblast collagen production,
adenosine also exacerbates collagen production by
promoting recruitment of bone marrow-derived fibro-
cytes from the circulation into the fibrotic skin.

Adenosine and fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis
As noted above, mice lacking adenosine deaminase suffer
from severe dermal fibrosis. Interestingly, these animals
die prematurely from pulmonary inflammation and

fibrosis, which is related to increased collagen and
interleukin (IL)-13 production [21]. In contrast to the
skin, fibrosis and inflammation in the lung appears to
be mediated primarily via A2B receptors and, accordingly,
more recent studies demonstrate that adenosine A2B
receptors play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial fibrosis
[22,23]. It is likely that the capacity of A2B receptors
to stimulate IL-6 production [22,42] in the lung can
stimulate fibrosis indirectly.

Hepatic fibrosis
Adenosine, generated in the extracellular space from
0
adenine nucleotides by ecto-5
-nucleotidase, plays a role
in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver [24,25] and, in
the setting of chronic alcoholism, the transition of about
20% of patients to develop hepatic cirrhosis. Recent
studies have demonstrated that adenosine, acting at A2A
receptors, stimulates hepatic stellate cell-mediated fibro-
sis of the liver [26-28] by increasing production of
collagen I and III (the collagens present in scar tissue) via
two distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-
dependent pathways, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK, respectively [29].

Interestingly, caffeine, the most widely used drug in the
world, mediates most of its pharmacologic effects by
nonselectively blocking adenosine receptors, including
A2A receptors, and can prevent hepatic fibrosis in animal
models [25] and, in a case-control study, patients with a
variety of liver ailments [30]. It is, therefore, likely that
the pharmacologic effect of caffeine on hepatic fibrosis
explains the observation made in numerous epidemio-
logic studies in different countries that coffee drinking,
in a dose-dependent fashion, significantly diminishes
death rates due to liver disease [31-40].

Peritoneal fibrosis
A common complication of abdominal surgery or perito-
neal dialysis is peritoneal fibrosis. Although peritoneal
fibrosis is usually of little consequence, in some patients,
peritoneal fibrosis can lead to bowel obstruction or other
problems, so it is encouraging that recent studies in two
different animal models of peritoneal fibrosis demonstrate
that adenosine A2A receptor blockade diminishes perito-
neal fibrosis and adhesions [41].

Cardiac fibrosis
Dubey and colleagues [43] have reported that adenosine
A2B receptor activation inhibits cardiac fibroblast

production of collagen in vitro.
In agreement with
these original findings, Wakeno and colleagues [44]
have reported that adenosine A2B receptor stimulation
diminishes fibrosis and remodeling of the myocardium
after infarction.

Conclusion
Adenosine, a nucleoside that is generated in the extra-
cellular space from adenine nucleotides released at
inflamed and hypoxic sites or as a result of metabolic
stresses in some tissues and organs, stimulates wound
healing, angiogenesis and, in some tissues, under some
circumstances, fibrosis. A number of studies demonstrate
that stimulated adenosine receptors play different roles
in the pathogenesis of fibrosis depending on the tissue.
Adenosine A2B receptors in the heart inhibit fibrosis,
whereas these same receptors promote fibrosis in the
lungs. In contrast, in the skin, liver, and lungs, adenosine
A2A and A2B receptors both mediate an increase in fibrosis.
It is also striking that different adenosine receptors appear
to play a dominant role in fibrosis in different organs;
adenosine A2A receptors are the dominant receptors
in the skin, peritoneum, and liver but A2B receptors are
responsible for pulmonary fibrosis. Adenosine blockade
at these receptors provides novel targets for new therapies
in these difficult clinical settings.
