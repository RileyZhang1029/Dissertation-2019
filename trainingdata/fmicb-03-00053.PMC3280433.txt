(−)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) has useful antiviral, antimicrobial, antitoxin, and
antitumor properties. Previously, Mori et al. (2008) found that addition of long acyl chains
(C16–18) to EGCG enhanced its anti-inﬂuenza virus activity up to 44-fold. The chemical sta-
bility of EGCG against oxidative degradation was also enhanced by acylation. We further
evaluated the in vitro activity spectrum of the EGCG derivatives against a wide range of bac-
teria and fungi. A series of EGCG O-acyl derivatives were synthesized by lipase-catalyzed
transesteriﬁcation. These derivatives exhibited several-fold higher activities than EGCG,
particularly against Gram-positive organisms. Antifungal MICs of the derivatives were also
two to fourfold lower than those of EGCG. The activities of the EGCG derivatives against
Gram-negative bacteria were not distinguishable from those of EGCG. Among the deriv-
atives evaluated, MICs of dioctanoate and palmitate (C16) for 17 Staphylococcus aureus
strains were 4–32 μg/ml, although MIC of EGCG for these 17 strains was ≥128 μg/ml.
C16 demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
ATCC43300 at ≥16 μg/ml. The enhanced activity of C16 against S. aureus was supported
by its increased membrane-permeabilizing activity determined by increased SYTOX Green
uptake. The EGCG derivatives were exported in Escherichia coli using the efﬂux pump
AcrAB–TolC. The tolC deletion mutant exhibited higher sensitivity to EGCG and the deriv-
atives than wild-type. Addition of long alkyl chains to EGCG signiﬁcantly enhanced its
activities against several bacteria and fungi, particularly against S. aureus including MRSA.
C16 might potentially become under speciﬁed circumstances an alternative or supplement
to antibiotics and disinfectants in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Green tea has long been a daily food in Japan with beneﬁcial
health effects. Antibacterial and antitoxin effects of tea (Camellia
sinensis) leaves are already proved in Japan in 1930s (Shima-
mura, 2009). After World War II, anti-inﬂuenza virus activity of
tea extracts was published in 1949 (Green, 1949), and antibac-
terial activity of tea was published in India (Das, 1962). More
than a quarter of a century later, antibacterial activity of tea
was eventually rediscovered in 1989 (Toda et al., 1989). Since
then, recent studies proved that polyphenol components of tea
leaves have antitoxin (Hara et al., 1990; Toda et al., 1990; Hisano
et al., 2003), antiviral (Mukoyama et al., 1991; Nakayama et al.,
1993; Yamaguchi et al., 2002), and antitumor properties (Mukhtar
et al., 1992; Shimamura and Hara, 1997) other than antimicro-
bial activity (Toda et al., 1989; Yam et al., 1997). Tea polyphenols
have broad antibacterial spectrum, and inhibit various kinds of
pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter spp.,
Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157, Helicobacter pylori,
Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma

pneumonia, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella
spp., Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus spp., oral pathogenic
Streptococci (Friedman, 2007). In polyphenols, catechins belong
to the ﬂavan-3-ol class of ﬂavonoids. Catechins are thermo sta-
ble and stable in acidic condition although those are unstable
in neutral and alkali condition. (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate
(EGCG) is the major polyphenolic compound found in green tea
and it has the strongest activity in various useful properties. How-
ever, although antiviral properties of tea polyphenols have been
demonstrated also in vivo (Xiao et al., 2008), EGCG is not so
useful for clinical use because of its poor membrane permeabil-
ity, low chemical stability, and rapid metabolism. Previously, we
synthesized a series of EGCG fatty acid monoester derivatives by
lipase-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation and found that addition of long
acyl chains (C16–18) enhanced the anti-inﬂuenza virus activity of
EGCG up to 44-fold (Mori et al., 2008). Acylation also enhanced
the in vitro antitumor activities of EGCG in an alkyl chain length-
dependent manner (Matsumura et al., 2008). Furthermore, the
chemical stability of EGCG in tissue culture medium was enhanced

10-fold by acylation (Data not shown). But effects of acylation
on antimicrobial and antitoxin activities of EGCG have not yet
been evaluated until now. In this study, we additionally synthesized
unsaturated fatty acid esters and dioctanoyl esters, and evaluated
the in vitro activities of the acylated EGCG derivatives against
a wide range of bacteria and fungi. These derivatives exhibited
increased antimicrobial activities, particularly against Staphylococ-
cus aureus and some fungal species. The antibacterial activity of
palmitate was evaluated in detail. Taken together, these data show
a potential use of EGCG O-acyl derivatives as novel antimicrobial
agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SYNTHESIS OF EGCG O-ACYL DERIVATIVES
A series of EGCG O-acyl derivatives (Figure 1; Table 1) were
synthesized by lipase-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation, according to

a method reported previously (Mori et al., 2008). This method
yielded B-ring-modiﬁed esters as the major products except linole-
nate ester (C18TE). In case of synthesis of saturated fatty acid
monoesters, the ratio of regioisomers was consistent regard-
less of the alkyl chain length. Unsaturated fatty acid esters
and dioctanoyl esters (C8× 2) were also synthesized, and the
ratio of their regioisomers is summarized in Table 1. Mix-
tures of these isomers were used without isolation because
they have similar chemical properties and the antiviral activ-
ities of these mixtures did not vary with their composition
ratio (Mori et al., 2008). Log P values were calculated by a
software; ChemBioDraw Ultra ver. 11 and used as lipophilicity
index (Table 1). Higher log P means higher lipophilicity. The
derivatives were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with distilled
water.

BACTERIAL STRAINS
In total, 17 S. aureus strains [9 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus
(MSSA) and 8 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains].
Five MSSA and seven MRSA strains were clinically iso-
lated from Japan (Table 2). E.
coli MG1655 (wild-type)
and its efﬂux pump gene deletion mutants, ΔacrB, ΔacrD,
ΔacrEF, and ΔtolC constructed by phage P1-mediated trans-
duction (Davis et al., 1980; Nishino et al., 2008) were used
to evaluate the effects of efﬂux pumps on the susceptibil-
to EGCG. Moreover, standard strains of var-
ity of E. coli
species (Tables 3–5) were also
ious bacterial and fungal
analyzed.

ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS AND CHEMICALS
Ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), cefazolin (CFZ), and van-
comycin (VAN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis,
USA). Imipenem (IPM, Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan),
erythromycin (ERY, Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan), teicoplanin
(TEC, Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and nisin (MP Bio-
medicals, LLC, Illkirch, France) were also used. Fluconazole (FLC,
Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used for experiments with fungi.

DETERMINATION OF MICs
MICs were determined by the micro broth dilution method using
Mueller–Hinton broth (Difco, Becton, Dickinson, and Company

Japan, Tokyo, Japan) according to guidelines M07-A8 of the Clini-
cal and Laboratory Standards Institute (2009; CLSI, Wayne, PA,
USA). OD600 was determined using a microplate reader after
overnight incubation. For Figure 2, average and SD of OD600
of four wells for each concentration were calculated. RPMI
1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) buffered with 0.165 M 3-(N -
morpholino) propane sulfonic acid at pH 7.0 was used for fungi.
Effects of peptidoglycan from S. aureus, d-Ala-d-Ala, and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS; all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.)
on the antistaphylococcal activities of C16 were evaluated by
comparison of MIC with or without 30 μg/ml of each bacterial
cell component according to the literature (Zhao et al., 2001).

The combinatorial effects of C16 or EGCG with IPM or
AMP on MRSA were determined by the checkerboard method
(Martinez-Irujo et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2001). The fractional
inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices were calculated as fol-

lows: FIC= [MICA in combination/MICA alone + MICB in combination/
MICB alone]. Synergy was deﬁned as an FIC index of less than 0.5
and addition as an FIC index of 0.5–1.0.

DETERMINATION OF KILLING ACTIVITIES
Killing curves of C16 against MRSA ATCC43300, E. coli MG1655,
and P. aeruginosa PAO1 were plotted and evaluated. Bacterial
suspensions were diluted to approximately 1.0× 105 CFUs/ml

in Mueller–Hinton broth. Bacterial counts were determined at
selected time intervals of 0, 2, 4, and 6 h by enumerating the
colonies formed after plating 10-fold serially diluted specimens
of 100 μl aliquots on two Mueller–Hinton agar plates for each
dilution; the plates were incubated at 37˚C. The average numbers
and SD of two to four plates were calculated.

SYTOX GREEN UPTAKE ASSAY TO DETERMINE MEMBRANE DAMAGE
Exponentially growing cells of MSSA ATCC25923 and MRSA
ATCC43300 harvested in phosphate-buffered saline were used.
SYTOX Green (Lonza Walkersville, Inc., USA) is a high-afﬁnity
nucleic acid stain that can easily penetrate cells with compromised

membranes but not those with intact membranes. Membrane
integrity was determined after exposure to C16, EGCG or nisin
for 15 min by measuring SYTOX Green uptake. Using the plate
reader, ﬂuorescence was determined (Ex/Em: 504/523 nm) after
10 min incubation with SYTOX Green in a black 384-well plate
(Matsumoto et al., 2011). The means and SD values of triple data
were calculated.

RESULTS
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACYL CHAIN LENGTH AND ACTIVITIES OF
EGCG O-ACYL DERIVATIVES AGAINST S. AUREUS
Structures of the EGCG O-acyl derivatives and the ratio of each
acyl component are listed in Figure 1 and Table 1. S. aureus is one
of the most sensitive organisms to tea extract (Toda et al., 1989).
The effect of acyl chain length on antistaphylococcal activity was
evaluated (Figure 2) on the basis of the results of a previous study
on antiviral activities of the acylated EGCG derivatives against
inﬂuenza virus. These antiviral activities were increased in an
acyl chain length-dependent manner (Mori et al., 2008). Growth
inhibitory activities of EGCG for MSSA ATCC25923 and MRSA
ATCC43300 were not increased by C8, but were increased by acyl
chains longer than C12. However, these activities decreased in the
derivatives with an acyl chain length longer than C18. C12 and
C16 showed the strongest activity (MIC; 8 μg/ml) against both
ATCC25923 and ATCC43300 strains. We then synthesized C8× 2,
C16E, C18E, C18DE, and C18TE and evaluated the effect of dia-
cyl as well as unsaturated acyl chains against 17 S. aureus strains
including 8 MRSA strains (Table 2). Although most of these strains
had similar sensitivities to the EGCG derivatives, some MRSA
strains, particularly IPM-resistant strains, exhibited higher MICs.
C8× 2 was similar to C16 and had the strongest activity among
this set of derivatives. In C18 series of derivatives, unsaturation of
fatty acid moieties increased the antimicrobial activity, although
this effect was not evident in C16. The log P values of these deriva-
tives indicated that water solubility improved by the introduction

of an unsaturated bond into C18 (Table 1). Among the deriv-
atives evaluated, MICs of C8× 2 and C16 for all the 17 strains
were ≤32 μg/ml, although MICs of EGCG for these strains were
≥128 μg/ml.

ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES OF C16 AGAINST VARIOUS SPECIES
Antibacterial and antifungal activities of C16 are presented in
Tables 3–5. Table 3 shows MICs for Gram-positive organisms
other than S. aureus. C16 showed several-fold higher activities than
EGCG against these microbial strains except Streptococci, against
which there was less than twofold difference between MICs of both
compounds. C16 exhibited 16-fold superior activities against S.
epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis than EGCG. Suppression of
growth of Gram-negative bacteria was barely detected at the high-
est concentrations of C16 or EGCG (Table 4), making it difﬁcult to
distinguish the differences in their activities based on their MICs.
While Gram-negative bacteria tend to be insensitive to EGCG, C.
jejuni and H. pylori were highly sensitive to EGCG and C16. Neis-
seria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae also exhibited sensitivity
to C16.

Antifungal activity of EGCG and its acyl derivatives were evalu-
ated against various species of Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans,
and Aspergillus fumigatus (Table 5). MICs of the derivatives for
these fungi were two to fourfold superior to those of EGCG. C16E
exhibited the highest activities against these fungi. Introduction
of unsaturated bonds into the acyl chain tended to increase the
antifungal activities of the derivatives.

KILLING ACTIVITIES OF C16
The rapid bactericidal activity of tea extracts against S. aureus are
known through research on the antibacterial activities of cate-
chins (Toda et al., 1989). A time-kill study was conducted against
MRSA ATCC43300, E. coli MG1655, and P. aeruginosa PAO1
(Figure 3). C16 demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against

COMBINATORIAL EFFECTS OF C16 ON ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF
β-LACTAMS IN THE CHECKERBOARD METHOD
The synergistic effects of EGCG with β-lactams have been well
described (Hu et al., 2001, 2002a). C16 and EGCG were evaluated
in combination with IPM or AMP against MRSA strains (Figures 4
and 5). We used two MRSA strains, IPM-sensitive ATCC43300
and IPM-resistant clinical isolate R3. C16 enhanced the activ-
ities of IPM and AMP against both MRSA strains (Figure 4);
the FIC indices were 0.5–1.0. On the other hand, EGCG exhib-
ited negative activity with IPM against IPM-sensitive ATCC43300
(Figure 5A), although synergy between EGCG and IPM (FIC
index < 0.07) against IPM-resistant strain R3 was remarkable
(Figure 5B). EGCG also showed pronounced synergistic activ-
ity with AMP against both MRSA strains (FIC indices <0.188;
Figures 4C,D). In other words, MIC of IPM for R3 was decreased
by 8 μg/ml EGCG from >4 to 0.063 μg/ml, whereas 8 μg/ml of
C16 inhibited the growth of R3 by itself. C16 and EGCG exhib-
ited negative activity with IPM or AMP against MSSA (data not
shown) which was similar to that shown in Figure 5A.

EFFECT OF PEPTIDOGLYCAN ON ANTISTAPHYLOCOCCAL ACTIVITY
OF C16
The bactericidal activity of EGCG against S. aureus was blocked
by the puriﬁed peptidoglycan (Yoda et al., 2004). Effects of pep-
tidoglycan, d-Ala-d-Ala, and LPS, on the activity of C16 against
MSSA ATCC25923 and MRSA ATCC43300 were determined by
changes in MIC caused by the addition of each component to the
medium (Table 6). MICs of C16 for both bacterial strains were
reproducible and doubled in the presence of peptidoglycan as well
as MICs of glycopeptide,VAN, and TEC. However MICs of C16 did
not change with the addition of d-Ala-d-Ala or LPS. In contrast,
MICs of VAN and TEC increased 8- and 32-fold respectively, with
the addition of d-Ala-d-Ala, the target molecule of glycopeptides
in cell walls.

EFFECT OF EFFLUX PUMP DELETION ON ACTIVITIES OF EGCG O-ACYL
DERIVATIVES IN E. COLI
Efﬂux pumps are major resistant factors in Gram-negative bacteria
(Poole et al., 1993; Nikaido, 1998; Li and Nikaido, 2004). E. coli has
several pumps that effect drug resistance (Nishino and Yamaguchi,
2001). Effects of deletion of genes associated with three of these
pumps, AcrAB–TolC, AcrCD–TolC, and AcrEF–TolC were evalu-
ated. AcrAB–TolC is the most powerful pump that is constitutively
expressed in E. coli and has a broad substrate proﬁle (Nishino and
Yamaguchi, 2001). To evaluate the possibility of EGCG and its
derivatives to act as a substrate for efﬂux pumps, MICs of the
EGCG derivatives for efﬂux pump gene deletion mutants of E.
coli MG1655 were determined (Table 7). MICs of all tested deriv-
atives and EGCG for ΔacrB and ΔtolC were lower than those
for the wild-type strain. The acrD or acrEF deletion had almost
no effect on the activities of the EGCG derivatives against E. coli.

MEMBRANE DAMAGE DETERMINED BY SYTOX GREEN UPTAKE ASSAY
The bacterial membrane is considered to be one of
the
most effective targets of catechins (Kajiya et al., 2004). The
membrane-disrupting activities of C16 were compared with those
of EGCG in MSSA ATCC25923 and MRSA ATCC43300 (Figure 6).
Under this condition, a polycyclic antibacterial peptide nisin at
1 μg/ml signiﬁcantly increased SYTOX Green uptake in both
bacterial strains. In a concentration-dependent manner, C16
increased SYTOX Green uptake at ≥8 μg/ml (a half of MIC)
after 15 min incubation with S. aureus cells, while EGCG did not
induce SYTOX Green uptake at 128 μg/ml. EGCG at 64 μg/ml
actually exhibited a protective effect; SYTOX Green uptake was
less than a half of the dye uptake observed with controls. C16 dis-
rupted the membrane of S. aureus more effectively than EGCG,
which supports the previously observed low MIC of C16 for S.
aureus.

DISCUSSION
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most sensitive bacteria to tea
polyphenols. The rapid bactericidal activity of tea extracts against
S. aureus was demonstrated in 1989 (Toda et al., 1989), and the
mechanism underlying the killing activity of catechin by disrupt-
ing the lipid bilayer of the membrane (Ikigai et al., 1993). Subse-
quently, interaction of catechin with lipid bilayers has been studied
in detail (Kumazawa et al., 2004; Uekusa et al., 2007; Kajiya et al.,
2008; Kamihira et al., 2008; Sirk et al., 2008, 2009, 2011; Sun et al.,
2009). Previously, Kajiya et al. synthesized (+)-Catechin deriva-
tives with different alkyl chain lengths and found the antibacterial
activity increased markedly with elongation of the alkyl chain
lengths of the derivatives and reached a maximum at a chain of
four to seven carbons. Lipophilicity and the membrane-disrupting
ability of these derivatives correlate with their antibacterial activ-
ities against Gram-positive organisms (Kajiya et al., 2004). In our
study, addition of acyl chains longer than C12 to EGCG signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced its antibacterial activities particularly against S.
aureus including MRSA. However, the activity of EGCG O-acyl
derivatives decreased in the derivatives with an acyl chain length
longer than C18, so that C12 and C16 had the highest activity
against S. aureus (Figure 2). MICs of C8× 2 for the 17 S. aureus

strains were the lowest and comparable to those of C16 (Table 2).
The increased activities of these derivatives against S. aureus are
probably a result of their enhanced afﬁnity of their long acyl chains
to interact with membranes. In fact, 8 μg/ml of C16 showed sig-
niﬁcant membrane-permeabilizing activity in S. aureus. On the
other hand, EGCG inhibited SYTOX Green uptake to less than a
half of the control at 64 μg/ml (Figure 6). As an explanation of the
opposite effect of 64 μg/ml EGCG in SYTOX Green uptake assay,
peptidoglycan-binding activity of EGCG could be higher than its
afﬁnity to membrane and interfered penetration of SYTOX Green
into Staphylococcal cells. SYTOX Green would be permeabilized
by EGCG in concentrations higher than its MIC. Against inﬂuenza
virus, C16 also exhibited the strongest activity, suggesting an inter-
action with the viral membrane (Mori et al., 2008); however, the
derivatives with acyl chains longer than 16 exhibited decreased
activities probably because of their decreased solubility. The role
of decreased solubility as being a possible reason was deduced from
the higher lipophilicity speculated from the higher log P values in
C18 and C20 (Table 1). Introduction of an unsaturated bond into
the acyl chain tended to reduce lipophilicity and recover the activ-
ity, although it was not very effective in C16 (Table 2). Anyway,
inﬂuenza virus is more sensitive to C16 than S. aureus and E. coli.
The effect of acyl chain length on antistaphylococcal activity of
EGCG was similar but not coincident with that on anti-inﬂuenza
virus activity of it. The difference might come from the different
surface structure of these pathogens such as cell wall in S. aureus
rather than common lipid bilayer. Outer membrane and cell wall
of bacteria might protect lipid bilayer from polyphenols. Acylation
might possible to enhance interaction of EGCG with lipid bilayer
but not break through outer membrane.

(PBP2

Synergistic activities of EGCG with β-lactams against MRSA
have been studied previously (Hu et al., 2001, 2002a). Contem-
porary, EGCG is shown to have no effect on penicillin-binding
protein 2
; protein causative of methicillin-resistance in
(cid:5)
MRSA) mRNA expression or PBP2
production (Zhao et al., 2001).
In combinatorial effects with other cell wall synthesis inhibitors,
EGCG also enhance activity of dl-cycloserine (Zhao et al., 2001),
but antagonizes the activity of VAN and TEC against MRSA
(Hu et al., 2002b). Furthermore, EGCG antagonizes the activ-
ity of polymyxin B against E. coli (Hu et al., 2002b). EGCG
interferes with cell wall integrity by directly binding to pepti-
doglycan, and this might be the major reason for the synergism
between EGCG and β-lactams. EGCG might also bind directly
to glycopeptides and then interfere with their activities (Hu
et al., 2002b). In our results, C16 activity against S. aureus was
decreased with the addition of peptidoglycan, but not of d-Ala-d-
Ala (Table 6), which indicates that C16 binding to peptidoglycan
occurs because of some peptidoglycan structural moieties other
than d-Ala-d-Ala. The peptidoglycan-binding ability of C16 with-
out a d-Ala-d-Ala-mediated mechanism could adversely affect
its antibacterial activity against S. aureus. In fact, 64 μg/ml of
EGCG decreased SYTOX Green uptake in S. aureus (Figure 5),
which indicates a potential protective effect of EGCG on the
surface of bacteria. Binding of EGCG to peptidoglycan might
interfere with binding of glycopeptides to d-Ala-d-Ala residue.
In addition, EGCG inhibits the activity of various β-lactamases
not only from S. aureus but also from Gram-negative bacteria,

including carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzyme, IMP-1 (Zhao et al.,
2002, 2003). However, most cephalosporins and carbapenems
are stable against penicillinase from S. aureus. For this reason,
β-lactamase-inactivating activity of EGCG cannot explain the
mechanism of synergistic activity between EGCG and IPM against
MRSA. When we focus on the action mechanism of β-lactam, there
(cid:5)
are four different cell wall synthesizing enzymes in S. aureus. PBP2
alone might not completely fulﬁll the functions of these other
intrinsic S. aureus PBPs (Zapun et al., 2008). Actually, synergism
between carbapenems and other β-lactams having different PBP
afﬁnities against MRSA has also been reported (Sumita and Mit-
suhashi, 1991). Cell wall synthesis partially affected by β-lactam
would provide an easy access for EGCG to the membrane of
MRSA. In contrast, C16 appears to access the membrane more
easily than EGCG (Figure 6). Therefore, the combinatorial effect
of β-lactam with C16 against MRSA might be weak. In fact, the
combinatorial effects of C16 with AMP and IPM (Figure 3) were
mostly within additive category (FIC indices >0.5), and were not
as strong as those of EGCG with AMP (Figure 5).

Different EGCG susceptibility of Staphylococci and Gram-
negative rods are observed due to the different EGCG afﬁnities
toward various cell wall components (Yoda et al., 2004). EGCG
activity against Enterobacteriaceae was weak and was not strongly
enhanced by acylation (Table 4); however, we did detect higher
activity of the EGCG fatty acid derivatives compared to EGCG
against acrB or tolC deletion mutants of MG1655 (Table 7).
AcrAB–TolC can export various compounds with very different
structures (Nishino and Yamaguchi, 2001). EGCG and its deriva-
tives are now identiﬁed as substrates for AcrAB–TolC. Efﬂux and
low outer membrane permeability could be a strong reason for the
weaker activity of EGCG against Gram-negative bacteria such as
E. coli. In higher concentrations, tea polyphenols can inhibit the
growth of P. aeruginosa by permeabilizing its membrane (Yi et al.,
2010). In this study, 64 μg/ml of C16 inhibited the growth of P.
aeruginosa PAO1, although it was not bactericidal (Figure 3).

Acylation of EGCG enhanced its antimicrobial activity against
various species of bacteria and fungi although it did not expand
antibacterial spectrum (Tables 2–5). C8× 2 and C16 had the
strongest activity against bacteria, particularly against S. aureus
including MRSA. Moreover, C16 is proved to have superior activ-
ity including antivirus (Mori et al., 2008; Kaihatsu et al., 2009)
and antitumor (Matsumura et al., 2008) activities. Although effect
of acylation on antitoxic property of EGCG is not yet evaluated,
beneﬁcial effect would not be expected on that because toxins
are usually not associated with membrane. These ﬁndings are
exciting and further research may support the ﬁnding that the
broad activity of C16 could be invaluable for clinicians as an alter-
native disinfectant as well as an alternative treatment option to
antibiotics, perhaps reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance.
