Abstract
Distinct domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can function as entry points into different protein-
sorting routes. In addition to using the classical ER-Golgi pathway, one of these unconventional routes
utilizes different combinations of machinery of the classical secretory pathway and components of the
autophagosomal system.

Introduction and context
Secretion of membrane proteins and the majority of
soluble proteins involves translocation through or into
the membrane of
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
followed by exportation via coat protein complex II
(COPII)-coated vesicles [1]. In yeast, these vesicles exit the
ER at evenly distributed sites and fuse directly with
dispersed Golgi units. Higher eukaryotes employ the same
core machinery for transport but produce spatially
organized ER exit sites. COPII vesicles and recycling
COPI vesicles form tubular structures that deliver cargo to
a centralized Golgi apparatus. In addition to this well-
conserved function of the ER as an entry point into the
classical secretory pathway, specialized ER domains
may function as entry points into more unconventional
secretion routes. We are at the beginning of a mechanistic
understanding of these alternative transport routes.

Major recent advances
Most metazoan cell types contain cortical ER domains,
which are aligned with the plasma membrane. Ultra-
structural analysis in HeLa cells has revealed the
presence of cortical ER – thin, ribosome-free structures –
and precortical ER [2]. Upon ER calcium depletion, these
cortical ER domains form ER-plasma membrane contacts,
which function in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE).

This signaling process depends on the function of calcium
sensors in the ER lumen: the ER-located type I membrane
proteins STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and
STIM2 [3]. Recruitment of STIMs to membrane contacts
during store depletion involves a dual-targeting mechan-
ism with recognition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate
(PIP) species at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane
[4-6] and interaction with the calcium channel in the
plasma membrane [7,8]. Transient interaction of STIM1
with growing microtubule tips contributes to cortical
localization but this process is not required for SOCE [9].

Recognition of PIPs at the cytosolic face of the plasma
membrane by integral ER membrane proteins is a
conserved mechanism in ER-plasma membrane contact
formation. The accumulation of the polytopic yeast
membrane protein Ist2 at cortical ER depends on a basic
sorting signal that recognizes PI(4,5)P2 [10,11]. A similar
mechanism results in the accumulation of Ist2 at cortical
ER domains in mammalian cells and this leads to a large
extension of this organelle [5,12]. Formation of cortical ER
and accumulation of proteins at cortical ER in mammalian
cells depend on COPI and microtubules [12], suggesting
that coatomer and its interaction with microtubules
play a role in the clustering of proteins in domains of ER
membranes. Further studies are necessary in order to

determine the role of coatomer in the formation of cortical
ER, and it remains an open question whether coatomer
function contributes to the formation of the abundant
cortical ER in yeast as well.

It has recently been proposed that cortical ER domains
may function as entry points into unconventional secre-
tion routes. We have suggested that yeast Ist2 travels
directly from cortical ER to the plasma membrane [13,14],
but it remains to be solved whether Ist2 indeed reaches the
plasma membrane or whether the protein resides com-
pletely in plasma membrane-associated cortical ER. More-
over, this postulated unconventional secretion route is
not conserved. Expression of Ist2 in mammalian cells
leads to the induction of cortical ER [5,12], but it has been
shown that the protein does not reach the cell surface [5].
However, vesicles that bud off from the cortical ER may
bypass the central Golgi in order to reach the neighboring
plasma membrane. Such a pathway may play a role in
neurons, where the ER forms subsurface cisternae in the
soma and extends into dendrites and the axon. This close
association between ER and plasma membrane regulates a
number of neuronal signaling processes [15] and may play
a role in unconventional secretion of locally synthesized
proteins. Dendrites contain Golgi outposts that are
required for dendritic growth [16] but axons lack these
structures. Therefore, in axons, locally translated proteins
may travel directly from ER domains to the plasma
membrane, bypassing Golgi.

A complete bypass of the Golgi has been described for
the secretion of α-integrins in Drosophila during epithelial
cell remodeling [17]. This and other transport routes
depend on Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP).
Deletion of the GRASP homologue GrhA in Dictyostelium
discoideum abolishes unconventional secretion of soluble
acyl-coenzyme A-binding protein (ACBP) [18], and
ACBP-containing vesicles accumulate at the cell cortex
with no docking or fusion with the plasma membrane
[19]. In α-integrin and ACBP secretion, GRASP functions
as a cortical organizer of trafficking routes [17,18,20,21].

ACBP is a highly conserved small (10 kDa) protein that
binds long-chain acyl-CoA esters with very high affinity
and this interaction plays a role in the transport of these
molecules [22,23]. Recent work employing an elegant
bioassay revealed the first mechanistic insights into
unconventional secretion of ACBP [20,21]. The mor-
phological development of slime mold depends on the
secretion and proteolytic processing of small amounts of
the cellular ACBPs [24], and a secreted Acb1 protein
fraction from starved yeast cells was sufficient to induce

encapsulation of D. discoideum [20,21]. This secretion of
ACBPs requires the function of autophagosomes [20,21],
which otherwise mediate the degradation of cytosolic
content in response to environmental changes (e.g.,
starvation). Instead of fusing with the lysosome/vacuole,
the ACBP-containing autophagosomes are re-routed to
the plasma membrane [20,21]. This unconventional
secretion occurs independently of the function of many
steps of the classical secretory pathway [20] but requires
Sec18/NSF, the plasma membrane SNARE Sso1 [20],
fatty acyl-CoA generated by peroxisomes [21], multi-
vesicular bodies (MVBs) and the endosomal compart-
ment but not transport from endosomes to vacuoles
[20]. ACBPs containing autophagosomes may fuse first
with endosomes or MVBs en route to the plasma
membrane [20]. However,
the precise function of
endosomes and MVBs in unconventional secretion of
ACBPs remains an open question.

Future directions
Two exciting questions are how autophagosome-like
vesicles specifically recruit ACBPs and where this branch
of autophagosome formation occurs. Since ACBPs loca-
lize in a ligand-dependent manner to the ER [25], the
loaded long-chain acyl-CoA ester may organize ACBP
loading and autophagosome formation. This is consistent
with the requirement of long-chain acyl-CoA production
for unconventional ACBP secretion [21]. The second
question addresses the source of the donor membrane for
this autophagosome generation. This remains a matter of
debate in the autophagy field [26], but it has been
suggested that mammalian phagosomes originate from
an ER-associated location enriched in PI(3)P [27] and that
PI3-kinase and PI3-phosphatase activities determine
autophagy initiation [28,29]. Electron tomographic ana-
lyses support the idea of a direct connection between
ER and growing phagosomes [30,31]. Specific PIPs at ER
domains in cis and trans may recruit machinery that
allows secretion by different mechanisms. Given the high
degree of conservation between ACBPs in different
species, it is conceivable that human ACBPs use a similar
unconventional route to the extracellular space.
