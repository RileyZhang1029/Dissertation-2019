Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects humans and chimpanzees but not
old world monkeys (OWMs) such as the rhesus monkey (Rh) and cynomolgus monkey
(CM). HIV-1 efﬁciently enters cells of OWMs but encounters a block before reverse tran-
scription. This narrow host range is attributed to a barrier in the host cell. In 2004, the
screening of a Rh cDNA library identiﬁed tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α) as a cellular antiviral
factor. TRIM5α is one of splicing variants produced by TRIM5 gene and TRIM5 proteins
are members of the TRIM family containing RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains. The
RING domain is frequently found in E3 ubiquitin ligase and TRIM5α is degraded via the
ubiquitin–proteasome-dependent pathway. Among TRIM5 splicing variants, TRIM5α alone
has an additional C-terminal PRYSPRY (B30.2) domain. Previous studies have shown that
sequence variation in variable regions of the PRYSPRY domain among different monkey
species affects species-speciﬁc retrovirus infection, while amino acid sequence differences
in the viral capsid protein determine viral sensitivity to restriction. TRIM5α recognizes the
multimerized capsid proteins (viral core) of an incoming virus by its PRYSPRY domain and
is thus believed to control retroviral infection. There are signiﬁcant intraspecies variations
in the Rh-TRIM5 gene. It has also been reported that some Rh and CM individuals have
retrotransposed cyclophilin A open reading frame in the TRIM5 gene, which produces
TRIM5–cyclophilin A fusion protein (TRIMCyp).TRIMCyp, which was originally identiﬁed as
an anti-HIV-1 factor of New World owl monkeys, is an interesting example of the gain of
a new function by retrotransposition. As different TRIM5 genotypes of Rh showed differ-
ent levels of simian immunodeﬁciency virus replication in vivo, the TRIM5 genotyping is
thought to be important in acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome monkey models.

INTRODUCTION
Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a causative
agent of acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS). More
than two million people are infected with HIV-1 annually around
the world. Nevertheless, the host range of HIV-1 is extremely nar-
row, being limited to humans and chimpanzees (Gao et al., 1999).
This narrow host range has hampered the establishment improved
animal models of HIV-1 infection that are needed to facilitate the
development of an efﬁcacious vaccine against HIV-1 infection.
In this review, we summarize current understanding regarding the
species barrier of HIV-1 as discussed from the viewpoint of animal
model development, focusing on tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α), a
restriction factor in monkeys.

LIFE CYCLE OF HIV-1
Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 belongs to the family
Retroviridae, subfamily Lentivirus. It is an enveloped virus with
a single-stranded RNA genome with positive polarity. HIV-1
enters CD4
T cells and macrophages through plasma mem-
brane fusion. The virus RNA genome is subsequently reverse
transcribed by viral-associated reverse transcriptase and resul-
tant double-strand cDNA is transported to the nucleus. In the
nucleus, viral-associated integrase (IN) inserts viral cDNA into the
human chromosome. The transcription is enhanced by cellular

activation and mRNA and full-length viral genome RNA are
exported from the nucleus. Viral proteins assemble beneath the
plasma membrane and virus particles bud from plasma membrane
(Figure 1).

HOST FACTORS REQUIRED FOR HIV-1 REPLICATION IN
HUMAN AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC BARRIER OF HIV-1 IN MICE
Many trials of small animal models for HIV-1 infection have failed
due to lack of host factors in mice, which are necessary for efﬁ-
cient virus replication (Figure 1). CD4, the cellular receptor for
HIV-1, was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a host range barrier because mouse
CD4 does not bind to HIV-1 envelope protein (Landau et al.,
1988). Human CD4 transgenic mice, however, were not suscepti-
ble to HIV-1 infection (Lores et al., 1992). Chemokine receptors
were identiﬁed as entry co-receptors (Alkhatib et al., 1996; Bleul
et al., 1996; Choe et al., 1996; Deng et al., 1996; Doranz et al.,
1996; Dragic et al., 1996; Feng et al., 1996), but mice transgenic
for human CD4 and either human CXCR4 (Sawada et al., 1998)
or CCR5 (Browning et al., 1997) failed to show productive infec-
tion, even though murine CXCR4 is a functional co-receptor for
CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 (Bieniasz et al., 1997).

Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 pre-integration com-
plex (PIC) containing viral cDNA and viral IN are translocated
into the nucleus. Two host cellular proteins have recently been

reported to mediate PIC import. The ﬁrst is a lens epithelium-
derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75; Cherepanov et al., 2003;
Maertens et al., 2003), a protein implicated in the regulation of
gene expression and cellular stress responses. LEDGF interacts
with HIV-1 IN and is thought to guide PIC toward sites of active
transcription for integration of viral cDNA into the human chro-
mosome. The second is Transportin 3 (TNPO3/Transportin-SR2)
identiﬁed by two independent screenings of host factors involved
in HIV-1 replication (Brass et al., 2008; Christ et al., 2008). TNPO3
also binds to IN, but it is also thought to associate with viral cap-
sid (CA) protein and supports nuclear translocation of PICs. It is
currently unclear whether mouse orthologs of either or both of
these factors are defective in nuclear transport and integration of
HIV-1.

(cid:2)

The integrated HIV-1 genome is then transcribed from its pro-
moter in the long terminal repeat (LTR) by using NF-κB and
Sp1 (Jones et al., 1986; Staal et al., 1990; Cullen, 1991). HIV-1
non-structural proteins, Tat, Rev, and Nef, are early gene prod-
ucts produced from multiply spliced mRNAs (Feinberg et al.,
1986). Tat binds to the 5
region of nascent HIV-1 transcripts
and facilitates the elongation of transcribed RNA (Laspia et al.,
1989; Feinberg et al., 1991). Mouse cells do not show Tat-
dependent transcriptional activation of HIV-1. Cyclin T1 (CycT1)
is responsible for this transcriptional barrier in mice (Newstein
et al., 1990; Garber and Jones, 1999). CycT1 protein is a compo-
nent of the CDK9/pTEFb transcription factor complex (Mancebo
et al., 1997; Wei et al., 1998). Human but not mouse CycT1
binds to Tat and activates transcription from HIV-1 LTR (Gar-
ber et al., 1998). Nevertheless, triple-transduction of mouse cells
with human CD4, CXCR4, and CycT1 was insufﬁcient to induce

productive viral infection (Bieniasz and Cullen, 2000). Additional
barriers have been reported in the late stages of the viral life cycle
(Mariani et al., 2000; Keppler et al., 2001; Koito et al., 2003a,b;
Nagai-Fukataki et al., 2011). CRM1, a nuclear export factor that
functions in association with Rev, has been suggested to be one
of the late-phase factors important for the export of unspliced
full-length viral genome from the nucleus (Zheng et al., 2003).
Further studies are necessary to identify host cellular factors that
are necessary for virus replication in humans but defective in
mouse cells in order to establish small animal models of HIV-1
infection.

TRIM5α, ONE OF THE SPECIES-SPECIFIC BARRIERS TO HIV-1
IN MONKEYS
Amino acid sequences of CD4, CXCR4, CCR5, CycT1, and CRM1
in Old World monkeys (OWMs) are almost identical to those of
the human orthologs, while New World monkeys, such as com-
mon marmosets and squirrel monkeys, have less functional CD4
and CCR5 receptors (LaBonte et al., 2002). Nevertheless, HIV-
1 fails to replicate in activated CD4
T lymphocytes obtained
from OWM, such as the rhesus monkey (Rh; Macaca mulatta;
Shibata et al., 1995; Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996) and
cynomolgus monkey (CM; Macaca fascicularis; Akari et al., 1996,
1999). Several studies have suggested that the blockade of HIV-
1 replication in OWM cells occurs at a post-entry step (Shibata
et al., 1995; Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996; Chackerian et al.,
1997) and appears to result from a failure to initiate reverse
transcription (Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996). Importantly,
resistance against HIV-1 infection was shown to be dominant in
heterokaryons between human and OWM cells, suggesting the

presence of inhibitory factor(s) against HIV-1 infection but not
for simian immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV) in OWM cells (Munk
et al., 2002).

In 2004, the screening of an Rh cDNA library identiﬁed
TRIM5α as a factor that confers resistance to HIV-1 infection
(Stremlau et al., 2004; Figures 1 and 2). Both Rh and CM TRIM5α
restrict HIV-1 infection but fail to restrict SIV isolated from a
macaque monkey (SIVmac; Stremlau et al., 2004; Nakayama and
Shioda, 2010). In contrast, human TRIM5α is almost powerless to
restrict the aforementioned viruses, but potently restricts N-tropic
murine leukemia viruses (N-MLV) and equine infectious anemia
virus (EIAV; Hatziioannou et al., 2004; Figure 3).

TRIPARTITE MOTIF OF TRIM5α
TRIM5α is a member of the TRIM family of proteins, and con-
sists of RING, B-box 2, coiled-coil, and PRYSPRY (B30.2) domains
(Reymond et al., 2001; Figure 2). Proteins with the RING domains
possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Jackson et al., 2000); therefore,
TRIM5α was thought to restrict HIV-1 by proteasome-dependent
pathways. However, a proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not rescue
HIV-1 infection from TRIM5α-mediated restriction, even though
the levels of HIV-1 late reverse-transcription products were recov-
ered (Anderson et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006; Maegawa et al.,
2010). TRIM5α is thus thought to use both proteasome-dependent
and -independent pathways to restrict HIV-1. The distinct mol-
ecular mechanism of the proteasome-independent pathway has
yet to be elucidated. It was shown that incubation of an artiﬁ-
cially constructed HIV-1 core structure composed of the capsid–
nucleocapsid (CA–NC) fusion protein with the chimeric protein
containing the Rh-TRIM5α B-box 2, coiled-coil, and PRYSPRY
domains and the RING domain of TRIM21 (TRIM5-21R) caused
apparent breaks in the CA structure without any other cellular
components (Langelier et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2011). It is there-
fore likely that direct binding of Rh-TRIM5α proteins to incoming
HIV-1 CA proteins causes CA disassembly, which is observed as
proteasome-independent restriction.

The intact B-box 2 domain is also required for TRIM5α-
mediated antiviral activity, as TRIM5α restrictive activity is dimin-
ished by several amino acid substitutions in the B-box 2 domain
(Javanbakht et al., 2005). TRIM5α has been shown to form a dimer
(Kar et al., 2008; Langelier et al., 2008), while the B-box 2 domain
mediates higher-order self-association of Rh-TRIM5α oligomers
(Li and Sodroski, 2008; Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009). The coiled-coil
domain of TRIM5α is important for the formation of homo-
oligomers (Mische et al., 2005), and the homo-oligomerization of
TRIM5α is essential for antiviral activity (Javanbakht et al., 2006;
Nakayama et al., 2006).

PRYSPRY DOMAIN OF TRIM5α, A DETERMINANT OF
SPECIES-SPECIFIC RESTRICTION OF VIRUSES
The PRYSPRY domain is speciﬁc for the α-isoform among at
least three splicing variants transcribed from the TRIM5 gene.
Soon after the identiﬁcation of TRIM5α as a restriction factor
of Rh, several studies found that differences in the amino acid
sequences of the variable region 1 (V1) of TRIM5α PRYSPRY
domain of different monkey species affect the species-speciﬁc
restriction of retrovirus infection (Nakayama et al., 2005; Perez-
Caballero et al., 2005; Sawyer et al., 2005; Stremlau et al., 2005;
Yap et al., 2005; Ohkura et al., 2006; Perron et al., 2006; Kono
et al., 2008, 2009). The PPYSPRY domain is thought to rec-
ognize viral cores, as TRIM5α lacking this domain does not
show antiviral activity. Overexpression of truncated TRIM5α lack-
ing the PRYSPRY domain shows a dominant negative effect on
antiviral activity of full-length TRIM5α (Berthoux et al., 2005;
Nakayama et al., 2006). Biochemical studies have shown that
TRIM5α associates with CA in detergent-stripped N-MLV viri-
ons (Sebastian and Luban, 2005) or with an artiﬁcially constituted
HIV-1 core structure composed of the CA–NC fusion protein in
a PRYSPRY domain-dependent manner (Stremlau et al., 2006).
Although the precise three-dimensional crystal structure of the

PRYSPRY domain has not been resolved, TRIM5-21R assembled
and formed two-dimensional paracrystalline hexagonal arrays
in vitro (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011). This assembly required
RING and B-box 2 domains but was independent of the PRYSPRY
domain. However, the hexagonal lattices of HIV-1 CA that mimic
the surface of core act as template for stabilization of TRIM5-
21R arrays in a PRYSPRY-dependent manner (Ganser-Pornillos
et al., 2011). As the interaction between individual CA monomers
and TRIM5α is very weak, CA recognition by TRIM5α is thought
to be a synergistic combination of direct binding interactions
with the PRYSPRY domain, higher-order assembly of TRIM5α,
template-based assembly, and lattice complementarity.

VARIABLE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SIMIAN
IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUSES AMONG MONKEY SPECIES
Simian immunodeﬁciency virus isolated from sooty mangabey
(SIVsm) and SIV isolated from African green monkey (SIVagm)
replicate in their natural hosts (VandeWoude and Apetrei, 2006)
and CD4
human cells. SIVmac evolved from SIVsm in cap-
tive macaques, and replicates efﬁciently in Rh (Shibata et al.,
1995; Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996) and CM (Akari et al.,
1996, 1999) as well as in human CD4
cells but not in African
green monkey (AGM) cells. We found that a 37-amino acid
residue region including a 20-amino acid duplication in the V1 of
AGM TRIM5α determined species-speciﬁc restriction against SIV-
mac239 (Nakayama et al., 2005). However, AGM TRIM5α failed to
restrict SIVagm, which naturally infects AGM, while Rh-TRIM5α
can restrict SIVagm infection (Song et al., 2005b; Figure 3).

+

In contrast to HIV-1, AGM TRIM5α restricted SIVmac239
mainly in a proteasome-dependent manner, as SIVmac239
escaped completely from attacks by RING mutants of TRIM5α
that could still moderately restrict HIV-1 infection. Kim et al.

reported that AGM TRIM5α derived from Chlorocebus tantalus
but not Chlorocebus pygerythrus subspecies of AGM restrict SIV-
mac239, while both potently restrict HIV-1 (Figure 3). Both AGM
TRIM5α share the 20-amino acid duplication but a C. pygery-
thrus-speciﬁc leucine residue at the 34th position within the RING
domain compromised the ability of C. pygerythrus AGM TRIM5α
to restrict SIVmac239 infection (Kim et al., 2011). This result is
consistent with the observation of RING-proteasome dependency
of SIVmac239 restriction by TRIM5α.

Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is assumed to
have originated from SIVsm as a result of zoonotic events involv-
ing monkeys and humans (Hahn et al., 2000). Previous studies
have shown that HIV-2 strains vary widely in their ability to grow
in cells of OWM, such as baboons, Rh, and CM (Castro et al., 1990,
1991; Locher et al., 1998, 2003; Fujita et al., 2003). By testing CM
and Rh recombinant TRIM5α, three amino acid residues of TFP
at the 339th to 341st positions of Rh-TRIM5α V1 were shown to
be indispensable for restricting particular HIV-2 strains that are
still resistant to CM TRIM5α bearing a single Q instead of TFP
at the 339th to 341st positions (Kono et al., 2008; Figure 4). The
TFP motif is also critical to restrict SIVsm (Kirmaier et al., 2010).
Baboon and sooty mangabey (SM) TRIM5α bearing SFP at the
339th to 341st positions can potently restrict HIV-1, only weakly
restrict HIV-2, and failed to restrict SIVmac239 (Newman et al.,
2006; Kono et al., 2008, 2009).

VIRAL DETERMINANT OF SENSITIVITY TO MONKEY TRIM5α
Tripartite motif 5α is thought to recognize viral cores through its
PRYSPRY domain. To determine the region in viral CA that inter-
acts with TRIM5α, we focused on HIV-2, which closely resembles
SIVmac (Hahn et al., 2000). Sequence analysis showed that the
CM TRIM5α-sensitive viruses had proline (P) at the 119th or

respectively.

120th position of CA, while the CM TRIM5α-resistant viruses
had alanine (A), glutamine (Q), or glycine (G) at the same posi-
tion (Figure 4). Replacing the proline of a CM TRIM5α-sensitive
HIV-2 molecular clone with A, Q, or G changed the phenotype
from sensitive to resistant and the mutant viruses replicated well
in the presence of CM TRIM5α. The reverse was observed when
the glutamine of a resistant SIVmac molecular clone was replaced
with proline (Song et al., 2007; Miyamoto et al., 2011). The 119th
or 120th position is located in a loop between α-helices 6 and 7
(L6/7; Figure 5).

In the case of Rh-TRIM5α, Ylinen et al. replaced a loop between
α-helices 4 and 5 (L4/5) of SIVmac239 CA with that of HIV-2 in
the SIVmac239 background and found that the resultant mutant
virus showed impaired growth ability in Rh cells compared with
the parental SIVmac239. However, the reciprocal virus with SIV-
mac239 CA L4/5 in the HIV-2 background did not gain resistance
against Rh-TRIM5α, suggesting that Rh-TRIM5α interacts mainly
with L4/5 but other portion(s) of HIV-2 CA are also involved (Yli-
nen et al., 2005). Lin and Emerman (2008) also reported that
SIVagm with HIV-1 L4/5 and L6/7 was susceptible to Rh-TRIM5α
restriction. In fact, we found that the 120th amino acid of HIV-2
CA, the determinant of CM TRIM5α sensitivity, also contributes to
Rh-TRIM5α susceptibility (Kono et al., 2010). Furthermore, stud-
ies on chimeric viruses between Rh-TRIM5α-sensitive HIV-2 and
Rh-TRIM5α-resistant SIVmac239 revealed that multiple regions
including L4/5 in the N-terminal half of SIVmac239 CA contribute
to evasion of SIVmac239 from Rh-TRIM5α (Kono et al., 2010;
Figure 5).

FIGURE 5 | Structure of the N-terminal half of HIV-2 capsid monomer.
The ribbons represent the backbone of HIV-2 capsid proteins, and seven
α-helices are labeled. The positions important in Rh-TRIM5α recognition are
highlighted as N-termini (the 5th to 13th amino acid residues) in purple, the
loop between α-helices 4 and 5 (L4/5) in green, the 109th T in blue, the
111th E in orange, and the 120th P in red.

To elucidate further details regarding the structure of CA rec-
ognized by TRIM5α, we generated mutant HIV-2 viruses each
carrying 1 of 20 amino acid residues at position 120, and examined
their susceptibilities to CM TRIM5α-mediated restriction. Amino
acid residues with hydrophobic side chains or aromatic rings were
associated with sensitivity to CM TRIM5α, while those with small
side chains or amide groups conferred resistance (Miyamoto et al.,
2011). Computer-assisted three-dimensional models showed that
the mutations at the 120th position in L6/7 affected the confor-
mation of the neighboring loop L4/5 by a hydrogen bond between
aspartic acid 97 in L4/5 and arginine 119 in L6/7 (Figure 6).

Taken together, these observations suggested that TRIM5α rec-
ognized the overall outer surface of the N-terminal half of viral CA
including L4/5 and L6/7. To determine further details regarding
the interaction between CA and TRIM5α, biochemical and struc-
tural analyses of the PRYSPRY domain, especially the V1 loop
bound with CA, are required. In contrast to SIV/HIV-2, the L4/5
loop of HIV-1 also binds cyclophilin A (CypA). It is not yet clear
whether monkey TRIM5α does or does not recognize HIV-1 CA
with endogenous CypA.

INTRASPECIES GENETIC VARIATION OF THE Rh-TRIM5 GENE
The TRIM5 gene varies considerably among primate species
(Sawyer et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005a; Newman et al., 2006).
It is not surprising that the PRYSPRY domain is highly variable
as TRIM5α interacts with the retroviral core through this region,
as described above, and the main pressure for positive selection
may be endogenous retroviruses (Kaiser et al., 2007). Interestingly,
there is a 339TFP341-to-Q polymorphism in Rh-TRIM5α (New-
man et al., 2006; Figure 2), which reduces its anti-HIV-2 activity
(Kono et al., 2008). Newman et al. (2006) grouped Rh-TRIM5α
into six alleles (Mamu-1 to -6) including rare alleles Mamu-2 and
Mamu-6. Wilson et al. (2008a) showed that Mamu-1 and -3 alleles
restrict HIV-1, HIV-2, EIAV, and feline immunodeﬁciency virus
(FIV), but not N-MLV, B-MLV, or SIVmac239, while Mamu-4 and
-5 alleles restrict HIV-1, EIAV, and FIV but not HIV-2, N-MLV,
B-MLV, or SIVmac239 using a TRIM5α-transduced cat cell line
(CRFK).

Lim et al. independently reported 11 Rh-TRIM5α alleles in
which alleles 1–5 contained 339TFP341. Remaining alleles 6–11
contained 339Q. They established B-lymphoblastoid cell lines
(B-LCLs) from Rh and used these B-LCLs for infection with
VSV-G pseudo-typed GFP-expressing viruses. They found more
GFP-positive cells in B-LCLs with Rh-TRIM5α Q allele than in B-
LCLs with Rh TFP allele infected with SIVmac239-, HIV-1-, and
SIVsmE543-based GFP-expressing viruses. It should be noted that
the anti-HIV-1 activity of the Rh-TRIM5α Q allele is signiﬁcantly
stronger than the anti-SIVmac239 and SIVsmE543 activities of
the Rh-TRIM5α TFP allele (Lim et al., 2010b). Lim et al. (2010a,b)
retrospectively analyzed plasma viral load of Rh after SIVmac251
challenge by intravenous route and found that Rh with the Q allele
was associated with higher levels of plasma viral RNA at the time
when the levels of viral RNA stabilized after a period of acute
infection (0.6 log median difference at 70 days after infection),
more rapid loss of central memory CD4
T cells, and higher rate
of progression to AIDS. These results were consistent with their
own in vitro observations described above.

les. Similarly, Kirmaier et al. (2010) detected virtually no anti-
SIVmac239 activity in both Rh-TRIM5α TFP and Q alleles
(Figure 4), although numbers of infected cells in Mamu-4 (Rh-
TRIM5α Q allele) are slightly higher than those in Mamu-1
(Rh-TRIM5α TFP allele). In contrast, Kirmaier et al. (2010)
reported that the Rh-TRIM5α TFP allele restricted SIVsmE543
and SIVsmE041, although the Rh-TRIM5α Q allele did not show
any anti-SIVsmE543 or anti-SIVsmE041 activity. SIVmac239 is
a molecular clone of a highly adapted, emergent virus of Rh,
generated in the 1980s by experimental passage of SIV-positive
plasma through several monkeys (Daniel et al., 1985). In con-
trast, SIVsmE041 is a primary isolate from SM and SIVsmE543
was cloned after experimental passage of SIVsm through two
Rh (Hirsch et al., 1997). SIVmac and SIVsm shared Q at
the 118th position of CA, corresponding to the 120th posi-
tion of GH123 (HIV-2), but SIVmac239 and SIVmac251 have
an R-to-S change at position 97 at the base of L4/5 of CA
that are critical for resistance against Rh-TRIM5α TFP allele
(Figure 4).

In the case of SIVsmE543 in vivo, Rh-TRIM5αTFP/TFP homozy-
gotes markedly diminished viral replication compared to Rh-
TRIM5αQ/Q homozygotes at peak (2 log reduction) and 8 weeks (3
log reduction) after intravenous or intrarectal infection, consistent
with the in vitro results (Kirmaier et al., 2010). It should be noted
that the suppression of SIVsmE543 by Rh-TRIM5α TFP is more
dramatic than that of SIVmac251. In low-dose repeated mucosal
challenge experiments, two groups reported similar results using
SIVsmE660, the CA sequence of which closely resembles that of
SIVsmE543 (Reynolds et al., 2011; Yeh et al., 2011). Several stud-
ies evaluated MHC class I and TRIM5 genotypes in SIV-infected
Rh, and concluded that TRIM5 genotype independently affected

plasma viral load and survival rate after SIV infection (Lim et al.,
2010a; Reynolds et al., 2011; Yeh et al., 2011). Taken together, these
observations indicate that it is necessary to perform TRIM5 geno-
typing of Rh when using SIVsm. It is also better to do so when
using SIVmac239 and SIVmac251, although Fenizia et al. (2011)
recently reported that there was no difference in SIVmac251 sus-
ceptibility among Rh with different TRIM5 genotypes in repeated
rectal challenge.

TRIM5 AND CypA FUSION PROTEIN IN NEW WORLD
MONKEY
Cells of the NWM, owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), are resistant to
HIV-1 infection. Treatment of owl monkey cells with cyclosporin
A, an inhibitor of CypA, allowed HIV-1 infection (Towers et al.,
2003). In 2004, soon after the discovery of TRIM5α, analysis of the
owl monkey TRIM5 gene identiﬁed a long interspersed nuclear
element (LINE)-1-mediated retrotransposition of CypA between
exons 7 and 8, resulting in expression of a fusion protein desig-
nated as TRIMCyp (Nisole et al., 2004; Sayah et al., 2004). Owl
monkey TRIMCyp contained the N-terminal half of TRIM5α,
RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil, but the PRYSPRY domain was
replaced with CypA. As the CypA domain of owl monkey TRIM-
Cyp binds to L4/5 of HIV-1 CA, owl monkey TRIMCyp showed
similar antiviral activity to TRIM5α (Figure 3). The interaction
between HIV-1 CA and CypA can be inhibited by cyclosporine A.
This is a very interesting example of a gain-of-function by retro-
transposition. The owl monkey has been shown to express only
TRIMCyp, and not TRIM5α.

TRIMCyp IN OWMs
The expression of TRIMCyp was thought to be an anomaly unique
to owl monkeys, but in 2008 another CypA insertion was found
in several species of OWMs belonging to the Genus Macaca, Rh,

CM, and the pig-tailed monkey (PM; Macaca nemestrina; Brennan
et al., 2008; Newman et al., 2008; Virgen et al., 2008; Wilson et al.,
2008b). It is reasonable to assume that the retrotransposition event
occurred in the common ancestor of these three macaques. Inser-
tion of the CypA gene was at the 3
end of the TRIM5 gene, which
is different from the owl monkey, indicating that CypA retrotrans-
position into the TRIM5 gene in OWMs occurred independently
from that in owl monkeys. A G-to-T transversion linked with CypA
insertion altering the canonical splicing acceptor of TRIM5 exon
7 caused alternative splicing (Brennan et al., 2008). The resul-
tant mRNA lacks exons 7 and 8, and the PRYSPRY domain is
replaced with CypA. In PM, TRIM5α mRNA is absent. Instead,
TRIM5 isoforms TRIM5θ and TRIM5η were detected. These iso-
forms are splicing variants of the TRIMCyp (Brennan et al., 2008).
TRIM5θ is truncated at the N-terminus of the PRYSPRY domain
and TRIM5η lacks nine amino acid residues encoded by exon 7
(Brennan et al., 2007). PM TRIMCyp restricted HIV-2 but not
HIV-1 infection (Liao et al., 2007; Brennan et al., 2008).

In Rh, the allele frequency of TRIMCyp (Mamu-7 ) was 25%
in an Indian population but TRIMCyp was completely absent
from a Chinese population (Wilson et al., 2008b). Rh TRIMCyp
restricted HIV-2 but not HIV-1 infection (Wilson et al., 2008b).
In CM, Brennan et al. (2008) initially reported that the amino
acid residue at position 357 of CM TRIMCyp, corresponding to
position 54 counting from the methionine of CypA, was arginine
(R), and CM TRIMCyp with R at this position failed to restrict
HIV-1. Subsequently, Ylinen et al. (2010) reported another allele
of CM TRIMCyp encoding histidine (H) at this position (Mafa
TRIMCyp2) and Mafa TRIMCyp2 protein potently restricted HIV-
1 but not HIV-2. Recently, Dietrich et al. (2011) examined 15
CMs from Indonesia, Indochina, Mauritius, and the Philippines
carrying TRIMCyp, and did not ﬁnd R at this position. We also
examined 64 CMs from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indone-
sia carrying TRIMCyp (34 heterozygotes and 30 homozygotes for
TRIMCyp), and found that none of these 94 TRIMCyp genes car-
ried R at this position (Saito et al., 2011a). On the other hand, both
Dietrich et al. and our group found that TRIMCyp frequency in
CM was apparently higher than that in Rh. TRIMCyp frequency
tended to be higher in eastern Asia than in western Asia. Dietrich
et al. and our group also found major and minor haplotypes of
CM TRIMCyp with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CypA
domain. The major haplotype of CM TRIMCyp bears aspartic acid
(D) and lysine (K) at positions 369 and 446, respectively (Bren-
nan et al., 2008; Ylinen et al., 2010). The minor haplotype encodes
asparagine (N) and glutamic acid (E) at positions 369 and 446,
respectively (Dietrich et al., 2011; Saito et al., 2011a). N369 and
E446 were also found in PM and Rh TRIMCyps, and the CypA por-
tion of the NE haplotype of CM TRIMCyp has the same amino
acid sequence as that of Rh TRIMCyp. The major CM haplotype of
the TRIMCyp suppressed HIV-1 but not HIV-2, while the minor
haplotype of TRIMCyp suppressed HIV-2 but not HIV-1 as PM
and Rh TRIMCyp did (Saito et al., 2011a; Figure 4).

The original CypA sequence retrotransposed into the macaque
TRIM5 locus must have been the authentic macaque CypA. There
are two or three amino acid differences between authentic CypA
and the CypA portion of TRIMCyp in Rh, CM, and PM, and

TRIMCyp with the authentic CypA sequence has been shown to
restrict HIV-1 but to only weakly restrict HIV-2 (Virgen et al.,
2008; Price et al., 2009). TRIMCyp from all three of these OWM
species share H at the 372nd position, corresponding to the 69th
position of CypA where the authentic macaque CypA has R. Rh
and PM TRIMCyps and the minor haplotype of CM TRIMCyp
share N at the 369th position (the 66th position in CypA), where
the authentic CypA and major haplotypes of CM TRIMCyp (Mafa
TRIMCyp2) have D. Structural analysis of CypA domain revealed
that these mutations caused drastic changes in conﬁguration of
the active site loop (from the 64th amino acid residue to the 74th
residue in CypA) in Rh TRIMCyp, leading to a decreased bind-
ing afﬁnity to HIV-1 CA but an increased afﬁnity to HIV-2 CA
(Price et al., 2009). Therefore, these mutations enhanced antiviral
activity of TRIMCyp against HIV-2 but diminished anti-HIV-1
activity (Price et al., 2009). In the case of the major haplotype of
CM TRIMCyp, an additional E-to-K change at the 446th position
(the 143rd position in CypA) decreased afﬁnity to HIV-2 CA by its
positive charge (Ylinen et al., 2010), and the D at the 369th position
(the 66th position in CypA) supported its anti-HIV-1 activity.

How did these interspecies and intraspecies variations occur in
TRIMCyp? It is reasonable to assume that the R-to-H mutation
at the 372nd position (R69H) together with the D-to-N mutation
at the 369th position (D66N), which enhanced antiviral activity
of TRIMCyp against HIV-2 but diminished anti-HIV-1 activity
(Price et al., 2009), arose early in a macaque common ancestor.
After the separation of CM from other species, an additional E-to-
K change at the 446th position (E143K) and the N-to-D reversion
at the 369th position (N66D) may also have occurred in the major
haplotype of CM TRIMCyp. Alternatively, polymorphisms at the
369th and 446th positions may have arisen early in a macaque com-
mon ancestor but only CM could transmit these polymorphisms
until the present. As described above, CM TRIM5α has Q at amino
acid position 339 (Nakayama et al., 2005), where Rh-TRIM5α has
a Q-to-TFP polymorphism (Newman et al., 2006; Figure 2). This
Q-to-TFP polymorphism in the PRYSPRY domain also altered
the spectrum of anti-lentiviral activity of TRIM5α (Kono et al.,
2008; Wilson et al., 2008a; Kirmaier et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2010b;
Figure 4). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the selection
pressure in CM drove ampliﬁcation and diversiﬁcation in TRIM-
Cyp, while that in Rh drove diversiﬁcation of the PRYSPRY domain
of TRIM5α. It will be of interest to examine what retroviruses have
driven the evolution of TRIMCyp and TRIM5 genes (Figure 7).

With respect to SIV infection, Rh TRIMCyp failed to restrict
SIVmac239 (Brennan et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2008b; Kirmaier
et al., 2010) but could restrict SIVsm (Kirmaier et al., 2010). The
unique LPA-to-QQ change at positions 89–91 in L4/5 of SIVmac
was critical for escape from Rh TRIMCyp (Figure 4). Rh heterozy-
gous for the TFP allele of TRIM5α and TRIMCyp suppressed viral
infection of both SIVsmE543 (Kirmaier et al., 2010) and SIVsm660
(Reynolds et al., 2011) more efﬁciently than Rh homozygous for
either TRIMCyp or TRIM5α. It is possible that Rh heterozygous
for the TFP allele of TRIM5α and TRIMCyp express two different
molecules that bind distinct regions of CA and eliminate incom-
ing virus more effectively than Rh with TRIM5 molecules targeting
only one region of CA.

OTHER RESTRICTION FACTORS AND DEVELOPMENT OF
MONKEY-TROPIC HIV-1
To establish a monkey model for the study of HIV-1/AIDS,
Kamada et al. (2006) developed an HIV-1 strain with minimal
segments of SIVmac239. This virus (NL-ScaVR and DT5R) con-
tains the L4/5 of CA and the entire vif segment of SIVmac239,
and was designed to escape restriction mediated by ApoB mRNA
editing catalytic subunit (APOBEC) 3G and CypA in OWM cells.
APOBEC3G modiﬁes the minus strand viral DNA during reverse
transcription, resulting in impairment of viral replication (Sheehy
et al., 2002; Harris et al., 2003; Mangeat et al., 2003), but this activ-
ity could be counteracted by the viral Vif protein (Mariani et al.,
2003; Marin et al., 2003; Sheehy et al., 2003). Although HIV-1
Vif can potently suppress human APOBEC3G, it is not effective
against Rh APOBEC3G, which at least partly explains the restric-
tion of HIV-1 replication in monkey cells. CypA binds directly
to L4/5 of HIV-1 CA but not to SIVmac CA and augments HIV-
1 infection in human cells but inhibits its replication in OWM
cells (Kootstra et al., 2003; Berthoux et al., 2004; Nakayama et al.,
+
2008). Although DT5R could replicate in PM primary CD4
T
cells as well as in the CM T cell line HSC-F but not in Rh cells
(Kamada et al., 2006), inoculation of this monkey-tropic HIV-1
(HIV-1mt) into PM did not cause CD4
T cell depletion or any
clinical symptoms (Igarashi et al., 2007), probably due to inefﬁ-
cient viral growth in monkeys. In the case of CM, replacement of
L6/7 of HIV-1 with that of SIVmac239 greatly enhanced viral repli-
cation in PBMC (Kuroishi et al., 2009, 2010) and in animals (Saito
et al., 2011b). However, the virus could not escape completely from
CM TRIM5α (Kuroishi et al., 2010). Another HIV-1mt carrying
202 amino acid residues of SIVmac239 CA and vif, generated by

+

Hatziioannou et al. (2006), could replicate efﬁciently in Rh cells,
conﬁrming that the N-terminal half of CA is required to be that
of SIVmac to escape from Rh-TRIM5α. Unfortunately, this virus
has replaced nearly all of CA sequence with that of SIVmac239
and has lost important CTL epitopes of HIV-1, and thus further
improvement is required to use Rh as an HIV-1 infection model.
H87Q and/or V86M mutations induced by adaptation of HIV-1
to the cells expressing Rh-TRIM5α (Pacheco et al., 2010) would
be useful. In contrast, lack of functional TRIM5α expression in
PM enabled Hatziioannou et al. (2009) to construct an HIV-1mt
strain that differs from HIV-1 only in the vif gene and can efﬁ-
ciently replicate in PM. This is the most promising HIV-1/monkey
model at present, if PMs are available in sufﬁcient numbers for
research.

Other host factors capable of suppressing HIV-1 replication
were recently identiﬁed (Figure 1). One is tetherin (also know
as BST2 or CD317; Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008).
BST2 is an interferon-inducible membrane protein that interferes
with the detachment of virus particles from infected cells. HIV-
1 overcomes this restriction by expressing an accessory protein,
Vpu, which counteracts BST2. BST2 restriction is also counter-
acted by primate lentiviruses that do not express a Vpu pro-
tein. Anti-BST2 functions are provided by the Env protein in
HIV-2 and SIVtan (Gupta et al., 2009) or the Nef protein in
SIVsm/mac and SIVagm (Jia et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009).
As chimeric virus containing the tat, rev, vpu, and env of the
HXB2 strain of HIV-1 in the genetic background of SIVmac239
is pathogenic in Rh and PM (Joag et al., 1996), BST2 in mon-
keys can be canceled by HIV-1 Vpu. Another recently identiﬁed
host factor is SAMHD1 as dendritic and myeloid-cell-speciﬁc
