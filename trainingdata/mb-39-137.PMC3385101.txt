A  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coignetiae  red  wine  was  vinified  by  fermentation  of  a  mixture  of  a  Vitis  hybrid–Vitis  coignetiae  must
with  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904  at  25oC  for  10  days.  The  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coignetiae  red  wine  showed  high  anti-
hypertensive  angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitory  activity  (67.8%)  and  antioxidant  activity  (76.7%).  The  anti-
hypertensive  ACE  inhibitor  in  the  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coignetiae  red  wine  was  partially  purified  by  solid  phase  extraction
chromatography,  and  its  ACE  inhibitory  activity  yielded  an  IC50  of  1.8 mg/mL.  Six  kinds  of  oligopeptides,  including  five  new
kinds,  were  contained  in  the  partially  purified  ACE  inhibitor  fraction  from  the  red  wine  after  10  days  of  fermentation.  Anti-
oxidant  activity  decreased  significantly  from  76.7%  to  40.5%  when  the  post-fermentation  period  was  prolonged  to  30  days.

Many  studies  have  reported  the  health  benefits  of  red
wine [1-6]; however, only a few have investigated the car-
diovascular  and  anti-dementia  functionalities  of  red  wines
[7].  In  a  previous  study  [8],  the  effect  of  Vitis  coignetiae
on  the  quality  and  anti-hypertensive  effects  of  a  new  Vitis
hybrid  (Sheridan)  red  wine  were  investigated.  In  this
study,  the  angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibi-
tory  and  antioxidant  activities  of  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coigne-
tiae red wine were investigated.

V.  coignetiae  (Wild  grape)  and  Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)
grapes harvested in 2010 were purchased from a commer-
cial  market.  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904  from
the  Laboratory  of  Food  Biotechnology  at  Paichai  Univer-
sity  (Daejeon,  Korea)  was  used  for  preparing  the  red
wines.  The  ACE  used  in  this  study  was  extracted  over-
night  from  rabbit  lung  acetone  powder  (Sigma  Chemical
Co.,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA)  using  100 mM  sodium  borate
buffer  (pH  8.3)  containing  300 mM  NaCl  at  4oC.  Hippu-
ric  acid-histidine-leucine  and  DPPH  were  also  purchased
from Sigma Chemical. Unless otherwise specified, all chemi-
cals were of analytical grade.

The  Vitis  hybrid  grapes  were  crushed,  filtered  to  prepare
juice,  and  then  supplemented  with  V.  coignetiae  (10%,  w/v).
The  mixture  was  again  crushed  and  adjusted  to  24o  brix
by  adding  sugar.  After  adding  150 ppm  K2S2O5, the  mix-
ture was left to settle for 5 hr and then inoculated with 1%

S.  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904,  which  had  been  incubated  in
must for 24 hr. The complex musts were fermented for 10
days at 25oC and filtered [9].

ACE inhibitory activity was assayed according to a mod-
ified  method  of  Cushman  and  Cheung  [10].  A  mixture
containing  100 mM  sodium  borate  buffer  (pH  8.3),  300 mM
NaCl, 3 units ACE, and 50 µL sample (1 mg of the freeze-
dried  extracts  was  dissolved  in  50 µL  of  100 mM  sodium
borate  buffer,  pH  8.3)  was  preincubated  for  10 min  at
37oC.  The  reaction  was  initiated  by  adding  50 µL  hippu-
ric-histidine-leucine  at  a  final  concentration  of  5 mM  and
terminated  after  30 min  of  incubation  by  adding  250 mL
1.0 N HCl. The hippuric acid liberated was extracted with
1 mL  of  ethyl  acetate,  and  0.8 mL  of  the  extract  was
evaporated  to  dryness  using  a  Speed  Vac  Concentrator
(EYELA,  Tokyo,  Japan).  The  residue  was  then  dissolved
in  1 mL  sodium  borate  buffer,  and  the  absorbance  was
measured  at  228 nm  to  estimate  ACE  inhibitory  activity
using the following equation:

Inhibition activity (%) = [1 − (A − B)/(C − D)] × 100

where  A  is  the  absorbance  of  the  solution  containing  the
ACE,  substrate,  and  sample;  B  is  the  absorbance  of  the
solution  containing  ACE  and  the  sample  without  the  sub-
strate; C is the absorbance of the solution containing ACE
and  the  substrate  without  the  sample;  and  D  is  the  absor-

bance of the solution containing only the substrate.

Fibrinolytic  activity  was  assayed  as  follows  [11].  We
added  0.5 mL  of  each  sample  to  3 mL  of  the  substrate
solution (0.6% fibrin in 0.1 M McIlvaine’s buffer, pH 7.0)
and  incubated  them  at  40oC  for  10 min.  The  reaction  was
stopped  by  adding  3 mL  0.4 M  trichloriacetic  acid  for
30 min  and  the  mixture  was filtered with  Whatman  No.  2
filter paper (Whatman International Ltd., Clifton, NJ, USA).
We  then  placed  a  reaction  mixture  of  1 mL  of  filtrates,
5 mL 0.4 M Na2CO3, and 1 mL 1 N Folin reagent at room
temperature  for  30 min.  The  amount  of  tyrosine  released
from  the  fibrin  was  determined  from  a  tyrosine  standard
curve based on  absorbance  measurements at 660 nm.  One
unit  of  activity  was  defined  as  the  production  of  1 µg  of
tyrosine per minute for a 1 mL sample.

3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA  (HMG-CoA)  reduc-
tase  inhibitory  activity  was  assayed  spectrophotometri-
cally  by  measuring  the  rate  of  decrease  in  absorbance  at
340 nm  due  to  the  oxidation  of  NADPH  [11].  A  0.5 mL
volume  of  the  reaction  mixture  contained  the  following:
50 µM  potassium  phosphate  buffer,  pH  7.0,  2 µM  dithio-
threitol, 0.3 µM NADPH, 0.15 µM HMG-CoA, and 100 µg
of  protein  (enzyme).  Two  reaction  mixture  aliquots  were
preincubated  in  2 mm  light-path  glass  cuvettes  for  5 min
at  37oC.  For  the  assay,  we  added  HMG-CoA  to  one  reac-
tion mixture aliquots and added HMG-CoA with each red
wine extract to the other reaction mixture aliquot. The ali-
quots were assayed at 37oC in a recording spectrophotom-
eter. The initial velocity of the reaction was measured, and
the net rate of NADPH oxidation was determined by sub-
tracting the rate of oxidation in the absence of HMG-CoA
from the rate observed when both substrates were present.
Thus,  we  calculated  the  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitory
activity as follows:

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity (%)

= [1 − (A340 of sample − A340 sample of blank)
/(A340 of control − A340 control of blank)] × 100

Antioxidant activity was assayed as follows using DPPH
[11].  A  0.8 mL  DPPH  solution  (12.5 mg  DPPH  dissolved
in 100 mL ethanol) was added to 0.2 mL of sample, shaken
for  10 sec,  and  left  for  10 min.  We  then  determined  the
absorbance at 525 nm. The antioxidant activity was calcu-
lated  as:  [1 − (absorbance  of  reaction  mixture − absorbance
of sample alone)/absorbance of blank] × 100.

The  ACE  inhibitor  contained  in  the  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis
coignetiae  red  wine  was  partially  purified  by  solid  phase

extraction  chromatography  as  follows.  Fifty  mL  of  con-
centrated  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coignetiae  red  wine  was  applied
to  a  C18  solid  phase  extraction  (Sep-Pak  C18  Cartridge;
Waters  Co.,  Milford,  MA,  USA),  and  the  peptides  in  the
active  fraction  were  analyzed  by  liquid  chromatography-
mass  spectrometry  (MS).  The  active  fractions  were  sepa-
rated  by 12% SDS-PAGE and in-gel digested, as described
previously [12]. The digests were resolved in 15 mL 0.02%
formic  acid  in  0.5%  acetic  acid.  The  peptide  samples
(10 mL)  were  concentrated  on  an  MGU30-C18  trapping
column (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA, USA) and sub-
jected  to  a  nanocolumn  (10 cm,  75 µm  i.d.,  C18  reverse-
phase  column,  Proxeon  Biosystems,  Staermosegaardsvej,
Denmark) at a flow rate of 120 nL/min. Subsequently, the
peptides  were  eluted  from  the  column  by  applying  a  gra-
dient  of  0~65%  acetonitrile  for  80 min  at  the  same  flow
rate.  All  MS  and  MS/MS  spectra  were  acquired  in  data-
dependent  mode  using  a  LCQ-Deca  ESI  ion  trap  mass
spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan Co., San Jose, CA, USA).
The MS/MS spectra  were identified using  SEQUEST ver.
3.3 software (Thermo Finnigan Co.).

Functional  properties  of  Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)-V.  coi-
gnetiae  red  wine. After  10  days  of  fermentation,  the
Vitis  hybrid-V.  coignetiae  red  wine  yielded  an  ethanol  con-
tent  of  13.5%  and  67.8%  antihypertensive  ACE  inhibitory
activity  (Table  1).  Furthermore,  the  antioxidant  activity  was
76.7%,  but  no  or  very  low  levels  of  fibrinolytic  and  HMG-
CoA  reductase  inhibitory  activity  were  detected.

ACE  inhibitory  peptides  and  antioxidant  activity. After
the partial purification of the ACE inhibitor from the Vitis
hybrid-V.  coignetiae  red  wine  by  systematic  solvent  extrac-
tion  and  solid  phase  extraction  chromatography,  an  active
fraction with an IC50 of 1.8 mg/mL was obtained. Six kinds
of  oligopeptides,  including  five  new  kinds,  were  contained
in  the  red  wine  after  a  10  day  fermentation  (Table  2).
Therefore,  we  chemically  synthesized  these  oligopeptides,
and  we  plan  to  identify  the  antihypertensive  ACE  inhibi-
tory  peptides  after  determining  their  ACE  inhibitory  activity.
Recently,  various  ACE  inhibitors  with  antihypertensive
effects  [13]  have  been  isolated  from  Korean  traditional
alcoholic  beverages [12]  and sake and its  by-products [9].
Almost  all  ACE  inhibitors  are  peptides  or  a  complex  of
glycoprotein  and  polyphenol  [14],  except  for  triterpene
[11]. Many different sequences of ACE inhibitors have been
reported, ranging from tripeptides to oligopeptides [9].

Although  the  peptide  sequences  of  the  ACE  inhibitor
from  this  red  wine  were  longer  and  thus  were  degraded
more  easily  in  the  stomach  by  some  proteases  and  more
difficult to absorb in the intestine, this is the first report of
unique  antihypertensive  ACE  inhibitory  oligopeptides  in
red  wine.  In  a  previous  study  [8],  we  demonstrated  the
antihypertensive action  of a  partially purified  ACE inhibi-
tor using the spontaneous hypertensive rat.

The  antioxidant  activity  of  the  Vitis  hybrid-V.  coignetiae
red  wine  decreased  significantly  from  76.7%  to  40.5%
during  a  30  day  post-fermentation  period  and  remained
unchanged  thereafter  (data  not  shown),  although  its  ACE
inhibitory  activity  increased  about  12%  during  a  60  day
post-fermentation period in a previous study [8].
