Cereals-derived foods represent a key constituent in the diet of many populations. In
particular, pasta is consumed in large quantities throughout the world in reason of its
nutritive importance, containing signiﬁcant amounts of complex carbohydrates, proteins,
B-vitamins, and iron. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that
play a key role in the production of fermented foods and beverages with high relevance for
human and animal health. A wide literature testiﬁes the multifaceted importance of LAB
biotechnological applications in cereal-based products. Several studies focused on LAB
isolation and characterization in durum wheat environment, in some cases with prelimi-
nary experimental applications of LAB in pasta-making. In this paper, using sourdough as
a model, we focus on the relevant state-of-art to introduce a LAB-based biotechnological
step in industrial pasta-making, a potential world driver of innovation that might represent
a cutting-edge advancement in pasta production.

INTRODUCTION
Wheat-derived foods (e.g., pasta, bread, noodles) represent key
constituents in the diet of many populations. In particular, pasta
is largely consumed throughout the world in reason of its gas-
tronomic and nutritive importance (Antognelli, 1980), as it con-
tains signiﬁcant amounts of complex carbohydrates, proteins,
B-vitamins, and iron. In 2010, about 12.8 million tonnes of
pasta have been produced worldwide. The world pasta produc-
tion is dominated by the European Union and American coun-
tries, even if states like Egypt, Turkey, Japan, and India are also
considered important producers (http://www.pasta.unfpa.org). In
Europe and North America, the raw material for pasta products
is generally durum wheat. The use of durum semolina leads to
higher rheological properties of the dough, as well as greater
color and cooking quality of the product (Troccoli et al., 2000).
However, it is possible to employ non-durum wheat ingredients
to produce speciﬁcally blended pasta (Fuad and Prabhasankar,
2010). Conventional pasta can be enriched, supplemented, or for-
tiﬁed. In recent years, several ingredients and additives have been
designed to enhance the quality of pasta, by improving nutritional
parameters, palatability, and overall product quality (Fuad and
Prabhasankar, 2010). According to de Noni and Pagani (2010),
the more advanced innovations in pasta manufacturing have been
focused on optimizing the drying process. Conversely, less atten-
tion has been paid to evaluating the consequences of the drying
process: heat damaged molecules and pasta constituents can affect
the sensorial and the nutritional quality of the ﬁnished product.
With this concern, the authors (de Noni and Pagani, 2010) under-
lined the importance of promising biotechnological innovations

to solve this critical issue in pasta quality. With this goal and with
a more general aim, even if it is well known that pasta products do
not require any microbial bio-process to achieve the ﬁnal product,
we highlight the impact of the potential biotechnological applica-
tions of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in pasta-making process. LAB
constitute a heterogeneous group of bacteria that play a key role
in the production of fermented foods and beverages, with high
relevance for human and animal health. A wide literature testi-
ﬁes the multifaceted existing importance of LAB biotechnological
applications in cereal-based products (Salminen et al., 2004). Sev-
eral studies have focused on LAB isolation and characterization
in durum wheat environment, in some cases with experimental
applications of LAB in pasta-making (Corsetti et al., 2001, 2007;
di Cagno et al., 2005; Ricciardi et al., 2005; Valerio et al., 2009; De
Angelis et al., 2010; Russo et al., 2010; Capozzi et al., 2011).

This review will brieﬂy describe the existing, available knowl-
edge to introduce a LAB-based biotechnological step as a driver of
innovation in pasta production. Naturally, the aim of this paper
is not to be exhaustive of all the possible applications, but to
clearly illustrate the principal determinants and insights involved.
In particular, the proposed biotechnological applications open
new opportunities in enhancing functional and nutritional pasta
quality, and texture of gluten-free pasta products.

Lactic acid bacteria and pasta production

as the closest ecological and technological environmental model.
Sourdough, essentially a mixture of cereal ﬂour and water, is
reported to be a metabolically active dough featuring a hetero-
geneous microﬂora, mainly represented by LAB and yeasts (Vogel
et al., 1999; De Vuyst and Neysens, 2005; Corsetti and Settanni,
2007; De Vuyst and Vancanneyt, 2007; De Vuyst et al., 2009).

In regards to the microecology of durum wheat sourdough,
Corsetti et al. (2001) analyzed 25 durum wheat sourdoughs from
the South of Italy (Apulia) and identiﬁed a bacterial popula-
tion composed by 30% of L. sanfranciscensis, 20% Lactobacillus
alimentarius, 14% L. brevis, 12% Leuconostoc citreum, 7% L. plan-
tarum, 6% Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% L. fermentum and
Lactobacillus acidophilus, 2% Weissella confusa, and 1% Lactobacil-
lus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (Corsetti et al., 2001). Ricciardi
et al. (2005), in the durum wheat sourdough used for preparation
of Altamura bread, found 88% of facultatively heterofermen-
tative LAB (L. plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus
casei) and 12% of heterofermentative LAB (L. brevis, Leuconostoc
mesenteroides).

THE METABOLIC ARENA
Studies by Gobbetti et al. (2005), Gänzle et al. (2007), and De
Vuyst et al. (2009) provide excellent overviews on the metabolism
of sourdough LAB. Several reports underline the strong connec-
tion between the microbial diversity of the sourdough ecosystems
and the end-product metabolites (De Vuyst and Neysens, 2005;
Corsetti and Settanni, 2007; De Vuyst and Vancanneyt, 2007;
Paramithiotis et al., 2007; Scheirlinck et al., 2007; Van der Meulen
et al., 2007; De Vuyst et al., 2009; Zhang and Gänzle, 2010; Ravyts
and De Vuyst, 2011).

With respect to carbohydrate metabolism, LAB can be divided
into three groups: obligate homofermenters, obligate heterofer-
menters, and facultative heterofermenters. Homofermentation of
hexoses procedes via the Emden–Meyerhoff pathway, with the
ﬁnal conversion of pyruvate into lactate. Heterofermenters obtain
energy to grow from the catabolism of sugar via the pentose phos-
phate pathway, producing lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and CO2.
Facultative heterofermenters degrade hexose like homofermenters,
but possess an inducible phosphoketolase and thus are able to
ferment pentose to lactic acid and acetic acid.

Almost all LAB have numerous (4 up to 14 amino acids)
auxotrophies, consequently LAB depend on the degradation of
proteins (Gobbetti et al., 2005). The proteolytic system acts at dif-
ferent levels by means of (i) extracellular proteinase, (ii) speciﬁc
transport systems for di/tri-peptides and oligopeptides, and (iii)
intracellular peptidases (Gobbetti et al., 2005).

Besides carbohydrate and peptide utilization, sourdough LAB
possess numerous metabolic activities of interest during sour-
dough fermentation (Corsetti and Settanni, 2007).

LAB BIOTECHNOLOGICAL POTENTIAL IN PASTA-MAKING
PROCESS COMPATIBILITY
A primary issue to assess the potential industrial exploitation is
to deﬁne a LAB employ in pasta manufacturing which is coher-
ent with the required ﬁnal quality of pasta products. According to
Bevilacqua et al. (2007), we brieﬂy overview the principal stages
of pasta production. Most pasta is manufactured by continuous,

high capacity extruders, in which kneading and extrusion are per-
formed as a single operation. As said in the introductory section,
pasta manufacturers prefer semolina as principal raw material,
which consists of ﬁne particles of uniform size and produces the
highest quality pasta product. The water used should meet the
requirements for drinking water. The durum wheat is subjected to
grinding phase, resulting in semolina and sub-products. Semolina
is used for pasta, while sub-products are utilized for cattle feed. The
industrial production begins with the dosing phase: about 0.3 kg
of water is added for each kilogram of semolina, up to a ﬁnal
humidity content of about 35%, and the mixture is centrifuged at
an average speed of 8,000 rpm. In the subsequent kneading phase,
several paddle wheels knead the mixture in a series of W-shaped
basins. The obtained dough is transferred to the extruder. In the
drawing phase, the mixture is pressed and wiredrawn under a pres-
sure with values ranging from 4 to 10 bar. The drying phase, the
most difﬁcult and critical step to control, consists of a ﬂow of hot
air at a maximum temperature of 80˚C that heats the pasta, thus
reducing progressively its humidity from a 30 to a 12.5% value.

To the best of our knowledge, in literature there are two main
approaches proposed for the potential application of LAB in pasta
manufacture (di Cagno et al., 2005; Capozzi et al., 2011). di Cagno
et al. (2005) performed a fermentation of durum wheat semolina
with selected lactobacilli to produce pasta with the goal to poten-
tially decrease gluten intolerance. A pool of selected LAB was used
to ferment durum wheat semolina under liquid conditions, the
ﬁnal product was freeze-dried, mixed with buckwheat ﬂour at a
ratio of 3:7, and used to produce pasta product. This approach
allows a real sourdough-like phase, with the advantages of a com-
plete use of LAB potentialities. However, the freezing-dry process
probably leads to a substantial increase of pasta production costs.
Recently, a selected mix of LAB was used to produce vitamin B2-
enriched pasta (Capozzi et al., 2011). In particular, two selected
spontaneous riboﬂavin-overproducing variants of L. plantarum
were added up to 107 CFU/g. The pre-fermentation step at 30˚C
was performed at two water content levels (42 and 60% for 16 h).
After the pre-fermentation step, the remaining semolina fraction
was added to perform a classical pasta-making procedure. This
approach introduces a novel and direct exploitation of LAB with
biotechnological potential in pasta-making.

The big effort remains to couple sourdough technology with
pasta-making technology in a new innovative application: a LAB-
based biotechnological step in pasta production. A critical ques-
tion is represented by the end-products of microbial carbohydrate
catabolism. In the case of heterofermentative LAB, the massive
production of CO2 may lead to production of bubbles in the food
matrix. Effectively, in most modern pasta plants the last W-shaped
basin works under vacuum conditions, so to remove air bubbles
from the dough before extruding. This device probably will help
to overcome the problem of small bubbles produced by LAB that
might diminish the mechanical strength and give the ﬁnished
product a white and chalky appearance. However, in our opin-
ion, homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative bacte-
ria remain the best candidates for starter formulation. Other dis-
advantages might be connected to the changes introduced by LAB
biochemisms (e.g., acidiﬁcation activity) and to the consequent
impact on pasta technological quality. With this regard, Capozzi

Capozzi et al.

Lactic acid bacteria and pasta production

et al. (2011) did not detect any change in pasta cooking qual-
ity when L. plantarum were used in the pasta-making procedure.
However, in reason of the numerous strain-dependent characteris-
tics, it is strongly suggested to assess pasta quality in reason of the
microbial resources employed. Obviously, this biotechnological
step requires additional time and costs in the production process,
thus each application requires a tailored cost–beneﬁt analysis.

Concerning microbial dynamics, Russo et al. (2010) studied
the dominant LAB directly during a pasta manufacturing process.
The majority of strains were identiﬁed as belonging to Pediococ-
cus pentosaceus and Enterococcus faecium species. The remaining
strains were characterized and assigned to Weissella confusa, Pedio-
coccus acidilactici, L. mesenteroides, L. citreum, L. fermentum, and
L. plantarum species. During the technological steps, an increase
of LAB population was observed from kneading to extrusion, fol-
lowed by a continuous decrease, probably in reason of the raising
temperature encountered in extrusion and pre-heating.

A microbial diversity is evident comparing semolina sourdough
(Corsetti et al., 2001; Ricciardi et al., 2005; see Ecological Factors
and Biodiversity) and semolina processed in pasta-making (Russo
et al., 2010). Whereas it appears difﬁcult to address all the changes
to process conditions, in fact it is important to consider also the
original microbiota in the semolina, the diverse polarity in dom-
inant population clearly indicates the signiﬁcance to consider the
different environmental determinants during pasta-making with
respect to a general sourdough model. This underlines the impor-
tance to calibrate the potential biotechnological impact of speciﬁc
LAB biotypes and to consider the dominance of starter cultures for
these particular applications. Probably the abiotic stressors typical
of pasta-making (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure) have a role
in shaping the microbial population during the process.

Besides, from a metabolic perspective, it is crucial to remark
that differences exist in the macronutrient composition of com-
mon wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (Triticum
durum Desf.), and that it will be interesting to assess how these
differences inﬂuence LAB sourdough metabolism.

QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
In the food sector, LAB-driven fermentations are performed to
obtain safe and shelf stable food products with distinctive ﬂa-
vor and texture. Several metabolic traits of LAB may signiﬁcantly
contribute to cereal-based products quality: antimicrobial activ-
ity, acidiﬁcation and modiﬁcation of the redox potential, forma-
tion of polysaccharides and oligopolysaccharides, and glutamine
and glutamate metabolism (Gänzle, 2009). In addition, it is not
secondary to consider the LAB inﬂuence on organoleptic prop-
erties (for instance volume, crumb texture, and a unique ﬂavor).
Although pasta is generally not considered for its aromatic prop-
erties, Beleggia et al. (2009) analyzed the chemical and volatile
composition of semolina and pasta samples produced from four
durum wheat cultivars, identifying 35 volatile compounds includ-
ing aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, terpenes, esters, hydrocarbons,
and a furan. These ﬁndings prove that semolina potentially releases
volatile compounds that might affect the aroma of the pasta
products. In particular, the authors observed quantitative and
qualitative volatile compounds differences between semolina and
pasta samples. During cooking, an increase in aldehyde content,

the appearance of ketones, and a decrease in alcohol content were
found (Beleggia et al., 2009). Recently, Beleggia et al. (2011) inves-
tigated the metabolite variations during industrial pasta process-
ing (from semolina to dried pasta) for ﬁve different commercial
products, evidencing that a number of metabolites undergo a
transformation during pasta-making, depending on the process-
ing conditions adopted. di Cagno et al. (2005) evaluated sensorial
quality of pasta produced with a LAB-based biotechnological step:
they did not found difference in odor and ﬂavor, while slightly
decreased stickiness and ﬁrmness were detected.

NUTRITIONAL QUALITY, MICRONUTRIENTS, AND LAB CELL FACTORIES
Fermentation can modify cereal matrix in a number of ways poten-
tially increasing nutritional quality of the ﬁnal products (Poutanen
et al., 2009). The production of organic acids is responsible for
a lower degree of starch gelatinization which would probably
explain diminished starch digestibility, which leads to low glycemic
responses (Poutanen et al., 2009). LAB may be employed to remove
selected undesirable sugars or to produce numerous low-calorie
sugars and oligosaccharides (Hugenholtz et al., 2002). In addition,
the changes introduced by fermentation selectively inﬂuence the
activity of certain enzymes, such as amylases, proteases, hemicel-
lulases, and phytases (Poutanen et al., 2009). In particular, LAB
phytases catalyze phytic acid hydrolysis (Lopez et al., 2000; De
Angelis et al., 2003). Phytic acid has a negative impact on the
bioavailability of divalent and trivalent mineral ions (Lopez et al.,
2000; De Angelis et al., 2003). Additionally, the production of lac-
tic acid by LAB and the consequent pH decrease improve mineral
bioavailability (Poutanen et al., 2009). The concept of in situ for-
tiﬁcation by bacterial fermentation provides the basis to enhance
the nutritional value of food products and their commercial value.
In recent years, a number of biotechnological processes have been
explored to perform a more economical and sustainable vitamin
production than that obtained via chemical synthesis (Burgess
et al., 2009). By this approach, we developed a convenient, efﬁ-
cient and food-grade biotechnological strategy for the production
of vitamin B2-enriched bread and pasta (Capozzi et al., 2011).
The increasing number of sequenced LAB genomes (Klaenham-
mer et al., 2002) is changing our vision on the use of metabolic
models for improving food fermentation and LAB cell factories
performance in food industries (Smid et al., 2005). From gene
to function, from microbial biodiversity to ecological lifestyle,
from evolution to domestication: high-throughput techniques,
next-generation tools, and systems biology approaches offer the
opportunity to reconstruct the complete metabolic networks for
high-throughput comprehensive models of cell bio-productions
and starter robustness (Siezen et al., 2004; Guerzoni, 2010; Capozzi
and Spano, 2011; Roy et al., 2011; Suzzi, 2011; Altermann, 2012;
Diz et al., 2012).

FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION
Lactic acid bacteria may bioproduce functional molecules and/or
modulate (stabilize or increase) levels and bioaccessibility of bioac-
tive compounds. Here, a brief overview to appreciate the high
innovation content taking into account the potential health impli-
cations: (i) LAB may improve the palatability of whole grain and
ﬁber-rich products (Katina et al., 2005) associated with health

beneﬁts, such as enhanced regulation of blood glucose levels,
reduced risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain can-
cers (Jacobs et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2002);
(ii) LAB may modify the bran fraction of the grain (rich in
ﬁber) in such a way that larger amounts of bran can be uti-
lized in breads (Katina et al., 2005); (iii) LAB may contribute
to produce novel, naturally fermented health-oriented products
enriched in gamma-aminobutyric acid (Li and Cao, 2010; Li et al.,
2010); (iv) LAB may synthesize angiotensin I-converting enzyme
(ACE)-inhibitory peptides (Rizzello et al., 2011); (v) LAB may pro-
duce non-digestible polysaccharides, or modify accessibility of the
grain ﬁber complex to the gut microbiota (Poutanen et al., 2009;
Garai-Ibabe et al., 2010; Elizaquível et al., 2011).

THE GLUTEN-FREE ISSUE
In reason of current trends, an important ﬁeld of application of
LAB-based biotechnology is the huge growing gluten-free (GF)
market. This interesting niche requires high innovative contributes
to solve the celiac disease issue, also in the pasta segment. There
are two main routes to achieve this purpose: (i) the use of selected
LAB to degrade gluten (Gobbetti et al., 2007) and (ii) the employ of
particular LAB to increase the quality GF products (Moroni et al.,
2009). The ﬁrst strategy has been already applied to pasta manu-
facture (di Cagno et al., 2005): recent biotechnological evolution
couple lactobacilli and fungal proteases to improve durum wheat
semolina gluten degradation, maintaining cooking, and sensory
properties higher that those of conventional gluten-free pasta (De
Angelis et al., 2010). The second approach consider LAB “as ‘bur-
geoning’ cell factories for the delivering of functional biomolecules
and food ingredients for the production of high quality GF cereal
products” (Arendt et al., 2011), with the aim to improve texture,
aroma, nutritional properties, health beneﬁts and shelf life.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The question “Which strains for which application?” (Gänzle,
2009) well summarizes the future directions in this applied
biotechnological domain. Leroy and De Vuyst (2004) deﬁne a
starter culture as “a microbial preparation of large numbers of
cells of at least one microbial species to be added to a raw material

to produce a fermented food by accelerating and steering its fer-
mentation process.” In this speciﬁc application, the selection of
starter strains becomes more difﬁcult due to the non-fermented
status of the given food matrix. In fact, a key matter is represented
by the technological compatibility of the introduced microbial
innovation. Satisﬁed this starting point, two aspects should be
considered: (i) the introduced, possible advance has a multidi-
mensional structure, in reason of the many facets of pasta quality
perceived by consumers and of the different kind of process and
product innovations; (ii) many metabolic traits that determine the
performance of a starter culture in industrial practice are strain
speciﬁc (Gänzle, 2009). The selection of appropriate strains with
the successful combination of functional properties takes advan-
tage of the wide LAB biodiversity and metabolic variety occurring
in the sourdough ecosystems (Gänzle, 2009). In fact, the sponta-
neous food fermentations are carried out by mixed cultures, and
result from the competition within the indigenous microbial con-
sortium, in relation to a speciﬁc food substrate. Also in the design
of starter culture, mixed culture food fermentations are of primary
economic importance to introduce multivariate levels of innova-
tion (Sabra et al., 2010). “The performance of such cultures is not
the simple result of ‘adding up’ the individual single strain func-
tionalities but is largely determined by interactions at the level
of substrates, the exchange of metabolites and growth factors or
inhibiting compounds” (Sabra et al., 2010).

We conclude by highlighting the interesting innovation poten-
tial introduced with the adoption of a biotechnological LAB-based
step in pasta production. An exciting opportunity in a food sector
that is often referred to as “low-tech” (Kirner et al., 2009). Intense
applied research activities are needed to tailor the huge potential
of LAB in bread sourdough to pasta-making process.
