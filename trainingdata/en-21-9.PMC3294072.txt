The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) regulate protein trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes. 
Recent studies have shown that ESCRTs are involved in various cellular processes, including membrane scission, microRNA 
function, viral budding, and the autophagy pathway in many tissues, including the nervous system. Indeed, dysfunctional ESCRTs 
are associated with neurodegeneration. However, it remains largely elusive how ESCRTs act in post-mitotic neurons, a highly 
specialized cell type that requires dynamic changes in neuronal structures and signaling for proper function. Th  is review focuses on 
our current understandings of the functions of ESCRTs in neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION

Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are involved in the delivery of 
ubiquitinated cargo proteins to lysosomes for degradation. The 
endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) 
regulate the MVB pathway through MVB biogenesis and cargo 
sorting into lysosomes. The ESCRTs, first identified in yeast, are 
composed of four different protein complexes called ESCRT-0, 
-I, -II, -III and several accessory proteins. Each complex has 
multiple subunits and is sequentially and temporally recruited 
into the endosomal membrane during endocytic trafficking of 
cargo proteins. Ubiquitinated cargo proteins are recognized and 
captured by the ESCRT machinery [1, 2]. Emerging evidence 
suggests that different ubiquitin binding subunits regulate cargo 
sorting, membrane deformation, and final vesicle scission [1]. 
Among the ESCRT complexes, ESCRT-III is particularly involved 
in the invagination of cargo proteins into MVB vesicles. In the

final step, MVBs are fused with lysosomes for cargo protein 
degradation. Th  is machinery is functionally conserved from yeast 
to humans. ESCRT functions in the endo-lysosomal pathway have 
been extensively studied for the last 10~15 years using genetic 
or biochemical approaches with in vitro cell culture and in vivo 
models. Although the ESCRT function in regulating cell signaling 
through receptor downregulation has been well established, recent 
studies have suggested that ESCRTs are also involved in other 
cellular processes, including viral budding, cytokinesis, tumor 
suppression, autophagy, and microRNA function [2]. Moreover, 
ESCRT dysfunction is associated with several human diseases 
such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [3]. 
Neurons have specialized structures such as axons and dendrites 
that perform different functions. Dendrites receive and process 
information from axonal terminals that release neurotransmitters 
for proper neuronal signaling. This dynamic signaling of axons 
and dendrites requires the correct delivery of proper molecules 
to the target region depending on the tight regulation of protein 
sorting and degradation. Therefore, the regulation of neuronal 
cell signaling via the endo-lysosomal pathway in specialized 
regions of the dendritic and axonal membranes and the neuronal 
cell body is essential for neuronal cell survival, growth, synapse

formation, and various synaptic functions [4]. Indeed, dysfunction 
of the endocytic or lysosomal pathway is associated with several 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and 
Parkinson’s diseases [5]. Th  e ESCRT proteins that regulate the key 
sorting step of cargo proteins in the endosomal pathway are widely 
expressed in the central nervous system and their dysfunction 
can contribute to neurodegeneration [6, 7]. Additionally, the 
ESCRT machinery has been recently implicated in neuronal 
morphogenesis and synaptic function [6, 8-11]. However, the 
exact function of ESCRTs in neurons remains to be fully identifi ed. 
In this review, we will briefly summarize the composition of the 
ESCRT complexes and focus on ESCRT functions related to 
neuronal physiology and pathology. The readers are referred to 
several excellent reviews for more in-depth knowledge about 
ESCRT biology [1, 3, 12, 13].

THE ESCRT COMPLEXES

The ESCRTs were first identified as class E vacuolar protein 
sorting (Vps) proteins in yeast. Several genetic and biochemical 
studies have shown that loss of these genes causes the formation 
of abnormal MVBs lacking internal vesicles and the accumulation 
of cargo proteins, suggesting a role for ESCRTs in MVB biogenesis 
and cargo sorting [14]. The class E Vps proteins are functionally 
conserved from yeast to humans, indicating that the MVB 
pathway is universal. Interestingly, some Vps proteins in yeast have 
multiple mammalian paralogs, although the specific function 
of each paralog is currently being investigated under various 
biological contexts [15, 16]. The ESCRTs from four heteromeric 
protein complexes named ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III are involved 
in cargo recognition, cargo-sorting, and lipid membrane-
deformation by sequential recruitment and recycling of each 
complex into the endosomal membrane from the cytosol [1-3]. 

ESCRT-0
ESCRT-0 is composed of two subunits, hepatocyte growth factor 
regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs, Vps27p in yeast) and 
signal transducing adaptor molecule 1/2 (STAM, Hse1p in yeast), 
which can interact with ubiquitin. Among these components, Hrs 
controls the specificity and membrane recruitment of ESCRT-0 
at the endosome by binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [1, 
3]. Th  erefore, ESCRT-0 triggers the initiation of MVB-dependent 
cargo sorting by recruiting ESCRT-I into the endosomal 
membrane in yeast and metazoans [1, 3, 17].

ESCRT-I
Among ESCRTs, ESCRT-I was fi rst characterized in yeast, and it 

has four components, including Tsg101 (Vps23 in yeast), Vps28, 
Vps37, and recently identified Mvb12 [18, 19]. ESCRT-I binds 
to ESCRT-II and ESCRT-0 for further recruitment of ESCRT 
subunits and cargo proteins into endosomal membranes through 
the ubiquitin E2 variant domain of ESCRT-I subunits and the 
PTAP-like motif of ESCRT-0 subunits [17, 20].

ESCRT-II
ESCRT-II, which consists of Vps36, one Vps22, and two Vps25 
subunits, has eight winged-helix repeats [21]. The GRAM-like 
ubiquitin binding Eap45 domain in Vps36 is involved in binding 
to ubiquitin and 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in the 
endosomal membrane and also connects to Vps28 of ESCRT-I 
in yeast, although the link between ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II in 
mammals has yet to be characterized [22]. Vps25 contributes 
to initiating formation of the ESCRT-III complex through 
interaction with Vps20, which is an ESCRT-III subunit [2].

ESCRT-III
Unlike other ESCRT complexes, ESCRT-III consists of 
four highly charged subunits such as Vps20, Snf7, Vps24, and 
Vps2, and it does not form a stable cytosolic complex [23]. 
Interestingly, monomers of each ESCRT subunit are inactive due 
to their interaction with the N-terminus and the autoinhibitory 
C-terminus of the ESCRT-III component in the cytosol [13, 
24, 25]. Conformational changes in the ESCRT-III monomer 
precede the assembly of high-order multimers on membranes 
via interactions with other ESCRT-III subunits. The assembly 
of ESCRT-III begins with an interaction between Vps25 and 
Vps20, which recruits Snf7. Snf7, as the most abundant protein 
among ESCRT-III proteins, forms filamentous structures 
by homo-oligomerization leading to recruitment of Vps24-
Vps2. Then, Vps24-Vps2 recruits AAA ATPase Vps4 into the 
endosomal membrane to disassemble the ESCRT-III complex 
from the membrane [26, 27]. Bro1/Alix can also regulate the 
Snf7 nucleation process in an ESCRT-II-independent manner. 
The assembly of ESCRT-III is involved in driving membrane 
deformation [27]. Additionally, accessory proteins such as Ist1, 
Doa4-independent degradation-2 (Did2), and Vps twenty-
associated 1 (Vta1) regulate Vps4 function for the proper recycling 
of ESCRT-III subunits [28-30].

ESCRTS IN POST-MITOTIC NEURONS

A signifi cant amount of membrane traffi  cking and cargo protein 
sorting occurs in specialized compartments in post-mitotic 
neurons during neuronal diff erentiation and function. In addition,

maturation [9]. FTD-linked CHMP2B mutant proteins induce 
a reduction in large mushroom-shaped spines, and the loss of 
CHMP2B in cultured hippocampal neurons also shows similar 
abnormal spine morphology. Th  erefore, neuronal ESCRTs induce 
neuronal morphological changes possibly by endocytic sorting 
of cargo proteins involved in neuronal growth and maintenance 
of neuronal morphology. Whether ESCRTs have other functions 
in neuronal morphogenesis independent of the endo-lysosomal 
pathway remains to be seen. The exact function of ESCRTs in 
neuronal morphogenesis should be also evaluated in an in vivo 
mouse model. 

ESCRTs in endosomal traffi  cking at synapses in neurons
Neurons require highly dynamic neuronal signaling in axons 
and dendrites. Th  e ESCRTs are localized at axons and dendrites, 
indicating their possible roles in endosomal trafficking at 
presynaptic and postsynaptic sites [6, 8]. An increasing body of 
evidence shows that ESCRTs together with other regulators in 
the endocytic pathway regulate cargo protein sorting at synapses. 
Synaptic proteins at axonal terminals undergo a dynamic 
recycling and degradation to regulate presynaptic growth and 
neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, a recent study suggested 
that the ESCRT complex mediates synaptic vesicle protein 
sorting in sky (Rab 32 GAP in Drosophila) mutants where 
synaptic vesicles are recycled excessively via endosomes [10]. 
Besides protein sorting in the sky mutant, artificially generated 
ubiquitinated synaptic vesicle proteins are degraded in an ESCRT-
dependent manner, suggesting that ESCRTs might control the 
nature and steady-state level of proteins involved in synaptic 
vesicle recycling and neuronal signaling. Another example of 
neuronal ESCRTs in the nerve terminal is the ESCRT-dependent 
presynaptic endosomal trafficking pathway to control synaptic 
growth signals. ESCRTs together with SNX16 regulate synaptic 
growth at the interface between endosomal compartments [11]. 
The surface level of several neurotransmitter receptors or 
membrane proteins at post-synaptic sites is crucial for temporal 
and spatial neuronal signaling, and this can be regulated by the 
endosomal trafficking pathway. Indeed, loss of Snf7s in human 
neurons causes the accumulation of neurotransmitter receptors 
such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), GluR1, NR1, 
and TrkA or membrane proteins such as APP [16]. Additionally, 
recent data show that the GPCR interacting scaff old protein, which 
is a brain-specific scaffold protein, retards TSG101-dependent 
lysosomal degradation of neurotransmitter receptors through 
its interaction with TSG101 [34, 35]. However, the mechanism 
of how synaptic cargo proteins are specifically recognized by 
ESCRTs and are sorted into proper endosomal compartments 

Fig. 1. Neuronal ESCRT as a multiplayer in post-mitotic neurons. 
ESCRTs regulate endocytic trafficking, membrane deformation, or the 
autophagy pathway in post-mitotic neurons, although they are involved 
in other unknown cellular processes. Neuronal ESCRTs control neuronal 
morphogenesis such as axonal and dendritic growth, synaptic growth, 
and may affect neuronal signaling at synaptic sites by down-regulating 
signaling molecules in response to various synaptic activities. Furthermore, 
neuronal homeostasis is regulated by controlling the degradation of cargo 
proteins or cytosolic components via the ESCRT involved in the auto-
lysosomal pathway. Interestingly, the ESCRT may directly or indirectly 
contribute to neuronal cell death. Some ESCRT components may be 
linked to the cell death pathway in a direct manner. Dysfunction of 
ESCRTs can cause neurodegeneration leading to neuronal cell death.

endosomal trafficking and lysosomal functions in the central 
nervous system play important roles in neuronal cell survival and 
proper neuronal signaling. Therefore, these pathways should be 
tightly regulated. ESCRTs are key components that regulate sorting 
and degradation of cargo proteins and membrane deformation. 
Thus, neuronal ESCRTs must be important players in various 
neuronal functions (Fig. 1). 

ESCRTs in neuronal morphogenesis
 Neurons have highly polarized structures such as axons and 
dendrites, which are striking features of a mature nervous system. 
During axonal or dendritic growth and arborization, many 
membrane proteins such as TrkB or Eph receptors in response to 
proper signals may be sorted into the endo-lysosomal pathway to 
regulate neuronal morphogenesis [31, 32]. Indeed, loss of Shrub, 
which is a major component of ESCRT-III in Drosphila PNS 
neurons, results in a dramatic decrease in the dendritic fi eld and 
an increase in dendritic branching in a cell-autonomous manner, 
indicating the role of ESCRT-III in the control of neuronal 
morphogenesis [8]. Furthermore, dysfunction of ESCRT-III 
either by loss of mammalian Snf7-2, which is a homolog of 
Drosophila Shrub, or by overexpression of frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD)-linked CHMP2B mutant protein in cultured 
mature cortical neurons causes dendritic retraction, suggesting 
that neuronal ESCRT-III is involved in the maintenance of 
dendritic morphology [6, 33]. Interestingly, a recent study 
suggested that neuronal CHMP2B also regulates dendritic spine

remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the specifi c function of each 
ESCRT complex during trafficking and degradation of synaptic 
cargo proteins in response to various synaptic activities needs to 
be investigated. Further characterization of neuronal ESCRTs in 
synapses will help us to understand the functions of ESCRTs in 
synaptic plasticity.

ESCRTs in neuronal cell death 
Endocytosis associated with the autophagy pathway increases 
massively during neuronal cell death at the early developmental 
stages, indicating that activation of the endo-lysosomal pathway is 
required for some types of cell death [36]. Alix, fi rst characterized 
as an ALG-2 interacting protein, binds to TSG101 and Snf7-2 
(also known as CHMP4b) [37-39]. Alix overexpression induces 
apoptosis in cultured cerebellar granule neurons and in the 
developing chick spinal cord, suggesting that ESCRT-associated 
Alix might cause neuronal cell death [36]. Interestingly, disrupting 
the interaction between Alix and ESCRTs inhibits neuronal cell 
death, supporting the idea that the Alix/ESCRT complex could 
contribute to neuronal cell death. Further studies are needed to 
uncover the detailed mechanism by which Alix/ESCRT induces 
neuronal cell death [40, 41].

ESCRTs in neurodegeneration
Several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s 
disease, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease are 
associated with abnormal endo-lysosomal functions [42]. 
Among endo-lysosomal proteins, ESCRT dysfunction could 
also lead to neurodegeneration and it is associated with some 
neurodegenerative diseases. The mutation in CHMP2B, a key 
component of ESCRT-III, was fi rstly identifi ed in frontotemporal 
dementia linked to chromosome-3 (FTD-3), raising the possibility 
that dysfunction of ESCRT is associated with the pathogenesis 
of FTD [33]. This was supported by the finding that the FTD-
linked mutant CHMP2B protein, a key component of ESCRT-
III, causes dendritic retraction and accumulation of ubiquitinated 
proteins and autophagosomes leading to neuronal cell loss 
in cultured cortical neurons [6, 33, 43]. Interestingly, several 
mutations in CHMP2B have been subsequently identified in 
patients with FTD, FTD-MND (Frontotemporal dementia with 
motor neuron diseases), or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
[44-46]. Moreover, strong CHMP2B immunopositivity during 
granulovacuolar degeneration of neurons has been detected in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease, indicating that CHMP2B is 
associated with a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases 
[47]. Additionally, loss of Hrs, which is a core component of 
ESCRT-I in the central nervous system of a mice model, causes 

accumulation of ubiquitinated protein, neurodegeneration, and 
impaired learning ability and locomotor activity [7]. Th  ese studies 
support the essential role of ESCRTs in neuronal cell survival and 
protein homeostasis. 
There are other examples of ESCRT dysfunction associated 
neurodegeneration. Spongiform neurodegeneration-associated 
E3 ligase Mahogunin ubiquitylates TSG101 and regulates 
endosomal trafficking. Loss of Mahogunin in an animal model 
results in abnormal regulation of TSG101 leading to spongiform 
neurodegeneration [48, 49]. The dysfunction of accessory 
proteins related to the ESCRT complex is also associated with 
neurodegeneration. Th  e ESCRT-III-associated endosomal protein 
CHMP1B interacts with the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein 
(HSP) spastin, increasing the possibility of a contribution by 
CHMP1B in the pathogenesis of HSP [50]. 
If so, how does ESCRT dysfunction lead to neurodegeneration? 
ESCRT dysfunction disrupts endosomal trafficking and 
degradation of cargo proteins, which contribute to cellular 
toxicity and neurodegeneration. Besides endo-lysosomal 
dysfunction, ESCRT dysfunction causes accumulation of 
autophagosomes probably due to the inhibition of the maturation 
of autophago somes to autolysosomes [6, 33, 51]. Inhibiting the 
accumulation of autophagosomes delays ESCRT dysfunction-
induced  neurodegeneration,  suggesting  that  autophagy 
could partially contribute to neuronal cell loss under some 
circumstances [52]. Therefore, understanding of how ESCRTs 
are involved in endosomal traffic and the fusion or maturation 
of autophagosomes will no doubt lead to better understanding 
of the molecular pathogenic events in several neurodegenerative 
diseases associated with ESCRTs.

CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES

Much has been learned about the ESCRT functions in 
various biological systems. Neuronal ESCRTs function as key 
endocytic regulators of cargo protein sorting between endosomal 
compartments and as a modifier of membrane dynamics 
(membrane deformation and scission). Additionally, neuronal 
ESCRTs are required for neuronal homeostasis by controlling 
maturation of autophagosomes and degradation of cargo proteins 
in the auto-lysosomal pathway (Fig. 1). Despite our current 
knowledge about ESCRT functions, many questions still remain. 
For instance, the spatial and temporal regulation and specificity 
of ESCRTs under dynamic neuronal signaling need to be further 
elucidated. 
Unlike their yeast counterparts, mammalian ESCRTs have 
multiple isoforms. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that the

distinct ESCRT complex may have distinct functional specifi city 
[15, 16, 53]. Whether each isoform of the neuronal ESCRT 
complex has specificity in its expression and localization in 
axons or dendrites, in subunit composition, or in cargo selection 
should be further elucidated. All of these studies will provide 
a further understanding of the neuronal functions of ESCRTs 
and may lead to the development of therapeutic intervention for 
neurodegenerative diseases associated with ESCRTs.
