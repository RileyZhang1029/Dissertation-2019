We submitted a query to PQ using the starting search terms BuddChiari syndrome and its NCBI medical subject heading (MeSH) term alias.
PQ retrieved more than 2200 papers.
The network obtained by PQ was an undirected proteinprotein network consisting of 76 nodes that represent 76 proteins cited in at least one document and 174 edges indicating co-occurrence of two proteins in at least one document.
A screenshot of the plugin is shown in Figure 1, whereas a quick guide of the BuddChiari syndrome network can be downloaded at the SourceForge project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/funmodnetwork/).
Using FunMod we identified 33 different biological pathways that are significantly enriched in the BuddChiari syndrome network.
Table 1 shows 13 most relevant pathways.
The most significant one is related to the coagulation cascades, which is in agreement with the previous reports that Budd Chiari is a disorder frequently characterized by the thrombotic Figure 1 Screenshot of FunMod plugin in action Screenshot shows the bibliometric network of proteins related to Budd and color density are proportional to the occurrence of the protein t nodes represents the co-occurrence, and its thickness is proportional abstract or figure caption.

This result indicated that FunMod, relying on the ABC principle (A and C have no direct connection but are connected via shared B intermediates) [47,48] to establish new relationships between proteins from literature co-occurrence, can be effectively used to combine information from the relevant scientific literature and from pathway databases, supporting the discovery of new knowledge.
Moreover, we calculated the three types of topological coefficients of each pathway sub-network with FunMod and selected the most relevant pathways using three types of coefficients.
As shown in Figure 2, fibrinolysis pathway was exemplified as a clique module (Figure 2A), the JAK-STAT pathway as an example of a star module (Figure 2B), and the platelet activation, signaling and aggregation as an example of path module (Figure 2C).
By examining the topological feature of a sub-network functional module, we can extract information of pathways functioning in BuddChiari syndrome.
The cliques represent a highly connected sub-network, where the proteins of the pathway are highly co-studied and co-cited.
The fibrinolysis pathway is the central pathway in BuddChiari syndrome, consistent with the fact that prothrombotic tendency is caused by abnormalities in the coagulation of fibrinolysis pathways [49].
These data may explain why the fibrinolysis pathway functional sub-network is represented by a clique.
A star module represents a functional sub-network where a protein plays Chiari syndrome.
Proteins are displayed as pink nodes and the size erm in the literature of BuddChiari syndrome.

Indeed JAK2 is the hub (the central node) in the JAK-STAT pathway sub-network.
Moreover, a mutation in JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F) is frequently found in patients with BuddChiari syndrome [50,51].
Finally, the path module represents a significant pathway in the context of the disease, which is not studied comprehensively.
The platelet activation, signaling and aggregation pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of Budd Chiari syndrome [52].
von Willebrand factor (vWF) [53] and SerpinA1 [54], two peripheral sub-network proteins that were recently described as markers of abnormalities of coagulation play roles in provoking thrombosis [55].
The information extracted by FunMod will provide guidance for the future study on BuddChiari syndrome.
Case study 2: Analysis of a co-expression network Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inheritable neuromuscular disorder, leading to degeneration of a-motor neurons, due to recessive mutations of the SMN1 gene [56].
No treatment is currently available for curing SMA patients, and the development of a computational approach could facilitate a better understanding of this disease and identification of potential therapeutic targets.
In the second case study, we applied FunMod to analyze a co-expression network obtained using PQ and COXPRESdb.
The proteinprotein interactions within this co-expression network reveal proteins examined in the context of SMA and that are simultaneously documented to be co-regulated at mRNA level.
The analysis of gene coexpression network provides powerful searching ability that allowed us to identify more than 400 functional clusters related to SMA.
In this case study, we examined all proteins involved in SMA using PQ and found that 1482 proteins were cited in PubMed articles describing SMA.
This list of proteins was submitted to COXPRESdb [35], a publicly-available coexpression database, which provides a tool to export the networks in Cytoscape.
We used a co-expression network to enhance the predictive power of the informative network.
We submitted the list of SMA proteins to COXPRESdb and obtained a co-expression protein network with 2022 nodes and 9166 edges (Figure 3).
Further analyzing the SMA co-expression network using FunMod, we identified 429 functional modules and the 13 most relevant modules were shown in Table 2.

The network can be downloaded in the XGMML format, the standard format for saving and importing network into Cytoscape, and imported into a stand-alone Cytoscape distribution for advanced analyses.
NetworkDrawer performs cluster detection and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, providing a node color scale to indicate protein localization: cytosol (green); cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, lysosome, peroxisome and plasma membrane (gray); mitochondrion (cyan); nucleus (yellow); and extracellular matrix (white).
The edge represents the type of interaction between two nodes: gene co-expression (solid in black) and indicates known proteinprotein interaction (dotted in red).

Natale M et al/Identifying Functional Modules in ProteinProtein Networks 183 FunMod identified a few pathways known to be related to systemic aspects of neurodegenerative conditions, such as the AGE-RAGE pathway [57], striated muscle contraction [58] and leptin signaling pathway [59].
FunMod identified the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) signaling among the most relevant pathway (Figure 4A).

Therefore, this finding validates the ability of our software to reveal new relevant functional modules.
Interestingly, FunMod identified the androgen receptor signaling pathway in SMA co-expression network as well (Figure 4B).
Androgens interact with BDNF during development to regulate non-pathological death of motor neurons.
Androgens regulate BDNF levels in the target musculature and moreover, androgenic actions at the muscle regulate BDNF levels in motoneurons [61].
Therefore, these interactions have important implications for the maintenance of motoneuron morphology.
These findings provide further insights into the pathogenic role of BDNF and androgens in SMA, which might be a preferential route for targeting motor neurons [62].
Conclusion Using a first topological assignment strategy to identify subnetwork functional modules, such as stars and cliques, can be tricky because informative networks are known to have a huge number of edges that are not always pertinent to biological functions.
In this work we presented FunMod, a new Cytoscape 2.8 plugin, which can analyze undirected protein networks, such as co-occurrence and co-expression networks, and guide the discovery of sub-network functional modules.
A functional module can be considered as a distinct group of interacting proteins [32] within a pathway relevant to a condition of interest.
FunMod identifies within an informative network, pairs of nodes belonging to the same biological pathways and assesses their statistical significance.
It then analyzes the topology of the identified sub-network to infer the topological relations (motifs) of its nodes.
In this work, the network topology is influenced by the biomedical knowledge since the link between two proteins was established when two gene symbols appear in the same MEDLINE record.
The study of the connection between biomedical concepts by using co-occurrence network extracted from MEDLINE proved capable of guiding the discovery of novel knowledge from scientific literature [63].
This sub-network profiling combined with information from the biological database will help us to better understand the biological significance of the protein protein network.
FunMod was tested using the co-occurrence network of proteins cited in BuddChiari syndrome papers, identifying 33 different biological pathways that are significantly enriched; and using the co-expression network of proteins discussed in publications on SMA.
FunMod proves to be a useful tool for a better understanding of the cooperative interactions between proteins and discriminating the biological role played by each protein within a functional module.
