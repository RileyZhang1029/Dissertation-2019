In this paper we present FunMod, an innovative Cytoscape version 2.8 plugin that is able to mine undirected pro- tein protein networks and to infer sub-networks of interacting proteins intimately correlated with relevant biological pathways.
This plugin may enable the discovery of new pathways involved in dis- eases.
In order to describe the role of each protein within the relevant biological pathways, FunMod computes and scores three topological features of the identiﬁed sub-networks.
By integrating the results from biological pathway clustering and topological network analysis, FunMod proved to be useful for the data interpretation and the generation of new hypotheses in two case studies.
Systems biology broadly uses networks to model and discover emerging properties among genes, proteins and other relevant biomolecules.
Theoretical studies have indicated that biologi- cal networks share many features with other types of networks, as computer or social networks [1].
Therefore, biological net- work analyses allow the application of mathematical and com- putational methods of the graph theory to biological studies [2].
The computational analysis of biological networks has therefore become increasingly useful to mine the complex  * Corresponding author.

cellular processes and signaling pathways [3].
Many types of biological networks exist, depending on the information asso- ciated with their nodes and edges.
In general, biological net- works can be classiﬁed as directed and undirected networks [4].
In directed networks, the nodes are molecules and edges represent causal biological interactions, such as the transcrip- tion and translation regulations [5].
In contrast, in undirected networks, an edge indicates a shared property, such as the sequence similarity [6], gene co-expression [7], protein protein interaction [8], or the term co-occurrence in the scientiﬁc liter- ature [9 11].
In order to extract relevant biological implication from undirected networks, which are also called informative networks [12], it is useful to complement the topological infor- mation with the independent biological information retrieved from Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway databases.
Often the goal is to identify densely-interconnected areas and  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2014.05.002 1672-0229 ª 2014 The Authors.

Natale M et al / Identifying Functional Modules in Protein Protein Networks  179  correlate them with a speciﬁc biological function [13,14].
Sev- eral algorithms and bioinformatic tools have been proposed for partitioning the network into structural modules, or for clustering sub-network modules within an informative net- work [15,16].
Researchers in Bioinformatics developed Cyto- scape plugins [17] to mine functional modules in a varieties of network types, such as Clust&See [18], clusterMaker [19], CyClus3D [20], GLay [21] and Enrichment Map [22].
These plugins mainly function on the basis of topological properties.
The groups of highly-interconnected nodes may form clusters based on a   ﬁrst topological clustering   strategy, which aimed at partitioning complex networks into modules.
The biological functions are then assigned assuming that members within each sub-network shared a similar biological function [23].
However, clusters are identiﬁed solely on the basis of the topol- ogy.
Therefore, the possibility of co-occurrence events cannot be ruled out using these methods.
Moreover, these strategies are heavily inﬂuenced by the topological structure of the net- work itself, and the way that the network is constructed [24].
In practice, the connectivity of the informative networks is established by experimental methods, which can lead to sam- pling of a subnet of the real biological network [25,26].
Often, biases in the sampling strategies lead to apparent scale-free topologies, which do not reﬂect the actual complete network topology.
As an alternate to the   ﬁrst topological clustering   methods, some authors used a   ﬁrst pathway enrichment   strategy [27], which enables analyzing gene networks and extracting functional modules starting from the biological enrichment analysis.
Several Cytoscape plugins thus have been implemented owning to this strategy, such as BiNGO [28], Clu- eGO [29], ClusterViz [30], JEPETTO [31] and Reactome [32].
BiNGO and ClueGO are widely used tools to determine which biological functions are statistically over-represented in a list of genes or a network.
These plugins offer the possibil- ity to calculate enrichment by using different statistical algo- rithms.
However, they do not evaluate the connectivity between genes, and do not take into account the possibility that nodes spread in the network could still represent a signif- icant biological function.
A recent focus of bioinformatics has been to develop the computational tools that are able to mine the connectivity of gene networks and uncover the sets of molecules that partici- pate in a common biological function [33].
Reactome is estab- lished based on an un-weighted human protein functional interaction network and the functional interaction score was calculated with Pearson correlation coefﬁcients among all gene pairs in the biological database.
The weighted network was clustered into a series of gene interaction modules using the Markov clustering algorithm.
Each module of the Reactome consists of a set of genes that are both connected in the protein functional interaction network and highly-correlated in biolog- ical databases [34].
This approach, however, does not consider the topology or the connectivity of gene interaction modules.
JEPETTO identiﬁes functional associations between genes and pathways using protein interaction networks and topolog- ical analyses.
Although JEPPETTO combines network analy- sis with functional enrichment, this tool requires a list of genes in input and the selection of a database of interest from which the reference gene sets will be extracted.
Reactome and JEPETTO are based on an internal gene interaction database, in which the users are not able to ﬁlter this pre-deﬁned database or to analyze their own protein  informative networks.
Nowadays there are a great number of tools able to produce undirected protein networks from a user-deﬁned query, such as protein protein interaction net- work (STRING, BioGRID, etc.
), co-expression network (COXPRESdb) [35] and co-occurrence network (Protein- Quest) [36].
To the best of our knowledge, there is no software available to identify sub-networks of genes that are highly connected and belong to the same biological pathways.
Moreover, the aforementioned plugins do not allow the analysis of user- deﬁned undirected networks, such as protein protein interac- tion, functional association, gene co-expression and literature co-occurrence.
In this work we developed a new approach using a   ﬁrst biological assignment   strategy and we implemented our method as a Cytoscape plugin, called FunMod.
According to the principle that interacting proteins drive common biological processes, FunMod analyzes informative networks combing topological and biological information to identify and extract sub-network modules in proteins that are involved in the same biological pathway.
Moreover, in order to describe the shape of the modules and discriminate the proteins  topological pro- prieties within the single sub-network, FunMod analyzes sub- network features by using three topological scores.
The sub- networks that are statistically overrepresented can act as build- ing blocks of complex informative networks and carry out a speciﬁc biological function [24].
Assessment of the sub-net- work topological proprieties and shapes can consequently be used for the gene ranking in the context of a speciﬁc research domain, such as a disease [35].
In the present study, FunMod proves to be a useful method for identifying functional sub-networks in an informative pro- tein network, exploring biomedical information and inferring automated functional hypotheses between an user deﬁned pro- tein protein network [36].
FunMod is unique at its capability of analyzing user-deﬁned undirected networks, in order to pro- vide more realistic models that incorporate information from certain cellular types, developmental states and/or disease conditions.
Methods  FunMod analyzes the informative protein network displayed in the Cytoscape Main Network View window.
The plugin supports many standard protein dictionaries, the protein nodes can be identiﬁed (node ID) by six different dictionaries: Entrez Gene ID, Ensembl, Ofﬁcial Symbol (HGNC symbol), NCBI Reference Sequence, UniGene and Uniprot Entry Name.
FunMod iteratively selects all edges of the network and assigns a functional annotation to an edge when two linked nodes are annotated in the same biological group or pathway in the Consen- susPathDB (DB) database [37].
In other words, FunMod considers an order pair network G = (V, E), where vertices (V, nodes) join with edges (E), and collects, for each ConsensusPathDB pathway, pairs of linked nodes to model a functional sub-network Gp = (Vp, Ep), where Vp   ends on the pathways and Ep 2 E. FunMod per- forms a global enrichment analysis screening the pathways whose proteins are co-annotated with their neighbors.
Accordingly, all the pathways identiﬁed by FunMod are also signiﬁcant in a global enrichment analysis, since the connected nodes are a fraction of nodes in the network.
So pathways enriched in a sub-network   180  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 178 186  are also enriched in the global network, but only a few pathways enriched in the global network are enriched in a cluster.
Our algo- rithm thus could ﬁnd the pathways enriched in the global network and whose proteins are densely connected within a sub-network.
FunMod extracts all pairs of nodes annotated for the same pathway in a new sub-network.
Subsequently, FunMod tests the statistical signiﬁcance and calculates the topological prop- erties of the sub-network to identify the sub-networks that are statistically enriched in biological functions and that exhibiting interesting topological features.
The statistical signiﬁcance of the sub-network is determined by performing a hypergeomet- ric test, a well-established method used in gene enrichment analyses [27].
The hypergeometric probability (h) is based on the following formula:            h ðx  X  n  NÞ ¼ X  x     N X n x N n  ð1Þ  where x is the number of nodes of the sub-network (the items in the sample that are classiﬁed as success), n is the number of genes in the network (items in the sample)  X is the number of genes annotated in the DB with that pathway (items in the population that are classiﬁed as success) and N is the number of all genes annotated in DB (items in the population).
FunMod preserves the sub-networks with a P value  0.05.
For a better understanding of the systemic functions and the cooperative interactions between genes within the func- tional modules, FunMod checks whether the sub-network topology ﬁts into a speciﬁc module.
Network modules repre- sent patterns occurring signiﬁcantly more often than random in the complex networks.
They consist of sub-graphs of local interconnections between network elements.
FunMod calcu- lates a ﬁtting score of each sub-network for three types of modules: clique, star and path [38].
A clique is a sub-network in which all nodes are connected to each other.
Cliques are the most widely-used modules for assigning a biological function to a topological sub-network.
FunMod calculates the tendency to be a clique by graph den- sity (GD), a score that can also be deﬁned as the local cluster- ing coefﬁcient, using the formula:  GD ¼  2E  n   ðn   1Þ  ð2Þ  where E is the number of edges in the sub-network and n is the number of genes in the sub-network.
The star module is particularly interesting for identifying drug targets.
It is characterized by a central gene with a high degree connection to a set of ﬁrst-degree neighbors, which are loosely connected between each other.
In a star sub-net- work, the central gene (the hub gene) has inﬂuence on its neighbor genes and possibly on the whole network.
To identify a star module, FunMod calculates the sub-network centraliza- tion (CE) using the formula:     CE ¼ n  ðn   2Þ   maxðkÞ n   1      GD  ð3Þ  where max(k) is the highest degree of central gene connection in the sub-network and n is the number of genes in the sub- network.
The path module corresponds to a real pathway where the genes contribute to a signal transduction.
The path score is  evaluated by the sub-network diameter (D), which uses the maximum length of all shortest paths between any two connected nodes, using the formula: D ¼ max  dminði  jÞ  ð4Þ  i j  where dmin is the minimum path between two nodes i and j of the network.
Pathways identiﬁed using FunMod were displayed in the Cytoscape Results Panel and ranked based on their P values.
For each pathway, FunMod displays its clique, star and path coefﬁcients.
By clicking the   Pathway   button, FunMod selects the corresponding nodes in the network.
And by using the   View subnet   function, it creates a new network contain- ing only those genes and edges annotated within that pathway.
Moreover, FunMod enables saving the results in a tab-delim- ited ﬁle.

Results and discussion  Gene Ontology (GO) provides information on the location of genes and gene products in a cell or the extracellular environ- ment and also on the molecular function they carry out.
How- ever, GO does not provide information about the interaction of proteins in the same biological context.
For example, GO does not allow us to describe genes in terms of which cells or tissues they are expressed in, which developmental stages they are expressed at, or their involvement in disease (http:// www.geneontology.org/GO.doc.shtml).
We thus chose Con- sensusPathDB [39] that are strictly involved in the same pathways.
We also assess the topological shape of each sub-network in order to reveal evidence of its biological function and the function of its components.
Three topological scores are calculated to describe the global features of the sub-network: graph density, network centralization and shortest path.
Other topological scores, such as centrality and degree, describe the relative importance of a single node within the sub-network and thus left out in FunMod.
to identify proteins  To demonstrate the usage and performance of FunMod, we showed here case studies to analyze two different informative networks: a bibliometric network of proteins related to the Budd Chiari syndrome and a co-expression network of pro- teins related to spinal muscular atrophy.
Identiﬁcation of the sub-network functional modules in the undirected protein net- works allows the reduction in network complexity, clustering of proteins on the basis of common biological functions and discovery of the mechanisms underlying a disease [40].
Case study 1: Analysis of a bibliometric network  Budd Chiari syndrome is an uncommon condition character- ized by obstruction of the hepatic venous outﬂow tract [41].
Budd Chiari syndrome is difﬁcult for diagnosis and manage- ment and often fatal if not treated optimally, since none of the current medical therapies are based on the clinical evidence due to the difﬁculty in performing appropriate clinical studies   Natale M et al / Identifying Functional Modules in Protein Protein Networks  181  on a sufﬁcient number of patients with this rare disease [42].
In this circumstance, a meta-analysis can be useful to provide valuable information for researchers to understand the mech- anism of this disease [43].
In this case study, we used ProteinQuest (PQ), an advanced text-mining tool that resorts to the web services offered by PubMed to identify all proteins co-cited in the same abstract or ﬁgure legend [44] and to export the literature co-occurrence information as a network ﬁle that can be managed in Cyto- scape.
We submitted a query to PQ using the starting search terms   Budd Chiari syndrome   and its NCBI medical subject heading (MeSH) term alias.
PQ retrieved more than 2200 papers.
The network obtained by PQ was an undirected pro- tein protein network consisting of 76 nodes that represent 76 proteins cited in at least one document and 174 edges indicat- ing co-occurrence of two proteins in at least one document.
A screenshot of the plugin is shown in Figure 1, whereas a quick guide of the Budd Chiari syndrome network can be downloaded at the SourceForge project page (http://source- forge.net/projects/funmodnetwork/).
Using FunMod we identiﬁed 33 different biological path- ways that are signiﬁcantly enriched in the Budd Chiari syn- drome network.
Table 1 shows 13 most relevant pathways.
The most signiﬁcant one is related to the coagulation cascades, which is in agreement with the previous reports that Budd  Chiari is a disorder frequently characterized by the thrombotic  obstruction of hepatic venous outﬂow [45,46].
This result indi- cated that FunMod, relying on the ABC principle (A and C have no direct connection but are connected via shared B inter- mediates) [47,48] to establish new relationships between pro- teins from literature co-occurrence, can be effectively used to combine information from the relevant scientiﬁc literature and from pathway databases, supporting the discovery of new knowledge.
Moreover, we calculated the three types of topological coefﬁcients of each pathway sub-network with FunMod and selected the most relevant pathways using three types of coefﬁcients.
As shown in Figure 2, ﬁbrinolysis path- way was exempliﬁed as a clique module (Figure 2A), the JAK-STAT pathway as an example of a star module (Figure 2B), and the platelet activation, signaling and aggrega- tion as an example of path module (Figure 2C).
By examining the topological feature of a sub-network functional module, we can extract information of pathways functioning in Budd Chiari syndrome.
The cliques represent a highly connected sub-network, where the proteins of the pathway are highly co-studied and co-cited.
The ﬁbrinolysis pathway is the central pathway in Budd Chiari syndrome, consistent with the fact that prothrombotic tendency is caused by abnormalities in the coagulation of ﬁbrinolysis pathways [49].
These data may explain why the ﬁbrinolysis pathway functional sub-network is represented by a clique.
A star mod- ule represents a functional sub-network where a protein plays  Screenshot of FunMod plugin in action  Figure 1 Screenshot shows the bibliometric network of proteins related to Budd Chiari syndrome.

a central role in the pathway.
Indeed JAK2 is the hub (the cen- tral node) in the JAK-STAT pathway sub-network.
Moreover, a mutation in JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F) is fre- quently found in patients with Budd Chiari syndrome [50,51].
Finally, the path module represents a signiﬁcant path- way in the context of the disease, which is not studied compre- hensively.
The platelet activation, signaling and aggregation pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of Budd  Chiari syndrome [52].
von Willebrand factor (vWF) [53] and SerpinA1 [54], two peripheral sub-network proteins that were recently described as markers of abnormalities of coagulation play roles in provoking thrombosis [55].
The information extracted by FunMod will provide guidance for the future study on Budd Chiari syndrome.
Case study 2: Analysis of a co-expression network  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inheritable neuromuscu- lar disorder, leading to degeneration of a-motor neurons, due to recessive mutations of the SMN1 gene [56].
No treatment is currently available for curing SMA patients, and the develop- ment of a computational approach could facilitate a better  understanding of this disease and identiﬁcation of potential therapeutic targets.
In the second case study, we applied FunMod to analyze a co-expression network obtained using PQ and COXPRESdb.
The protein protein interactions within this co-expression network reveal proteins examined in the context of SMA and that are simultaneously documented to be co-regulated at mRNA level.
The analysis of gene co- expression network provides powerful searching ability that allowed us to identify more than 400 functional clusters related to SMA.
In this case study, we examined all proteins involved in SMA using PQ and found that 1482 proteins were cited in PubMed articles describing SMA.
This list of proteins was submitted to COXPRESdb [35], a publicly-available co- expression database, which provides a tool to export the net- works in Cytoscape.
We used a co-expression network to enhance the predictive power of the informative network.
We submitted the list of SMA proteins to COXPRESdb and obtained a co-expression protein network with 2022 nodes and 9166 edges (Figure 3).
Further analyzing the SMA co-expression network using FunMod, we identiﬁed 429 func- tional modules and the 13 most relevant modules were shown in Table 2.

Therefore, this ﬁnding validates the ability of our software to reveal new relevant Interestingly, FunMod identiﬁed the androgen receptor signaling pathway in SMA co-expression network as well (Figure 4B).
Androgens interact with BDNF during development to regulate non-path- ological death of motor neurons.
Androgens regulate BDNF levels in the target musculature and moreover, androgenic actions at the muscle regulate BDNF levels in motoneurons [61].
Therefore, these interactions have important implications for the maintenance of motoneuron morphology.
These ﬁnd- ings provide further insights into the pathogenic role of BDNF and androgens in SMA, which might be a preferential route for targeting motor neurons [62].
Conclusion  Using a   ﬁrst topological assignment   strategy to identify sub- network functional modules, such as stars and cliques, can be tricky because informative networks are known to have a huge number of edges that are not always pertinent to biological functions.
In this work we presented FunMod, a new Cyto- scape 2.8 plugin, which can analyze undirected protein net- works, such as co-occurrence and co-expression networks, and guide the discovery of sub-network functional modules.
A functional module can be considered as a distinct group of interacting proteins [32] within a pathway relevant to a condi- tion of interest.
FunMod identiﬁes within an informative network, pairs of nodes belonging to the same biological pathways and assesses their statistical signiﬁcance.
It then analyzes the topology of the identiﬁed sub-network to infer the topolog- ical relations (motifs) of its nodes.
In this work, the network topology is inﬂuenced by the biomedical knowledge since the link between two proteins was established when two gene symbols appear in the same MEDLINE record.
The study  of the connection between biomedical concepts by using co-occurrence network extracted from MEDLINE proved capable of guiding the discovery of novel knowledge from scientiﬁc literature [63].
This sub-network proﬁling combined with information from the biological database will help us to better understand the biological signiﬁcance of the protein  protein network.
FunMod was tested using the co-occurrence network of proteins cited in Budd Chiari syndrome papers, identifying 33 different biological pathways signiﬁcantly enriched  and using the co-expression network of proteins discussed in publications on SMA.
FunMod proves to be a useful tool for a better understanding of the cooperative interactions between proteins and discriminating the biolog- ical role played by each protein within a functional module.
