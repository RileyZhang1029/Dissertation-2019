Background: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus are considered to be important bacterial
species in the initiation of human dental caries. Therefore, the establishment of a reliable genotyping method
to distinguish S. mutans from S. sobrinus is of central importance.
Objective: We assessed the usefulness of repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction
(rep-PCR) using ERIC primer banding patterns in differentiating S. mutans and S. sobrinus.
Design: Five S. mutans and two S. sobrinus prototype strains and 50 clinical isolates (38 S. mutans serotype
c, 4 S. sobrinus serotype d, and 8 S. sobrinus serotype g) were examined. The banding patterns of amplicons
generated were compared among the prototype strains and clinical isolates, to find common bands that
distinguish S. mutans and S. sobrinus.
Results: Multiple banding patterns were seen with all strains tested. The representative strains of S. mutans
tested revealed six unique, strong bands at 2,000 bp, 1,700 bp, 1,400 bp, 1,100 bp, 850 bp, and 250 bp, whereas
S. sobrinus had seven strong bands at 2,000 bp, 1,800 bp, 1,100 bp, 900 bp, 800 bp, 600 bp, and 550 bp.
The band at 1,100 bp was the only band that was observed in both S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Furthermore,
most clinical S. mutans isolates revealed identical banding patterns. All S. mutans had amplicons at 1,700 bp,
850 bp, and 250 bp, whereas those of S. sobrinus were at 1,100 bp, 900 bp, and 800 bp.
Conclusions: These results indicate that using rep-PCR with the ERIC primers can distinguish between
S. mutans and S. sobrinus.

Dental caries is one of the most common world-

wide infectious diseases (1), and the principal
etiologic agents associated with developing in-
itial dental caries in human are Streptococcus mutans and
Streptococcus sobrinus (2). A variety of approaches for
clonal characterizations of S. mutans isolates has revealed
extensive genetic diversity (3, 4). Genotypic methods to
discriminate strains of bacteria include arbitrary primed
PCR, random amplified polymorphic DNA, pulsed field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and repetitive extragenic

palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). Among these, rep-PCR
has been found to be a useful, effective, and relatively low
cost method for discriminating and genotyping strains of
Escherichia coli (5, 6), Salmonella sp. (7, 8), Streptococcus
pneumonia (9, 10), and other bacterial species. Various
primers have been identified and commonly used for rep-
PCR such as the ERIC primers (5) that were developed
for E. coli, but due to the ubiquitous nature of repetitive
sequences, many are widely applicable to other species.
This easy and rapid method is based on repetitive

sequences within bacteria and is widely applied to
investigate taxonomy or epidemiology. However,
this
technology has not been vigorously applied to S. mutans
genotyping. A recent report showed that rep-PCR with
distinct a-hemolytic streptococci using (GTG)5 primer
was a fast and reliable method for identification of
S. mutans (11). Other studies have reported that rep-
PCR and PFGE result in similar conclusions (3). The
purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of
rep-PCR with ERIC primers to differentiate between
S. mutans and S. sobrinus using representative prototype
strains and clinical isolates.

Materials and methods

f

Bacterial strains
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Board of
Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo
(EC03-011). S. mutans serotype c (JC2, PS14, and
JCM5705), e (LM7),
(OMZ175), and S. sobrinus
serotype d (OMZ176 and B13), and g (GTC278 and
6715) were used as representative prototype strains and
were obtained from ATCC. Frozen (808C) stocks of
clinical isolates were stored by the Department of Oral
Microbiology at Nihon University School of Dentistry at
Matsudo. All clinical
isolates used in this study were
randomly selected from S. mutans serotype c, S. sobrinus
serotype d, and g (by serological tests) isolates obtained
from plaque samples using standard methodology.

DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated from cultures grown in 10 ml
of Brain Heart Infusion broth (Becton Dickson and
Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 378C in candle
jars for 24 hours, using a commercially available DNA
extraction kit (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, Qiagen, CA,
USA) and some modifications from the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, bacteria were harvested by centrifu-
gation, and then 180 ml of lysozyme (20 mg/ml of
lysozyme in 20 mM of TrisHCl) and 50 units of
mutanolysin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA)
were added, followed by overnight incubation at 378C to
lyse cells. The quality and quantity of DNA samples were
confirmed with a Nano Drop 1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 260/280 nm.
The concentration of extracted DNA was adjusted to
approximately 400 ng/ml and stored at308C until
analyzed.

Repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR
DNA was used to perform rep-PCR with ERIC primers
using the manufacturer’s protocol. The primer pair ERI
C1R (5?-ATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3?) and
ERIC 2 (5?-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3?)
was used. The reaction mixture contained 10 ml of buffer

components
(FailSafe PCR PreMix, EPICENTER
Technologies, Madison, WI, USA), 100 p mol of each
primer, 2.5 U of enzyme (FailSafe PCR Enzyme Mix,
EPICENTER Technologies, Madison, WI, USA), and
2 ml of DNA solution made up to 20 ml final volume. All
amplification reactions were conducted in a Gene Amp
9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Carsbad, CA,
USA). The initial denaturing temperature was 958C for
5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 958C for 3 min, 488C for
3 min, and 728C for 2 min, with a final extension at 728C
for 7 min.

(Agarose, USB, Cleveland, OH, USA)

Electrophoresis
Approximately 20 ml of the postamplification reactions
were separated by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose
in Tris
gel
BorateEDTA (TBE) buffer, stained with an ethidium
bromide solution (10 mg/ml), and photo documented under
UV light (Image Saver AE-6905C, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).
An optimized comparative study of the diversity of the
obtained banding patterns showed the presence or absence
of repetitive elements using photographic images.

Results

The differentiation of banding patterns between
S. mutans and S. sobrinus representative strains
The banding patterns obtained following rep-PCR of
S. mutans JC2, PS14, JCM5705, LM7, OMZ175, and
S. sobrinus OMZ176 and 6715 are shown in Fig. 1.
S. mutans rep-PCR resulted in amplicons with sizes that
ranged from 250 bp to 2,000 bp. S. mutans strains had six
strong bands at 2,000 bp, 1,700 bp, 1,400 bp, 1,100 bp,
850 bp, and 250 bp, except OMZ175 that was missing the
1,400 bp band. Additionally, with JCM5705, the band at
1,100 bp was weaker than that was seen with other
S. mutans strains. However, S. sobrinus had distinctly
different banding patterns when compared with the
S. mutans strains. S. sobrinus yielded seven bands at
2,000 bp, 1,800 bp, 1,100 bp, 900 bp, 800 bp, 600 bp,
and 550 bp, except OMZ176 that was missing the band at
2,000 bp (Fig. 1).

Comparisonofrep-PCRfingerprintbandingpatterns
from clinical isolates
Common banding patterns were observed within the S.
mutans clinical isolates (Fig. 2). Although the intensity of
banding varied, most clinical isolates had the six strong
bands that were seen with the representative strains (i.e.
2,000 bp, 1,700 bp, 1,400 bp, 1,100 bp, 850 bp, and 250
bp). The clinical isolates 1, 18, 23, 26, 27, and 31 were
missing the band at 2,000 bp, isolates 1, 2, 25, 28, 29, and
30 were missing the 1,100 bp band, and isolates 3, 10, 16,
20, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 38 were missing the 1,400
bp band. All the isolates had bands at 1,700 bp, 850 bp,

and 250 bp. Figure 3 shows the patterns from S. sobrinus
serotype d and g clinical isolates. Isolates 4 and 9 were
missing the 550 bp band. Isolates 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15
were missing the bands at 600 bp and 550 bp. All the
isolates had bands at 1,100 bp, 900 bp, and 800 bp.

Discussion
S. mutans and S. sobrinus are members of the mutans
streptococci (MS). Although there are seven serotypes
that compose the MS, S. mutans (serotypes c, e, and f)
and S. sobrinus (serotypes d and g) are the only MS that
have been found in humans (4). Therefore, a technique
that can easily distinguish S. sobrinus from S.mutans
would be useful for analysis of human oral samples.

In the process of examining the feasibility of an easy
and reliable rep-PCR genotyping system for S. mutans,
we used the common ERIC primers. Before we per-
formed rep-PCR using ERIC primers, six different
primers sets, i.e. BOX, ERIC, SERA, REP, M13, and
(GTG)5 primers, (Hokkaido system science, Sapporo,
Hokkaido, Japan), enzyme, and buffer components
(EPICENTER Technologies, TOYOBO, Promega, Ta-
kara and others) were screened for rep-PCR results using
the manufacturer’s protocol. The BOX primers were
designed for not only analysis of S. pneumoniae strains
but also to amplify a small number of bands from S.
mutans, but not other oral streptococci (9). However, we
did not observe any S. mutans PCR amplicons with BOX
or REP primers (data not shown). Alam et al. compared
ERIC, SERA, and REP primers with oral streptococci
but did not evaluate S. mutans. They concluded that there

was no evidence of banding patterns or individual bands
among a-hemolytic streptococci (4). Sˇ vec et al. investi-
gated rep-PCR using (GTG)5 primer for S. mutans and
observed banding patterns. They concluded that using
(GTG)5 primer is one of the reliable methods for strain
typing of S. mutans (11). However, we were not able to
reproduce their findings using (GTG)5, SERE, and M13
primers (data not shown). ERIC primers have been used
for molecular-typing studies and clonal discriminations
with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (6).
Indeed, there is no report that investigates S. mutans with
rep-PCR using ERIC primers.

We examined S. mutans and S. sobrinus representative
strains and serotype c, d, and g clinical isolates that are
the most common serotypes in human decay (1) by rep-
PCR using ERIC primers. Six strong bands at 2,000 bp,
1,700 bp, 1,400 bp, 1,100 bp, 850 bp, and 250 bp were
observed in all S. mutans serotype c and e representative
strains and clinical isolates, with some exception (Figs 1
and 2). The serotype f strain lacked the 1,400 bp band.
Some S. mutans clinical isolates lacked a band at 2,000
bp, 1,400 bp, or 1,100 bp. All isolates and representative
strains of S. mutans had bands at 1,700 bp, 850 bp, and
250 bp that might be specific bands for identification of
S. mutans. Differentiation of S. mutans serotypes by rep-
PCR using ERIC primers is at present not completely
resolved, especially because serotype f representative
strains were more variable than the other prototype
strains evaluated. A clear differentiation of prototype
strains and clinical isolates based on consistent specific
banding patterns is necessary to validate this approach in

specific differentiation. On the other hand, S. sobrinus,
except OMZ176, had seven strong bands at 2,000 bp,
1,800 bp, 1,100 bp, 900 bp, 800 bp, 600 bp, and 550 bp.
Almost all S. sobrinus clinical isolates had amplicons at
1,100 bp, 900 bp, and 800 bp. Therefore, the bands at
1,100 bp, 900 bp, and 800 bp could be the focus for
differentiating between S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Among
these bands, the band at 1,100 bp may be a common band
for S. mutans and S. sobrinus. The results presented
herein are from a method that was found to be most
optimal for obtaining bands from amplicons generated
with ERIC primers from S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Other
primer sets concentrations of enzyme components and
thermal cycles conditions were evaluated in effort to
obtain the results presented (data not shown).

Compared with PFGE or multiple locus sequence
typing, rep-PCR has less-defined results; however, we
found that compared to other methods, rep-PCR with
ERIC primers was able to differentiate representative as
well as clinical S. mutans and S. sobrinus isolates. Due to
a lack of serotype e, f, and non-streptococci clinical
isolates, we were unable to analyze their banding patterns.
Further studies to evaluate the banding patterns of these
serotypes for comparison will follow. Using computer
software to obtain dendrograms might be a more efficient
and reproducible method to identify banding patterns of
strains within these two species. Even though we did not
use computer software to make dendrograms, we were
able to distinguish between S. mutans and S. sobrinus.
More detailed experimental research will be necessary to
analyze the sequences of primers that obtain the strongest
bands.

The slight difference in banding pattern sometimes
seen with the same extracted DNA, ERIC primers,
buffer, and enzyme amplifications may be due to the
low specificity of primers, not only the ERIC but also
other rep-PCR primers. Nevertheless, this technique is
able to distinguish S. mutans from S. sobrinus. Thus, the
demonstrated presence or absence of particular repetitive
elements will be useful
in genotyping S. mutans and
S. sobrinus.
