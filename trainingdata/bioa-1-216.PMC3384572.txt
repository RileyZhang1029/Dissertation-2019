A matter of phosphorylation?

Early morphogenic movements are

an important feature of embryo-
nic development in vertebrates. During
zebrafish gastrulation, epiboly progres-
sion is driven by the coordinated remo-
deling of the YSL microtubule network
and F-actin cables. We recently described
the implication of Nrz, an anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 homolog, in the control of the YSL
cytoskeleton dynamics. Nrz knock-down
induces premature actin-myosin ring for-
mation leading to margin constriction,
epiboly arrest and embryo lethality. At
the molecular level, the Nrz protein con-
trols the actin-myosin dynamics through
IP3R-dependent calcium levels variation.
Here, we discuss these novel
findings
and propose a model in which reversible
phosphorylation of the Nrz/IP3R com-
plex modulates the permeability of the
IP3R calcium channel and thus may
explain the Nrz-dependent control of
IP3R opening required for proper epiboly
completion.

Early embryonic development is a complex
process requiring highly coordinated sig-
nals to shape the embryo and set up the
body plan of the future adult. During
zebrafish gastrulation, a series of cell rear-
rangements and movements result in the
formation of the three germ layers (the
endoderm, the ectoderm and the meso-
derm) as well as the dorsoventral and
anteroposterior axes. The first morphoge-
netic movement of gastrulation, known
as epiboly, begins just at the end of the
blastula period.1 At this time, the embryo
is organized into three cell
the
enveloping cell layer (EVL) and the deep
cell layer (DCL) forming the blastoderm,

layers;

which is layed on top of the yolk syncitial
layer (YSL) (Fig. 1). This latter layer is
formed during blastula period when the
blastomeres
in contact with the yolk
release their entire content in the yolk
cell. Epiboly is characterized by the migra-
tion of the blastoderm from the animal
pole down to the vegetal pole. This pro-
cess can be divided into three phases:
initiation, progression and completion.2
During the initiation phase, part of the
YSL spreads beneath the blastoderm
forming the internal-YSL (I-YSL) while
the other part of
the YSL, called the
external-YSL (E-YSL), forms a ring under
the EVL. As the yolk spreads toward the
animal pole,
the blastoderm thins out
and the DCL moves radially outward to
eventually form a cap of cells over the
yolk. Once this so-called dome stage is
reached,
this
phase, the blastoderm continues to grow
thinner and all three layers migrate co-
ordinately toward the vegetal pole until
they reach the equator of
the embryo
(50% epiboly). At this point, the DCL
migration pauses, allowing other gastrula-
tion movements to begin while EVL and
E-YSL migration continues. Finally, the
EVL keeps on moving until the entire
yolk cell is covered.

epiboly begins. During

The molecular mechanisms underlying
epiboly are still under debate but it seems
that cytoskeleton dynamics plays a crucial
role in this process. Indeed, it was shown
that the yolk cell harbors a large number of
microtubules, which play a central role in
epiboly initiation and progression. These
microtubules are organized in a dense
network in the YSL from which parallel
arrays of microtubules extend toward the
vegetal pole of the yolk cell (Fig. 1). This

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the epiboly progression during early zebrafish development. During epiboly, the blastomeres migrate toward the
vegetal pole to envelope the yolk cell. This morphogenic movement is orchestrated by the coordinate changes in the yolk syncitial layer (YSL)
cytoskeleton mainly composed of microtubules and F-actin cables. Parallel microtubule meshwork originating from the yolk syncitial nuclei (YSN) are
extending toward the vegetal embryo pole, and participates actively in the epiboly progression. The margin actin-myosin ring formed at 75% epiboly is
important for the completion of the epiboly. EVL, enveloping layer; DCL, deep cell layer.

latter network grows shorter as epiboly
progresses; it should be noted that when it
is disrupted, YSL migration stops while
EVL and DCL migration slows down,
suggesting that YSL microtubules drive, at
least in part, epiboly progression.

in the

The actin cytoskeleton also seems to be
implicated in epiboly movements. Indeed,
during gastrulation, a distinct actin-based
structure, called the actin-myosin ring,
forms at the interface of the EVL and the
E-YSL around 75% epiboly (Fig. 1). This
actin-myosin ring was first proposed to
participate
the
margin which ensures blastopore closure
at the end of epiboly.3 More recently, it
was shown that the actin-myosin ring can
also contract earlier during epiboly. It was
thus proposed that this contraction may
be involved in changing the shape of the
adjacent EVL cells and reducing the
circumference of the margin in motion
to fit the shape of the yolk cell.4

contraction of

The mechanisms underlying the con-
traction of the actin-myosin ring are still
under investigation. Köppen and collea-
gues
showed that Msn1, a Ste20-like
kinase, participates in the recruitment of
actin and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2)
in the YSL and promotes actin ring con-
traction.4 Calcium may be another key
regulator of actin ring contraction. Indeed,
two different studies report that after 50%

epiboly, high calcium levels are transiently
observed at the margin of the blastoderm
from which the actin ring originates.5,6
This model of
calcium-induced actin
contraction is corroborated by the fact
that calcium chelation inhibits actin ring
formation.3 Furthermore,
it was shown
that a mutation in MAPKAPK2 is asso-
ciated with premature ring contraction
and ectopic calcium levels increase in the
blastoderm.7 Finally, we recently demon-
the knock-down of nrz, a
strated that
member of the bcl-2 family of apoptosis
inhibitors, induces similar premature actin
ring contraction.8 Indeed, we showed that
this contraction is triggered by increased
calcium levels at the margin between the
blastoderm and the YSL. In this particular
situation, calcium presumably activates
the calcium-dependent protein calmodulin
which in turns may activates the myosin
light chain kinase (MLCK)
leading to
increased myosin phosphorylation and
subsequent
contraction.
Interestingly, during epiboly, Nrz expres-
sion is restricted to the YSL which con-
tains significant amount of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. In fact,
Nrz is
located to both organelles; of
note, at the ER, Nrz interacts with the
Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1
(IP3R1) thus regulating calcium release
through this channel. These results reveal

actin-myosin

that by interacting with IP3R1, Nrz con-
trols calcium fluxes inside the YSL and
regulates actin-myosin ring formation dur-
ing epiboly. Together, the above studies
point out to the critical role of calcium
signaling in the dynamics of the actin
cytoskeleton during epiboly progression.
How calcium signaling is regulated during
epiboly remains an open question. Indeed,
calcium is a versatile messenger requiring
to be finely tuned as excess or lack of
calcium is detrimental for the developing
embryo. As a matter of fact, an underly-
ing regulatory mechanism may be based
on the interaction between Nrz and IP3R1
in the YSL.

Of note, Nrz is present as soon as the
YSL forms and its expression increases as
epiboly progresses. We can thus assume
that before 50% epiboly, Nrz strongly
interacts with IP3R1 in the YSL thus
preventing abnormal calcium release from
the ER and inhibiting premature actin ring
formation. However, around 60% epiboly,
calcium transients begin originating from
the margin of the migrating blastoderm. It
is still unclear if these transients originate
from the blastomeres or the YSL but we
can assume that at least some of them
come from the YSL as the actin-myosin
ring is localized at the interface of the EVL
and the YSL. Thus at
the
interactions between Nrz and IP3R are

calcium fluxes in the YSL.

calcium release

from the ER, but

To confirm this hypothesis it appears
critical to determine how Nrz interacts
with IP3R1 and regulates calcium release
from the ER. Indeed, until now several
studies have pointed out to a role of the
Bcl-2 proteins on IP3R-dependent cal-
cium release
the
underlying mechanism is still a matter of
intense debate. The members of the Bcl-2
family, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, were
shown to interact with IP3R and decrease
calcium release from the ER; however,
this
while according to certain studies
might be the consequence of
increased
calcium leakage thus reducing ER calcium
content,9,10 other reports support direct
inhibition of
through
IP3R.11 Our data indicate that
in the
zebrafish embryo, Nrz seems to directly
inhibit
IP3R-dependent calcium release
since nrz knock-down significantly increa-
ses cytosolic calcium levels whereas treat-
ment of nrz-invalidated embryos with
IP3R inhibitors restores normal develop-
ment. To further understand how Nrz
inhibits IP3R-dependent calcium release
it is required to determine which domain
of Nrz interacts with IP3R1. It should be
noted that Bcl-2 interacts with IP3R1 via
its BH4 (Bcl-2 homology 4) domain;
moreover, this domain alone is able to
inhibit calcium release through IP3R1. In
contrast, the BH4 domain of Bcl-XL does
not affect IP3R1 permeability,12 suggest-
ing that additional BH domains pre-
sumably participate to the regulation of
IP3R-dependent calcium release. Actually,
the BH4 domain is the less conserved
domain among the Bcl-2 family;
thus,
due to this variability, the BH4 domain
of some Bcl-2 family members may be
unable to bind IP3R1 or regulate channel
opening. Our results indicate that Nrz
binds
this
domain is essential for Nrz-induced inhibi-
tion of IP3R1. However whether the Nrz
BH4 domain alone can inhibit calcium
release through IP3R1 is not known.

IP3R1 via BH4 and that

In the same line, the Nrz binding site
within IP3R1 remains to be characterized.
So far, the characterization of the inter-
action domains between the Bcl-2 family
members and IP3R is still a highly con-
troversial
and

issue. Recently, White

colleagues reported that the Bcl-2 binding
site would be located at the C-terminus
of IP3R,13 while in contrast the team of
Distelhorst proposed this binding site to
be in the modulatory domain of IP3R,
right in the middle of the protein.14 Inter-
estingly, both groups agree that Bcl-2
members do not interact with the inosi-
tol 1,4,5-triphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] bind-
ing domain suggesting that they do not
compete for the interaction of the ligand
with IP3R. There is no doubt that remov-
ing this kind of ambiguity is a prerequisite
to understand the regulation of Nrz/IP3R
interactions. Indeed, a number of regula-
tory binding partners of IP3R have been
identified,15,16 and, depending on the
location of the Nrz binding site(s) within
the IP3R subunits, different proteins are
expected to affect this interaction and the
opening of the calcium channel. Inhibi-
tion or activation of
IP3R by direct
interaction have been seldom described,
indeed the most common regulation of
IP3R calcium permeability appears
to
occur via phosphorylation or dephospho-
rylation mechanisms.

including zebrafish.

So far numerous protein kinases or
phosphatases were described to interact
with IP3R and to regulate its opening via
phosphorylation or dephosphorylation at
specific sites which are well conserved
among species
In
general, phosphorylation of IP3R is asso-
ciated with its activation and it has been
shown that Bcl-2 modulates the phospho-
rylation status of IP3R. Indeed,
it was
reported that Bcl-2 can directly interact
with calcineurin,17 a calcium/calmodulin-
dependent phosphatase known to depho-
sphorylate IP3R.18 In this latter study,
the
calcineurin
specifically regulates the increased IP3R-
dependent calcium release induced by
protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation
of IP3R. Thus, by recruiting calcineurin,
Bcl-2 may trigger IP3R dephosphorylation
and control the IP3R-dependent calcium
release. Interestingly, it should be noted
that Bcl-2 could also be phosphorylated
by several kinases including PKC which
phosphorylate Bcl-2 at Ser70, a residue
located in an unstructured loop at the
N-terminus of the protein between the
BH4 and BH3 domains.19 Bcl-2 phos-

residues in this loop is associated to its
inactivation since mutation of these phos-

effect of Bcl-2.20,21 More interestingly, a
non-phosphorylatable form of Bcl-2 was
shown to be more efficient to decrease
calcium release through IP3R compared
with native Bcl-2.22 In addition, as Bcl-2
interacts with calcineurin,
the PKC-
dependent phosphorylation should be
reversibly

it should be noted that
Nrz also harbors an unstructured loop
between its BH4 and BH3 domains and
that this loop contains two serine residues
and one threonine residue as Bcl-2, it can
thus be speculated that similar phosphor-
ylation may occur in Nrz too.

Considering these data, we built a
model for the control of IP3R1/Nrz inter-
actions by reversible phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation (Fig. 2). According to
this model, before the embryo reaches
50% epiboly, Nrz interacts with IP3R1
and keeps the channel in closed-state by
an unknown mechanism possibly medi-
ated by a phosphatase, such as calcineurin,
or by direct inhibition via the interaction
of Nrz with IP3R regulatory domain.
Then, after the migrating cells crossed
the equator, a signal is expected to origi-
nate from the embryo to trigger calcium
transients and subsequent
formation of
contractible actin rings. This signal pre-
sumably activates phospholipase C (PLC),
generating Ins(1,4,5)P3,
the ligand of
IP3R, and diacylglycerol (DAG) which in
turn activates PKC.23 Activated PKC may
then phosphorylate both Nrz and IP3R1,
thus resulting in Nrz loss of function and
subsequent activation of
IP3R1 which
allows calcium release from the ER upon
Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding.
the
PKC-dependent phosphorylation of IP3R
is inhibited by calcium,24 consequently the
maintenance of low levels of calcium in
the YSL due to Nrz interaction with IP3R
should promote phosphorylation of the
channel. Finally, calcium release may, on
the one hand, activate calmodulin which
is consequently prone to interact with
MLCK and promote MLC2 phosphoryla-
tion,
inducing actin-myosin ring
contraction. On the other hand, calcium
and calmodulin may activate calcineurin
which could in turn dephosphorylate both

back loop may be of major importance
during epiboly since abnormal calcium
levels in the YSL may induce unwanted
actin ring contraction leading to the
detachment of the bastoderm from the
yolk and thus death of the embryo.

In conclusion, there is a growing body
of evidence that epiboly and subsequent
gastrulation stages are driven, at least in

part, by calcium signaling and the activity
of IP3R. Thus this channel, which is at
the crossroads of a number of kinase-
dependent pathways appear to be a key
integrator of the various signals upstream
of these pathways, ensuring precise time
and space dependent progression of epi-
boly via the fine tuning of calcium trans-
ients throughout the embryo. Here we
propose that
reversible phosphorylation
of the Nrz/IP3R complex is critical for

proper calcium signaling and subsequent
actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the deve-
loping embryo. According to this model a
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation loop
may be implicated in generating tempor-
ally controlled calcium transients and
actin-myosin ring contraction, which drive
epiboly progression.
this
hypothesis may give new insights into
calcium signaling and cytoskeleton dyn-
amics during early zebrafish development.
