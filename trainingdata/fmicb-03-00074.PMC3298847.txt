Since the ﬁrst description of dendritic cells (DCs) by Steinman and Cohn (1973), the myeloid
lineage of leukocytes was investigated intensively. Nowadays it is obvious that myeloid
cells, especially DCs, are crucial for the adaptive and innate immune response against
intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania major parasites. Based on the overlapping
expression of molecules that were commonly used to classify myeloid cells, it becomes
difﬁcult to denominate those cell types precisely. Of note, most of these markers used
for myeloid cell identiﬁcation are expressed on a broad range of myeloid cells, and should
therefore be handled with care if used for subtyping of myeloid cells. In this mini-review
we aim to discuss the relative impact of DCs that release TNF and nitric oxide (Tip-DCs)
and myeloid cells with suppressive capacities (myeloid-derived suppressor cells, MDSCs)
in infectious diseases such as experimental leishmaniasis. In our point of view it cannot
be excluded that the novel subsets that were denominated as “Tip-DCs” and “MDSCs”
might not be classical “subsets” but rather represent myeloid cells in a transient maturation
stage expressing different genes, in response to the surrounding environment.

INTRODUCTION
Based on co-evolutionary processes pathogens have developed
escape mechanisms to avoid rapid elimination by host-derived
components of the immune system such as antimicrobial peptides
and phagocytes. Especially the vector-borne parasites Leishmania
(L.) major established efﬁcient methods to have a lead over the
host defense mechanism: they hide and replicate within host cells
(Olivier et al., 2005). Most of the host cells for Leishmania parasites
belong to the mononuclear phagocyte system that is divided into
(i) differentiated macrophages, (ii) dendritic cells (DCs), and (iii)
monocytes (Ritter et al., 2009; Yona and Jung, 2010). In addition,
it is documented that neutrophils can harbor L. major parasites
as well (Ritter et al., 2009). However, the number of such skin-
resident host cells is limited. Given that limitation, a recruitment
of additional host cells is pivotal for subsequent replication and
spreading of the parasites (Ritter et al., 1996; Dupasquier et al.,
2004). It appears somehow paradox that those innate defense
mechanisms that are characterized by a massive inﬂammation
process and attraction of further myeloid cells to the site of infec-
tion, give the parasites an advantage: the parasites expand within
that recruited host cells.

The procedures involved in extravasation of myeloid cells from
the blood stream to the site of infection are complex (Imhof and
Aurrand-Lions, 2004) and will not be discussed in detail in this
review due to space limitation. Nevertheless, it is important to
mention that a broad spectrum of myeloid cells express adhesion
molecules such as αMβ2-integrin (also known as CD11b–CD18)

and αxβ2-integrin (also known as CD11c–CD18) that are involved
in those homing processes (Imhof and Aurrand-Lions, 2004).
Thus, it might be possible that a heterogeneous pool of differ-
ent myeloid subsets is recruited to the inﬂamed tissue by similar
mechanisms (Imhof and Aurrand-Lions, 2004; Leon and Ardavin,
2008). Once placed within the dermal compartment neutrophils
and macrophages can release chemokines and pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines, which in turn attract additional myeloid-derived host
cells for further infection (Ritter and Korner, 2002; Peters et al.,
2008).

It is commonly accepted that terminally differentiated myeloid
cells fulﬁll controversial functions in infectious diseases such as
leishmaniasis: macrophages are crucial for parasite replication and
parasite elimination (after appropriate activation), DCs are bridg-
ing the innate and adaptive immune response and infected neu-
trophils can be taken up by macrophages resulting in a pronounced
replication of parasites (Bogdan and Rollinghoff, 1998; Bogdan
et al., 2000). However, those “classical” myeloid cells, denomi-
nated as “macrophage” or “DC,” have been further subdivided
into distinct subsets according to certain cluster of differentiation
(CD)-patterns and the additional expression of additive molecules
and cytokines. Based on that multi-parameter analysis it became
difﬁcult to precisely appoint distinct myeloid cell subsets (Table 1).
Furthermore, it is obvious that such ex vivo or in situ characteri-
zation of a myeloid cell, represents one distinct snapshot in their
life span. Thus, it is feasible that the identiﬁed phenotypes do
not obligatory represent “myeloid subsets” but rather represent a
transient stage in the life of these cells – inﬂuenced by the local
environmental conditions.

In the following section we will discuss myeloid cells commonly

known as “TIP-DCs” and “MDSCs” in more detail.

Myeloid cell plasticity in infectious diseases

TNF/iNOS PRODUCING DCs: TIP-DCs
In 1957 it was postulated that lymphocytes proliferate in response
to antigens that matches their receptor (Burnet, 1976). Steinman
and Cohn identiﬁed a novel cell type – denominated as DCs – that
was discussed to be involved in presentation of antigens and sub-
sequent T cell proliferation in 1973 (Steinman and Cohn, 1973;
Katsnelson, 2006). Today it is a paradigm that DCs play a pivotal
role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity and consequently
in T cell priming. However, the characterization of distinct surface
markers (e.g., CD11c, CD11b, CD4, CD8), revealed the diversity
of the DCs (Table 1).

Dendritic cell differentiation can start with the stage of a com-
mon macrophage-DC progenitor (MDP) that has been described
−
to be Lin
(Fogg et al., 2006).
Those MDPs further differentiate into common DC progenitors
(CDP) that in turn evolve to non-conventional plasmacytoid DCs
(pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs; Fogg et al., 2006). Alterna-
tively, DC maturation might occur from monocyte intermediate
precursors (Fogg et al., 2006). The precursor of skin-associated
DCs, such as epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), is controversially
discussed. There are data indicating that LCs and most likely
dermal DCs (dDCs) are of myeloid origin with a monocytic
intermediate (Palucka and Banchereau, 2006). However, other
authors argue that LCs descent from fetal progenitor and belong to
“..macrophages of the central nerve system..” (Auffray et al., 2009).
Despite these developmental differences, most of the mentioned
DC subsets renew under steady state conditions in lymphoid and
non-lymphoid organs (Fogg et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Waskow
et al., 2008; Auffray et al., 2009).

Why is it essential to contemplate DC differentiation and prog-
enitor options? Because infectious diseases, such as cutaneous
leishmaniasis, are characterized by a massive turn over of myeloid
cells – including immature DC precursors – at the site of infec-
tion. Thus, it is difﬁcult to denominate a terminally differentiated
DC subset correctly that might be involved in an immunologi-
cal process in vivo. The changing view in the classiﬁcation of LCs
in experimental leishmaniasis represents a good example under-
lining the difﬁculties to dedicate the right function. In 1992 it
was proposed that LCs are involved in inducing the local immune
response against L. major parasites (Will et al., 1992). Twelve years
later, based on the possibility for LC depletion, authors described a
novel subset of a dermal DC (dDC) which were responsible for the
induction of protective T helper (Th) 1 response in leishmaniasis
whereas LCs were priming self-regulatory T cells (IL-10 produc-
ing type 1 regulatory T cells; Tr1 cells) and Tregs (Moreno, 2007;
Brewig et al., 2009; Kautz-Neu et al., 2011).

A novel DC subset was introduced into the ﬁeld in 2004
+

(Serbina et al., 2003). Those DCs (CD11bint CD11cint Gr-1
DEC-205
) were shown to produce TNF and
iNOS/NO during Listeria (L.) monocytogenes infection (Serbina
et al., 2003). Due to the fact that the presented DCs produce high
levels of co-stimulatory molecules, prime alloreactive T cells, do
not adhere, and have a DC-like morphology, these TNF/iNOS
producing DCs were denominated Tip-DCs (Serbina et al., 2003).
Considering that TNF (Virna et al., 2006) and iNOS expression
(MacMicking et al., 1997) are pivotal for the control of L. mono-
cytogenes, the authors concluded that Tip-DCs are crucial for

antimicrobial defense. The accumulation of Tip-DCs in the liver
was also detected in mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei, an
extracellular blood-borne parasite that can cause sleeping sickness
in humans (Bosschaerts et al., 2010). Based on their ﬁndings, the
authors concluded that TNF released by Tip-DC is responsible for
severe liver injury in trypanosomiasis (Bosschaerts et al., 2010).
Thus, the presence of Tip-DCs in inﬂamed tissues can be either
beneﬁcial or destructive.

To review the relevance of Tip-DCs in experimental leishma-
niasis, it is important to highlight the potential precursor of those
cells and the factors that are involved in Tip-DC differentiation.
As indicated above, Tip-DCs can be stained with the mAb RB6-
8C5 (granulocyte-differentiation antigen/Gr-1). Notably, the mAb
RB6-8C5 detects the lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G and
C (Ly6G and Ly6C; Ritter et al., 2009). Thus Tip-DCs can be pos-
itive for Ly6C and/or Ly6G, which are known to be expressed on
immature monocytes, DCs, and neutrophils (Table 1; Lutz et al.,
1999; Sunderkotter et al., 2004; Ritter et al., 2009).

+

In the murine infection model for T. brucei described by
+
Bosschaerts et al. (2010), CCR2
inﬂammatory monocytic cells
derived from CD11b and Ly6C expressing cells were discussed
to represent the precursor of liver Tip-DCs. In their experimen-
tal model, the differentiation to Tip-DCs from immature DCs
but CD80/CD86/MHC-class IIlow) is independent of
(CD11c
IFN-γ and MyD88 signaling, whereas IFN-γ stimulation is neces-
sary for TNF and iNOS/NO production (Bosschaerts et al., 2010).
Based on the facts mentioned above, it is obvious that TiP-DCs
Ly6Chigh (Serbina and Pamer, 2006)
can derive from CCR2
macrophage/DC progenitor (MDP) cells and have the potential
to produce TNF/NO after appropriate stimulation.

+

+

, F4/80

In general the production of iNOS and TNF can be induced in
different DC populations after appropriate stimulation (Munder
+
et al., 1999). For instance, bone marrow-derived DCs (CD11c
,
CD11b
) are known to produce TNF (Ritter et al., 2003)
and iNOS (Wilkins-Rodriguez et al., 2010) after stimulation (Lu
et al., 1996) and are positive for CCR2 (Jimenez et al., 2010). The
only DC subset known so far that does not produce iNOS and TNF
+
in parallel are pDCs (CD11b
,
CD62L
Colonna et al., 2004; Schleicher et al.,
2007) and eventually epidermal LCs (Langerin
; Blank
et al., 1996). Thus, it is difﬁcult to see the dissimilarity of TiP-DCs
and other activated monocyte-derived cells (Taylor et al., 2005;
Hume, 2008). In other words it cannot be excluded that TiP-DCs
do not represent a distinct DC subset but rather belong to com-
mon monocyte-derived DC responding to their environment with
TNF/NO production (Serbina et al., 2003).

Nevertheless, the molecules TNF and iNOS expressed by Tip-
DCs, are substantial for the host defense against the obligatory
intracellular pathogen L. major (Diefenbach et al., 1998; Wilhelm
et al., 2001). Additionally, it was shown that Tip-DCs also release
IFN-β that is known to promote healing of leishmaniasis (Mattner
et al., 2004; Dresing et al., 2010; Solodova et al., 2011). There are
very limited data published demonstrating the existence of iNOS
producing DCs in experimental leishmaniasis (Leon et al., 2007).
Furthermore, only a minor population of DCs in skin-draining
lymph nodes (SDLNs; <2%) could be assigned to the phenotype
of “Tip-DCs” (De Trez et al., 2009).

Myeloid cell plasticity in infectious diseases

Summarizing published reports so far, we assume the follow-
ing hypothetical scenario for the role of Tip-DCs in experimen-
tal leishmaniasis. Here, we focused on the early phase (parasite
replication, innate immune response) and the intermediate phase
(parasite control, adaptive immune response).

EARLY AFTER INFECTION
Skin-resident macrophages and/or neutrophils get infected with
promastigote Leishmania parasites after intra dermal inoculation
(Peters et al., 2008). Thereafter, macrophages release TNF and the
chemokine CCL2 after engulfment of the parasites (Ritter and
Moll, 2000; Wenzel et al., 2011). These inﬂammatory mediators
+
are important for the subsequent recruitment of other CCR2
myeloid cells such as monocytes and/or DC precursors (Leon et al.,
2007; Ritter et al., 2008). Remarkably, it was shown that the expres-
sion of IFN-γ at the site of infection increases rapidly, very short
after s.c. infection (Liese et al., 2007; Ritter et al., 2008). Conse-
quently, the recruited monocytes and DC precursor are exposed
to an inﬂammatory environment (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF, CCL2) that
might be responsible for the subsequent induction of iNOS and
TNF production in monocyte-derived DCs: the phenotype of a
“Tip-DCs” is induced (De Trez et al., 2009).

The expression of iNOS results in an accumulation of NO in
the surrounding of the cell. Given the fact that NO exposure to
DCs induces their apoptosis and NO exposure to T cells blocks T
cell IFN-γ production, NO represents a central molecule involved
in suppression of the T cell response (Lu et al., 1996; Ren et al.,
2008). Serbina et al. (2003) reported that Tip-DCs are not essential
for T cell priming in mice infected with L. monocytogenes. Other
data show that human Tip-DCs can prime naïve T cells toward
Th1 cells in vitro (Chong et al., 2011). Thus, NO-releasing Tip-
DCs might play a minor role in the expansion of antigen-speciﬁc
T cells in SDLNs but might be involved in polarizing naïve T cells.
In our notion, TiP-DCs are involved in controlling para-
site replication at the site of infection based on the expression
of the leishmanicidal molecule NO and the maintenance of
TNF-induced inﬂammation.

INTERMEDIATE PHASE
The T cell response is induced in SDLNs of infected mice within
1 week after infection (Brewig et al., 2009). However, it is not clear
whether DCs or TiP-DCs that were recruited to the site of infection,
are responsible/capable for the transfer of living parasites from the
side of infection into the SDLNs (Kaye and Scott, 2011). Possibly,
TiP-DCs might remain within the dermal compartment, whereas
Th1-driving dDCs capture already fragmentized parasite-particles
for subsequent processing (Ritter and Osterloh, 2007; Brewig et al.,
2009). Keeping in mind that especially mature DC (CCR7high,
CD40high) show the tendency to migrate to the SDLNs (Ritter
et al., 2003, 2008) it is plausible that the TNF released by Tip-
DCs might therefore potentiate the maturation and subsequent
migration of Th1-driving dDCs to the SDLNs.
CD11b+/Gr-1+ MYELOID-DERIVED CELLS: SUPPRESSOR OR
EFFECTOR CELLS?
Ongoing immune reactions against pathogens are often associ-
ated with severe tissue damage. Thus, dampening mechanisms

are important to narrow that severe side effect. However, such
counter-regulating procedures must be well balanced to avoid lim-
itations in host defense and subsequent spreading of the parasites
over the entire organism.

Besides the lymphocytic population of regulatory T cells (Tregs),
myeloid cells with suppressive functions were described in 1984/85
and referred as “natural suppressor cells” (Strober, 1984; Sakaguchi,
2011). During the last decades myeloid cells with suppressive
capacities were rediscovered in the ﬁeld of oncology (Gabrilovich
and Nagaraj, 2009). Those cells – denominated as myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) – represent a heterogeneous cell popu-
lation that stains for CD11b and Gr-1 (Ly6G–Ly6C). Using anti-
bodies speciﬁc for Ly6C and Ly6G, MDSCs were further dissected

This further differentiation between sub-groups is helpful.
However, the markers used for the classiﬁcation of MDSCs
(CD11b, Ly6G, and Ly6C) are not exclusively restricted to MDSCs.
Myeloid progenitor cells and immature myeloid cells such as
macrophages, granulocytes, and DC subsets are known to express
the surface molecules as well (Table 1). Additionally, it is not
clear whether all characteristics of tumor-associated MDSCs can
be transferred to infected tissues that eventually show differ-
ent cytokine expression patterns. Nevertheless, the appearance of
myeloid cells showing a MDSC phenotype during inﬂammation
processes have been described in different infection models such
as Candida albicans (Mencacci et al., 2002), Porphyromonas gingi-
valis (Ezernitchi et al., 2006), and L. monocytogenes (Sunderkotter
et al., 2004).

Those inﬂammatory myeloid cells might not necessarily have
the adjudicated suppressive function of a “MDSC.” There-
fore, the potential suppressive capacity of MDSCs was ana-
lyzed in in vitro assays. This data revealed that NO-secretion
of immature Ly6G
myeloid cells can suppress the
proliferation of cells isolated from the lymph node in infec-
tion models such as experimental leishmaniasis (Pereira et al.,
2011) and trypanosomiasis (Goni et al., 2002). It is believed
that immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs requires cell–cell
contact (Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009). Consequently, cell-
surface receptors and/or released short-lived soluble media-
tors might
the target cell. Fur-
thermore, MDSC participate in the suppression of ongo-
ing immune reactions by the expansion of
regulatory T
cells (Huang et al., 2006; Seraﬁni et al., 2008). The mech-
anisms of MDSC mediated suppression are summarized in
Table 2.

induce the suppression of

Some data indicate that MDSC mediated suppression of T cells
is antigen-independent (Kusmartsev et al., 2000; Watanabe et al.,
2008). Based on the fact that antigen-speciﬁc interactions between
antigen-presenting cells and antigen-speciﬁc T cells prolong the
antigen-speciﬁc cell–cell contact, it is most likely that MDSC-
derived suppressive factors are more efﬁcient on closed by antigen-
speciﬁc T cells than on the surrounding antigen-independent T
cells (Stoll et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2004; Nagaraj et al., 2007).
However, this important aspect needs to be further investigated in
the future.

Besides the in vitro studies, the inhibitory function and rele-
vance of MDSCs in vivo is not well documented so far. Based on
the data generated in experimental leishmaniasis it further remains
unclear, which phase and tissue MDSCs might interfere with T
cell activation in vivo. It is conceivable that MDSCs are involved
in the elimination of the parasites and the suppression of T cell
proliferation as well. Summarizing published reports so far, we
assume the following hypothetical scenario for the role of MDSCs
experimental leishmaniasis.

To avoid too many speculations we focused on the potential role
of MDSCs in the early phase (parasite replication, innate immune
response) and the intermediate phase (parasite control, adaptive
immune response).

+

INITIAL PHASE
Ly6Cmed-high monocytes (Sunderkotter et al., 2004) share
CD11b
homing receptors crucial for the extravasation from the blood to
the infected tissue. Thus it is most likely that a pool of MDSCs cells
is recruited to the site of infection. In this area immature myeloid
cells get in contact with cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, CCL2, IL-10, IL-
12, IL-13, IL-4, IFN-γ, TGF-β) that drive MDSC differentiation
(for further reading; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009). Of note,
IFN-γ and CCL2 are detectable shortly after infection or after
phagocyte–parasite interactions (Ritter and Moll, 2000; Schleicher
+
Ly6Cmed-high myeloid cells
et al., 2007). Thus, immature CD11b
can become MDSCs as a response to their inﬂammatory envi-
ronment. They start to produce leishmanicidal molecules such as
NO and oxygen metabolites and become important effector cells
involved in skin-associated host defense. At that time cells of the
innate immune system are dominating the inﬂammatory response
at the site of infection. The adaptive Th1 cell mediated immune
response is initiated within SDLNs but is not established at the site
of infection yet.

INTERMEDIATE PHASE
Shortly after infection Leishmania-speciﬁc Th1 cells expand within
the SDLNs and accumulate at the site of infection (Brewig et al.,
2009). Thus two different types of T cell suppression might be
possible: (i) inhibition of T cell proliferation and (ii) inhibition of
T cell effector functions.

Due to the fact that MDSCs show an enhanced l-arginine
metabolism (e.g.,
increased arginase-1 activity) it might be
possible that l-arginine consuming MDSCs are responsible for
a local l-arginine deﬁciency. Given the fact that l-arginine is nec-
essary for cell proliferation it is therefore most likely that T cell
proliferation within SDLNs is reduced based on l-arginine limita-
tion. Furthermore, it is possible that NO that is released by MDSCs
directly inhibits the IL-2 receptor signaling and subsequently the
proliferation of T cells (Bingisser et al., 1998). Therefore, MDSCs
might be involved in the inhibition of T cell proliferation in
SDLNs.

The situation at the site of infection is quite different. Already
activated effector T cells migrate to the skin and the mechanism
how MDSC could suppress these activated effector cell function
is still not fully understood. However, it is possible that NO can
inhibit the release of Th1 cytokines by T cells (Bauer et al., 1997)
which might be mediated by reduced l-arginine availability in the
presence of MDSCs (Cuervo et al., 2011). Alternatively, the induc-
tion of apoptosis of effector T cells would be an elegant way to
suppress the ongoing T cell response.

Both MDSC mediated mechanisms such as controlling T cell
proliferation and activity are hypothetical. However, it might rep-
resent a smart move to dampen the host-derived immune response
that in turn gives some of the parasites the chance to survive within
mammalians.

SUMMARY
We aimed to highlight the potential role of TiP-DCs and MDSCs
in infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis. Assuredly, pathogens
such as Leishmania parasites interact with cells from the myeloid
system. However, based on the overlapping phenotypes of myeloid
cells, it becomes difﬁcult to denominate those cell types precisely.
In our point of view it cannot be excluded that the novel sub-
sets of “Tip-DCs” and “MDSCs” might not be classical “subsets”
but rather represent myeloid cells in a transient maturation stage
expressing different genes, in response to environment.

However, those NO-releasing myeloid cells can fulﬁll distinct
functions in the host defense against Leishmania parasites: they
might be involved in either controlling the parasite spreading
at the site of infection or dampening ongoing T cell responses.

myeloid cells to subsequent suppression of the adaptive immune
response needs to be further investigated. Additional studies are
therefore necessary to learn more about the factors regulating that
fascinating plasticity and the subsequent biological relevance of
phagocytic cell subsets after pathogen interaction.
