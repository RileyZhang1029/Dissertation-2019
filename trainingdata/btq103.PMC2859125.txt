Pangenome microarrays allow determining the genomic content of bacterial strains more accurately than conventional comparative genome hybridization microarrays.
PanCGHweb is the ﬁrst tool that effectively calls genotype based on pangenome microarray data.

In pangenomes, orthologous genes can be deﬁned as homologous genes derived by a strain divergence event from a single ancestral sequence.
These orthologous genes (strain orthologs) share different levels of nucleotide sequence identity with paralogous genes (homologous genes derived by a duplication event from a single sequence) (Fitch, 1970).
Effective genotyping can be achieved by grouping genes into ortholog groups (OGs) and subsequently genotyping at the level of OGs.
Recently, we published an algorithm (PanCGH) that effectively deals with assigning OG presence/absence to each strain analyzed by pangenome microarrays (Bayjanov et al., 2009).
Here, we describe a web tool PanCGHweb that uses this algorithm to effectively genotype strains based on pangenome microarray data.
Implementation  2 METHODS 2.1 PanCGHweb is implemented in Python and R, and its wizard-like web-interface is generated by the FG-web framework (S.A.F.T.van Hijum et al., unpublished data).
There are three major in the    sections  To whom correspondence should be addressed.
web-interface: (i) data upload  (ii) parameter settings  and (iii) displaying the results (Fig.
1A).
The web tool works with major web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.
Input data  2.2 Open reading frame sequences for each reference bacterial strain and/or plasmid, on which probes were designed, should be provided by (i) selecting from the available daily updated Genbank sequences and (ii) optionally, uploading FASTA-formatted DNA sequences that are absent in the Genbank list.
Normalized microarray hybridization data, where replicated measurements are represented by a single value (e.g.
by averaging), should also be provided as tab-delimited ﬁle(s).
Probe sequences should be provided in FASTA format.
2.3 Algorithm The PanCGH algorithm calls presence/absence of OGs based on pangenome microarray data.
PanCGHweb performs the following steps: (i) orthology grouping  (ii) alignment of probes to genes  and (iii) genotype calling.
Step 1: Inparanoid (Remm et al., 2001) is used with its default settings (minimum bit score of 50 and conﬁdence score of 0.25) for the orthology prediction among genes of the selected reference genomes (Genbank ﬁles  see above).
The run time of Inparanoid is reduced by a few orders of magnitudes by adapting the software to use BLAT (Kent, 2002) for sequence alignments.
Genes that are not part of the selected reference genomes can be grouped based on their homology, or each gene can form a separate group.
Step 2: the microarray probes are aligned by BLAT to the individual gene members of each OG.
Probes that could not be aligned to any gene and genes with no matching probes are reported.
Step 3: using the PanCGH algorithm (Bayjanov et al., 2009) the ﬂuorescence signal intensities of probes associated to each gene are summarized to a gene score (the most frequently occurring signal intensity).
The maximum of gene scores of all gene members of an OG is used as the presence score for that OG.
An OG is considered to be present if its presence score is above the threshold of 5.5 in log scale.
The steps involved in determining the optimal threshold value are described on the web site of PanCGHweb.

3 CONCLUSIONS For genotyping, pangenome microarrays offer a cost-effective alternative to DNA sequencing and allow to more accurately determine genomic content compared to standard CGH techniques.
We have developed a web tool for pangenome microarray analysis based on our PanCGH algorithm.
It enables researchers to analyze these complex hybridization data in a facile and transparent way to understand genomic diversity among related strains.
