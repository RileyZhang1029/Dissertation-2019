Accumulated lines of evidence suggest that hyperimmune responses to periodontal bacteria result in the
destruction of periodontal connective tissue and alveolar bone. The etiological roles of periodontal bacteria in
the onset and progression of periodontal disease (PD) are well documented. However, the mechanism
underlying the engagement of periodontal bacteria in RANKL-mediated alveolar bone resorption remains
unclear. Therefore, this review article addresses three critical subjects. First, we discuss earlier studies of
immune intervention, ultimately leading to the identification of bacteria-reactive lymphocytes as the cellular
source of osteoclast-induction factor lymphokine (now called RANKL) in the context of periodontal bone
resorption. Next, we consider (1) the effects of periodontal bacteria on RANKL production from a variety of
adaptive immune effector cells, as well as fibroblasts, in inflamed periodontal tissue and (2) the bifunctional
roles (upregulation vs. downregulation) of LPS produced from periodontal bacteria in a RANKL-induced
osteoclast-signal pathway. Future studies in these two areas could lead to new therapeutic approaches for the
management of PD by down-modulating RANKL production and/or RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis
in the context of host immune responses against periodontal pathogenic bacteria.

Periodontal disease (PD) is characterized by chronic

inflammation in tissues supporting the tooth.
Such inflammation is elicited by host innate and
adaptive immune response to a constellation of period-
ontal biofilm-associated multiple microorganisms (46, 98,
114). Studies have demonstrated that the etiology of
PD derives from periodontal pathogenic bacteria, such
as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Aggregatibacter actino-
mycetemcomitans (88, 89). While such periodontal patho-
gens are highly prevalent in periodontally compromised
individuals, they are also found in healthy periodontal
tissue (19, 30), albeit
to a lesser degree, suggesting
that host responses to periodontal pathogens play key
roles in the onset and progression of PD. To explain this
phenomenon, host immune response in healthy indivi-
duals seems to facilitate a sufficient protective mechanism
against colonization and infection (58). On the other

hand, in individuals with PD, host immune response to
periodontal pathogens seems to have lost effective control
against
the bacterial challenge (58, 62, 67). More
specifically, both hypo- and hyperimmune responses can
result in the pathogenesis of PD. For example, smoking-
associated PD appears to be caused by the suppression
of the immune system by the effect of nicotine (4, 7),
suggesting the engagement of hypoimmune responses in
the pathogenesis of PD. On the other hand, hyperimmune
responses to bacteria also result in the destruction of
periodontal tissues, such as gingiva and alveolar bone, as
determined by many studies (see later sections).

In earlier studies of the 1970s and 1980s, elevated IgG
antibody titers to multiple bacteria in patients’ sera were
declared to be the hallmark immune responses of PD.
Induction of IgG antibodies requires the engagement of
antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses to periodontal

bacteria (90, 101, 113); therefore, the elevated bacteria-
specific IgG antibodies found in patients with PD,
compared to healthy subjects, give clear evidence that
immune responses are induced to the bacteria. However,
it is also true that antibody responses to periodontal
bacteria can be detected in the sera of periodontally
healthy individuals (21, 22, 97). While the development of
B cell-rich lesion containing plasma cells is characteristic
of periodontally diseased gingival tissue (64, 77), it still
remains unclear if IgG produced from these B cells and
plasma cells infiltrating the diseased tissue is protective
for periodontal pathogens. In terms of the efficiency of
serum IgG antibody reactive to periodontal bacteria,
several studies conducted in 1990 showed that
the
avidity of serum IgG antibody found in the periodontally
diseased patient is relatively weak (115). However, it was
also found that avidity of serum IgG antibody increases
in the patient in response to periodontal treatment (15,
67), suggesting that an antibody produced in the patients
with PD may not function efficiently. Although, these
results implicated that IgG antibody response may be
associated with PD, the molecular mechanism underlying
the immune-associated periodontal bone resorption had
been unclear until the finding of the receptor activator
of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) in T- and B-
lymphocytes infiltrating periodontally diseased tissue
(48).

In order to investigate immune responses other than IgG
antibody response, a number of studies evaluated the
expression patterns of inflammatory cytokines produced
from lymphocytes, leukocytes, fibroblasts, and gingival
epithelial cells in the context of periodontal host innate
and adaptive immune responses (28, 29, 102). As a
consequence, several proinflammatory cytokines were
identified as key molecules contributing to the destruction
of periodontal tissue, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interferon-gamma (IFN-
g), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and, very importantly, RANKL
(60). In contrast to proinflammatory cytokines, including
IL-1, IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-6, which play roles in the
induction and upregulation of inflammatory responses in
PD lesion, RANKL was first discovered as a cytokine that
directly induces osteoclastogenesis (54, 112). As such, the
discovery of increased RANKL production in PD lesion
led (48), for the first time, to a plausible explanation for the
mechanism underlying alveolar bone resorption in period-
ontitis. The etiological roles of periodontal bacteria in the
onset and progression of PD are well documented (7, 10);
however, the mechanism underlying the engagement of
periodontal bacteria in RANKL-mediated alveolar bone
resorption remains unclear. Therefore, this review article
addresses three critical subjects. First, we discuss earlier
studies of immune intervention, ultimately leading to
the identification of bacteria-reactive lymphocytes as the
cellular source of osteoclast-induction factor lymphokine

(now called RANKL) in the context of periodontal bone
resorption. Next, we consider (1) the effects of periodontal
bacteria on RANKL production from a variety of adaptive
immune effector cells, as well as fibroblasts, in inflamed
periodontal
the bifunctional role of
LPS produced from periodontal bacteria in a RANKL-
induced osteoclast-signal pathway. Finally, possible new
therapeutic approaches for the management of PD by
targeting RANKL expression from activated T and B cells
are discussed.

Earlier studies that identified possible immune
intervention in periodontal bone resorption
Before RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis was found
to be engaged in periodontal bone loss, a number of
earlier studies conducted experiments demonstrating that
immune responses elicited to oral antigens,
including
bacteria, were involved in periodontal bone loss (Table 1).

Animal model of periodontal bone loss caused by
oral bacteria
In 1960, Bear and Newton (8) reported that naturally
developed alveolar bone loss in germ-free mice (68
months old) was lower than age-matched mice with
conventional oral flora, suggesting, for the first time, the
possible pathogenic role of oral bacteria in periodontal
bone resorption. The first animal model of periodontal
bone loss induced by bacterial infection was developed by
researchers at The Forsyth Dental Center (currently The
Forsyth Institute) (83, 85). Colonization of human gingival
plaque bacteria in gnotobiotic mice induced elevated
periodontal bone loss in about 5 months compared to the
control non-infected gnotobiotic mice (83). In another
experiment, the human oral bacterium Streptococcus
GS-5 was inoculated to both mice and rats, but only rats
retained the Streptococcus GS-5 in the oral cavity. Again, in
a follow-up study, an in vivo experiment using rats
demonstrated periodontal bone resorption 81 days after
bacterial inoculation (85). Although the aspect of immune
engagement in the pathogenic process of periodontal bone
loss was not addressed, these two studies clearly proved
that human oral bacteria can cause periodontal bone loss
in animals.

Induction of immune response to orally colonized
bacteria
It has long been accepted that immune tolerance, especially
to food and commensal intestinal bacteria, is induced
by gastrointestinal mucosa. As such, investigators asked
whether host immune response in oral mucosa could be
induced against oral bacteria. In 1963, Hyman and Zeldow
(40) used guinea pigs and hamsters to show that an Arthus
reaction could be induced in oral cheek mucosa in a
manner similar to the induction of an Arthus reaction to
the antigen challenged in cutaneous tissue. More specifi-

Role of periodontal pathogens in bone loss of PD

cally, after systemic immunization with ovalbumin (OVA),
the local challenge with OVA-induced Arthus reaction
characterized by inflammation accompanied by IgG anti-
body to OVA as well as C4 complement deposition in
the local tissue (40). The investigators did not further
examine if such immune induction could lead to period-
ontal bone resorption. Nonetheless, this study did reveal
that protein antigens challenged to oral mucosa could elicit
immune response at the challenged site (40). In order to
examine if immune response to oral bacteria could be
induced in human subjects, a hypersensitivity skin test for
oral Actinomyces was carried out in patients with PD
compared to healthy subjects (73). It was found that
a positive reaction induced by cutaneous injection of
Actinomyces antigen was significantly higher in period-
ontally diseased subjects than subjects with either gingivitis
or healthy mucosa (73), suggesting that humans with
PD can indeed be immunologically predisposed to oral
bacteria.

type hypersensitivity
The
that demonstrated immune
experiment
responses to oral bacteria with subsequent periodontal
bone loss was carried out by Guggenheim et al. (27).
Germ-free rats systemically immunized (i.v.) with killed
Actinomyces viscosus, when compared to control non-
immunized germ-free rats, developed a significantly
higher level of periodontal bone resorption in response
to the oral inoculation of live A. viscosus. Based on the
increased serum antibody response to A. viscosus and
inflammatory infiltration into the periodontal tissue,
it was determined that delayed-type hypersensitivity
(DTH or Type-IV hypersensitivity: cell-mediated immune
memory response) elicited to A. viscosus resulted in
periodontal bone loss (27). Using a primate model
of PD, Nisengard et al. (74) also demonstrated that
Arthus-type immune responses (or Type-III hypersensi-
tivity: IgG-antigen immune complex-mediated response)
induced to topically applied bovine serum albumin
(BSA) or ovalbumin (OVA) could cause periodontal
bone loss. Based on the elevated level of serum antibody
response to BSA or OVA, inflammatory infiltration into
the periodontal tissue, and the increased deposition of
IgG and C4 complement around the perivascular site of
periodontal tissue, it was determined that Arthus-type
immune responses caused the periodontal bone loss (74).
During the 1970s, both delayed-type and Arthus-
type hypersensitivity were presumed to be the putative
pathogenic causes of periodontal bone resorption (61, 75).
However, current consensus appears to support the idea
that adaptive immune responses mediated by T and B cells
account for RANKL-dependent periodontal bone loss

because RANKL, as a cytokine produced from activated
memory T and B cells without engagement of antibody, is
now thought to be responsible for periodontal bone loss
(18, 32, 98, 103). Therefore, this T and B cell-mediated
memory response may be considered an extension of the
classic DTH theory, which also results from the recall of
cell-mediated memory response (12, 52). However, it is
still plausible that Arthus-type hypersensitivity (or IgG-
antigen immune complex-mediated response)
is also
involved in periodontal bone resorption based on a
premise that IgG immune complex-mediated Fc receptor
(FcR) activation may be able to elicit co-stimulation for
RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, which is explained
in detail below. In sum, the studies carried out in the 1970s
ultimately led to the prediction of an osteoclastogenesis
factor, termed lymphokine, which was thought to be
produced by activated T cells (61, 75). Some 20 years later,
lymphokine was shown to be RANKL, a cytokine that is
produced not only by activated T and B cells, but also by
osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells. As described
throughout this review, RANKL plays a pivotal role
in both pathogenic and homeostatic bone resorption
processes.

actinomycetemcomitans

An animal model demonstrates that activated T and
B cell response to oral bacterial antigens can cause
periodontal bone resorption
While the studies described above indicated the association
of immune responses to periodontal bone resorption, the
direct cellular mechanism underlying immune-mediated
periodontal bone loss remained unclear until 1984. At that
time, Taubman et al. (101) (Forsyth Dental Center) found
in a rat model of PD, preimmunization with
that,
[Actinobacillus
Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans was
reclassified in 2006 as
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (76)] could induce
periodontal bone loss in rats orally infected with A.
actinomycetemcomitans concomitant with DTH response
induced to A. actinomycetemcomitans. Normal
rats
receiving adoptive transfer of A. actinomycetemcomitans-
sensitized T lymphocytes prior to infection with A.
actinomycetemcomitans also demonstrated increased
DTH and periodontal bone loss (101). Interestingly,
congenitally athymic rats (nude) showed more periodontal
bone loss than normal
littermates in the same A.
actinomycetemcomitans-immunization plus an oral A.
actinomycetemcomitans-infection model, indicating that
the thymus might contain T cells with regulatory function
(101). For the first time, this study showed that antigen-
primed T cells induced in the context of DTH response to
oral bacteria could exert bone destructive effects, whereas a
T-cell subset present in the thymus could potentially
facilitate regulatory effects.

Yoshie et al. (113), using the same rat model of PD,
later demonstrated that periodontal bone loss was

increased in nude rats compared to normal rats. Since
nude rat periodontal tissue with bone resorption was
characterized by B cell-rich lesion, it was suggested that
the potentially excessive B cell response to abundant
bacterial antigens might also contribute to the develop-
ment of immune-mediated periodontal bone resorption
(113). In support of this theory, thymus cell reconstitu-
tion of
the nude rats partially abrogated the bone
destruction (113), indicating that the thymus may indeed
contain the T cells with regulatory function. It should be
noted that a recent study revealed that FOXP3 T
regulatory (Treg) cells derived from thymus play a pivotal
role in the downregulation of adaptive immune responses
(80). While the pathophysiological relevance of Treg cells
in PD is still controversial (24, 25, 71), our group found
that
the prevalence of functionally active Treg cells
diminish in the periodontally diseased tissue compared
to healthy gingival tissue (24). It was also shown that IL-
10, a key regulatory cytokine produced from Treg cells,
suppressed both RANKL expression by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells
(PBMC) activated in vitro in a
bacterial antigen-specific manner (24). Thus, these two
studies carried out in the 1980s implicated that thymus-
derived Treg cells may be involved in the suppression of
immune-mediated periodontal bone resorption.

Effects of periodontal bacteria on RANKL
production from a variety of host immune cells
in inflamed periodontal tissue

Biological basis of RANKL/RANK/OPG interaction
Osteoimmunology is a research field that investigates the
interaction between the skeletal and immune systems at the
molecular to cellular levels (63, 94). Among a number of
inflammatory bone-resorption diseases, PD is a disease
whose route to alveolar bone loss by pathophysio-
logical processes can be most appropriately explained in
osteoimmunological terms. As noted above, although a
constellation of oral microorganisms that
the
gingival crevice is a permissive etiologic factor (87), it is
the host immune responses to these microorganisms that
lead to the destruction of periodontal bone tissues by
production of RANKL from activated lymphocytes that
react to such periodontal pathogens (31, 100).

infect

The identification and characterization of RANKL,
its receptor RANK, and soluble decoy receptor osteo-
protegerin (OPG) have significantly contributed to the
understanding of the skeletal remodeling mechanism
involving differentiation of osteoclasts
(osteoclasto-
genesis) and their activation (Fig. 1) (37, 57, 86). Gene
knockout mice deficient in RANKL or RANK, respec-
tively, not only present osteopetrotic phenotypes, but also
lack peripheral lymph nodes (20, 55), supporting the idea
that both RANKL and RANK play pivotal roles in
osteoclastogenesis, as well as in the immune development,

preosteoclasts is overwhelming relative to the amount of OPG (a natural antagonist of RANKL), RANKL then becomes
available to bind RANK expressed on preosteoclasts, tipping the balance of skeletal remodeling to favor the activation of
osteoclast formation and bone resorption. On the other hand, in the condition where relative ratio of RANKL over OPG
becomes low, OPG-mediated inhibition of ligation between RANKL and RANK decreases the osteoclastogenesis. The
inhibition of RANKL-binding to RANK by OPG also promotes apoptosis of activated mature osteoclasts. Therefore, the
relative ratio of RANKL over OPG determines the velocity and intensity of bone resorption mediated by osteoclastogenesis.

as shown by RANKL expressed on Th1-type cells, which
then act on dendritic cells to induce their production of
proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1b and IL-6 (44).
Moreover, when the amount of RANKL produced in the
microenvironment surrounding preosteoclasts is over-
whelming relative to the production of OPG, which acts
as a natural antagonist of RANKL, it has been shown that
RANKL then becomes available to bind RANK expressed
on osteoclast precursors, tipping the balance of skeletal
remodeling to favor the activation of osteoclast formation
and bone resorption (Fig. 1, left). When hematopoietic

colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) induces the expression
of RANK on CFU-M. Subsequently, RANK remains
expressed on osteoclast lineage cells throughout their life
span until terminally differentiated on multinucleated cells
(4). Therefore, the binding of RANKL to RANK not only
elicits osteoclastogenesis, but it also promotes the survival
and activation of osteoclast cells, which, in turn, results
in bone resorption. Conversely, when OPG concentration
is higher relative to the level of expressed RANKL, the
binding of OPG to RANKL interrupts its ligation to

RANK (Fig. 1, right). This OPG-mediated inhibition of
ligation between RANKL and RANK then decreases the
velocity and intensity of osteoclastogenesis and promotes
apoptosis of previously differentiated and activated osteo-
clasts, thus reducing the process of bone resorption (14).

pathogens
The recent discovery of
the RANKL/OPG ratio in
relation to its effect on osteoclastogenesis, as described
above, led investigators to examine the expression pattern
of RANKL and OPG in periodontitis (48, 66, 81). Based
on a study using human clinical samples, tissue homo-
genate isolated from diseased periodontal
lesion with
bone resorption showed significantly higher levels of
RANKL protein than gingival tissue taken from healthy
subjects, whereas OPG protein detected in diseased tissue
was lower than that in healthy gingival tissue (59, 110).
Furthermore,

was significantly elevated in periodontitis compared with
healthy subjects or patients with gingivitis (13). Further-
more, the latter study demonstrated a positive correlation
between the level of RANKL/OPG ratio and clinical
parameters of periodontal pocket depth and clinical
attachment loss (13), suggesting that elevated levels of
local RANKL/OPG are responsible for periodontal bone
resorption. Therefore, any clinical intervention that tips
the balance between RANKL and OPG such that
periodontal bone resorption is inhibited would lead to a
most novel therapeutic regimen (99).

Based on these findings showing elevated expression of
RANKL in periodontally diseased tissue, many studies
were conducted to identify the cellular source of RANKL
or OPG in periodontal tissue. Osteoblasts, which originate
from mesenchymal
stem cells, had previously been
discovered as vital cells that produce RANKL and OPG
in bone tissue (14). However, since fibroblasts are also
mesenchymal lineage cells, gingival fibroblasts and period-
ontal ligament fibroblasts are also considered to be a
source of RANKL and OPG in periodontal tissue (Fig. 2).
Interestingly, periodontal ligament fibroblasts, which play
crucial roles in regulating the homeostasis of periodontal
ligaments that connect bone and cementum, are reported
to express mRNA for both RANKL and OPG (45, 50, 81).

ligament

The conditioned medium isolated from the culture of
periodontal
fibroblasts abrogated osteoclast
formation from mouse bone marrow macrophages (50),
suggesting that periodontal ligament fibroblasts secrete
OPG to inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation
(Fig. 2). On the other hand, when human periodontal
ligament fibroblasts were co-cultured with peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, osteoclastogenesis was induced
in the co-culture (45), indicating that human periodontal
ligament fibroblasts express functionally active mem-
brane-bound RANKL (Fig. 2). Since periodontal ligament
fibroblasts are a source of membrane-bound, but not
soluble, RANKL, but concurrently produce OPG, they
appear to have properties in common with osteoblasts. For
example, in response to IL-1 stimulation, both periodontal
ligament fibroblasts and osteoblasts express RANKL and
OPG mRNA via PKA and PKC signaling, respectively
(38).

Gingival fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cells
in gingival connective tissues, showed expression of OPG
mRNA, while their expression of RANKL mRNA was
weak (38) or undetectable (81). The stimulation of gingival
fibroblasts with IL-1 induced expression of OPG mRNA,
but not RANKL mRNA, via a signaling cascade involving
PKA (38). However, it is also reported that cytolethal

RANKL (mRANKL), but little OPG, in response to bacterial stimulation, increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio. In contrast to
periodontal ligament ﬁbroblasts, it appears that gingival ﬁbroblasts downregulate osteoclastogenesis by their production of
OPG, but not RANKL, in response to inﬂammatory mediators, whereas they may produce RANKL in the periodontal tissue
upon stimulation by bacterial virulent factors. Bacterial antigen presentation by professional antigen presenting cells (APC),
such as dendritic cells, induces effector T lymphocytes to express both mRANKL and soluble RANKL (sRANKL). Bacterial
antigen-engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) induces B cells to produce not only the IgG antibody but also mRANKL and
sRANKL. Furthermore, the activated antigen-speciﬁc T cells provide B cells co-stimulatory signals through CD40/CD40L
ligation, which also is considered to upregulate the RANKL expression from B cells.

distending toxin (CDT) produced from A. actinomycetem-
comitans can induce in vitro RANKL expression from
human gingival fibroblasts (11). Arg-gingipains produced
from P. gingivalis are also indicated to upregulate the
RANKL/OPG expression ratio in gingival fibroblasts (10).
It was also reported that in a co-culture with human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, gingival fibroblasts,
inhibit the induction of
but not ligament fibroblasts,
osteoclasts (116). Therefore,
it appears that gingival
fibroblasts downregulate osteoclastogenesis by their
production of OPG, but not RANKL, in response to
inflammatory mediators, whereas they may also produce
RANKL in the periodontal tissue upon stimulation by
bacterial virulence factors (Fig. 2).

A large number of in vitro studies have examined whether
periodontal pathogenic bacteria affect the expressions of
RANKL/OPG in fibroblasts. In terms of periodontal
ligament fibroblasts, fixed-bacteria, or their constituents,
including enzyme or toxin, induced RANKL expression.
The A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS (79, 105), CTD (11),
and P. gingivalis Arg-gingipaine (13) all stimulated period-
ontal ligament fibroblasts to produce RANKL mRNA
expression. Furthermore, although there are several con-
troversial results, bacterial stimulations reduced OPG
expression (17, 105) or increased the ratio of RANKL
over OPG (RANKL/OPG ratio) (13) in periodontal
ligament fibroblasts (Fig. 2). In relation to the engagement
of IL-1 in RANKL/OPG expression as noted above (38), it
is reported that LPS stimulates expression of both OPG
and RANKL in periodontal
ligament fibroblasts via
induction of IL-1b and TNF-a (109) (Fig. 2), suggesting
that LPS can induce both inflammation and bone resorp-
tion concomitantly.

enhanced OPG mRNA expression, whereas RANKL
mRNA expression was not induced by LPS-stimulation
(69). In addition,
the conditioned medium isolated
from gingival fibroblasts stimulated with LPS inhibited
RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (69), suggesting that
functionally active OPG that can neutralize RANKL is
induced in gingival fibroblasts by stimulation with LPS.
These findings suggested that periodontal pathogenic
bacteria do affect the RANKL/OPG ratio in periodontal
ligament fibroblasts in a manner different from gingival
that both RANKL
fibroblasts (Fig. 2); namely (1)
and OPG can be produced by periodontal
ligament
fibroblasts, with stimulation of periodontal pathogens
increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio; and (2) that gingival
fibroblasts produce OPG, but not RANKL, with the
stimulation of periodontal pathogens decreasing the
RANKL/OPG ratio.

However, in contrast to the in vitro results demonstrating
RANKL expression by bacterially stimulated fibroblasts,
it should be noted that RANKL expression by fibroblasts
is considerably lower than that of immune cells in the

Role of periodontal pathogens in bone loss of PD

physiological context of human PD or the animal model of
PD, as measured using immunohistochemical staining
(110). As described below, a high expression of RANKL
was detected from T and B lymphocytes, but not from
fibroblasts, in human periodontally diseased tissue (48).
Based on these lines of evidence, it is speculated that
RANKL or OPG derived from fibroblasts may play roles
in regulating the homeostasis of healthy bone remodeling,
whereas, in the inflamed PD tissue, T and B lymphocytes,
rather than fibroblasts, are engaged in bone resorption
processes.

Source of RANKL in PD: bacterial antigen-specific
T and B lymphocytes are key players in RANKL-
mediated bone resorption
Initial reports demonstrated that RANKL expressed by T
lymphocytes can contribute to the bone resorption
induced in mouse adjuvant arthritis (54). Based on these
findings, the possible engagement of T lymphocytes was
explored in the mechanism of periodontal bone resorption
as a source of RANKL production in periodontitis.
Accordingly, in periodontally diseased gingival tissues,
several studies indicated that both T lymphocytes and B
lymphocytes express RANKL (16, 48, 59). By using
immunohistochemistry analysis,
it was revealed that
RANKL protein associated with lymphocytes and macro-
phages was expressed at significantly higher levels in
periodontitis tissue (110). Furthermore, our group pre-
viously described that abundant RANKL was expressed
on CD3 T cells and CD20 B cells, but only minimally,
or not at all, on CD14 monocytes in the tissue of
patients with chronic periodontitis (48, 65). Otherwise, in
healthy gingival tissue, very few RANKL-expressing cells
were present (48, 65). Importantly, more than 50% of T
cells and 90% of B cells expressed RANKL in period-
ontitis tissue, whereas less than 20% of either B cells or T
cells showed RANKL expression in healthy gingival
tissue. The concentrations of RANKL, but not OPG,
were significantly higher in periodontitis tissue as opposed
to healthy tissue (48). Further,
lymphocytes derived
from the gingival tissues of patients induced osteoclast
differentiation in vitro (48). In another study, CD4 T
lymphocytes were the predominant cell type present in the
gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis, and they
were the main cells responsible for the higher levels of
RANKL observed in these patients (108). These findings
obtained from gingival tissues isolated from individuals
with periodontitis suggested that activated lymphocytes
seem to be a particularly critical source of RANKL in PD
(Fig. 2).

Since these studies using clinical

tissue samples
indicated that RANKL derived from lymphocytes seems
to play a pivotal role in periodontal bone resorption,
many investigators have tried to elucidate the mechanism
by which lymphocytes are activated and ultimately cause

RANKL-mediated bone destruction (Fig. 2). Using a
mouse model, Teng et al. demonstrated that RANKL
produced by bacteria-reactive activated CD4 T lym-
phocytes can initiate local alveolar bone resorption (102).
In their model, mouse PD was induced by the trans-
plantation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes
isolated from periodontitis patients into non-obese dia-
betic (NOD) severe combined immunodeficiency disease
(SCID) mice (102). Reconstitution of human CD4 T
cells, but not CD8 T cells,
isolated from localized
aggressive periodontitis (LAG) in the NOD-SCID mice,
which were orally colonized with A. actinomycetem-
comitans, resulted in local alveolar bone destruction in
an RANKL-dependent manner (102). Our group has also
developed a periodontal bone resorption model by
adaptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells (47, 49). In
these studies, to prime T cells, the outer membrane
protein (OMP) along with A. actinomycetemcomitans
LPS were used as T cell antigen and adjuvant, respec-
tively (47, 49). Gingival injection of this antigen/adjuvant
mixture could induce local bone resorption after the
transfer of antigen-specific Th1-type clone cells, but not
Th2-type clone cells. Interestingly, to generate the anti-
gen-specific T cells, both TCR signaling stimulated by
antigen presenting cells and CD28 co-stimulation in-
duced by B7, which is expressed in antigen presenting
cells, were required (35). For the first time, the idea that T
cells could be activated by B7 antigen presenting cells in
local gingival tissue was supported. In addition, another
study indicated that P. gingivalis can cause periodontal
bone loss by induction of RANKL from the activation of
lymphocytes (43). Most importantly,
in these rodent
bone loss models, the inhibition of RANKL by OPG
reduced periodontal bone destruction. These findings
suggested that antigen-specific T lymphocytes, which are
activated by antigen presenting cells,

tissue (Fig. 2).

trigger

It is thought that activated B cells in periodontally
diseased tissues protect the host from bacterial infection by
their production of IgG antibodies. However,
it was
hypothesized that B cells might also contribute to bone
tissue destruction by their production of RANKL because
(1) B lymphocytes are abundant in inflamed periodontal
lesions (64, 84); (2) excessive B-cell response represented
by IgG antibody to abundant bacterial antigens (23, 68,
104) may contribute to the development of immune-
mediated periodontal bone resorption, as demonstrated
by Taubman et al.’s PD model using nude rats (101, 113);
and (3) B cells highly expressed RANKL in human gingival
tissue with periodontal bone loss lesion (48). To investigate
whether and how RANKL derived from activated B
lymphocytes plays a role in bone resorption, adoptive
transfer of antigen-specific B cells into a T cell-deficient rat

model was developed (31, 33). These studies demonstrated
that activated B cells stimulated with A. actinomycetemco-
mitans highly express RANKL and that adoptive transfer
of the antigen-specific B lymphocytes can contribute to
increased periodontal bone resorption in mice injected
with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Importantly, administra-
tion of OPG-Fc to this B-cell transfer model abrogated
the periodontal bone loss (31) in a manner similar to the
antigen-specific T-cell transfer model (107), suggesting
that the periodontal bone resorption induced by B-cell
transfer was RANKL-dependent (31, 33).

It is well known that the CD40 ligand (CD40L) is found
almost exclusively on activated, but not naı¨ve CD4, T
cells, and that its counter-ligand, CD40, is constitutively
expressed on B cells. The ligation of CD40/CD40L initiates
both humoral and cellular immune responses, including
the expression of numerous cytokines and chemokines, as
well as a class switch of immunoglobulin (3, 7). Therefore,
we asked whether CD40/CD40L-mediated co-stimulation
could induce RANKL production from activated B cells.
Very recently, we found that the systemic administration of
an anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody reduced the period-
ontal bone resorption of rats that had received antigen-
specific CD4 Th1 cell transfer and gingival injections of
antigens (32). These findings suggested that antigen-
specific T cells not only produce RANKL, but also induce
activation of B cells through CD40/CD40L interaction,
which leads to robust RANKL production (Fig. 2). Based
on these results, we can conclude that antigen-specific T
and B cells stimulated by periodontal pathogenic bacteria,
which infiltrate the periodontal lesion close to the bone
resorption site, are prominent sources of RANKL in the
context of periodontal bone loss.

Co-stimulatory molecules for RANKL-mediated
osteoclastogenesis: possible co-stimulatory
contribution by IgG-Ag immune complex
Osteoclast-associated
receptor
(OSCAR), along with a triggering receptor expressed
on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), are the recently discovered
co-stimulatory molecules in RANKL-mediated osteo-
clast activation (Fig. 3) (53). As demonstrated in Fig. 3,
the main biological event that induces osteoclastogenesis
is RANKL binding to its receptor, RANK, in coordina-
tion with co-stimulatory signaling provided by OSCAR
and/or TREM2 (53). Importantly, OSCAR transmits its
signal
through an adaptor molecule, FcR common
gamma-chain (FcRg; Fig. 3) (53, 92). In addition to the
engagement of FcRg in osteoclastogenesis, FcRg is used
as an adaptor molecule in order to transmit the signal
upon occupation of IgGFcRs (FcgRIA and FcgRIIIA)
by the Fc-region of IgG in the form of an immune
complex (IC; Fig. 3). Upon ligation of OSCAR or FcRs
with their respective ligand (the specific ligand for

along with co-stimulatory signaling provided by OSCAR and/or TREM2 elicits osteoclastogenesis (TREM2 is not shown).
Upon ligation of OSCAR with its speciﬁc ligand (currently unknown), a signaling adaptor molecule for OSCAR, Fc receptor
common gamma-chain (FcRg) is activated. Subsequently, the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
motif (ITAM) present in FcRg upregulates phospholipase Cg (PLCg) and calcium signaling, which leads to the induction of
gene expression required for osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, FcRg the signaling adaptor molecule for OSCAR, is shared by
IgG-Fc receptors (FcgRIA and FcgRIIIA). Therefore, it is hypothesized that the occupation of IgG-Fc receptors expressed on
osteoclasts with IgG-immune complex (IC) may provide co-stimulatory signaling for RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis.

OSCAR is currently unclear), phosphorylation of im-
munoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)
present in FcRg up-regulates phospholipase Cg (PLCg)
and calcium signaling in osteoclast precursors as well
92). For osteoclast
as other
precursors, DNAX-activating protein 12
(DAP12;
ITAM-harboring adaptor for TREM2) also functions
similar to OSCAR-FcRg in providing co-stimulatory
signals during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. In
other words, both DAP12 and FcRg elicit essential co-
stimulatory signals to the RANK-induced signaling
cascades for terminal differentiation of osteoclasts (53,
92). Therefore, ITAM-dependent co-stimulatory signals
induced by multiple different
immunoreceptors are
considered to play a key role in promoting RANKL-
mediated osteoclastogenesis.

Of the three main types of FcgR in mice and humans,
the high-affinity receptor FcgRI can bind monomeric
IgG, whereas the two low-affinity receptors, FcgRII and
FcgRIII, bind polymeric IgG in the form of immune
complexes (IC) (92). More specifically, while monomeric
IgG cannot induce activation signals, an IC formed of
multiple IgG antibodies can induce activation signals in

the cells expressing FcgRs by the mechanical
force
provided by multiple tightly connected IgG antibodies
(the so-called capping effects) (6). As shown in Fig. 4,
deposition of IgG-IC was found in periodontally diseased
gingival tissue, but very little in healthy gingival tissue,
using C1q complement as an IgGAgIC detection
module (Fig. 4). Therefore, it is plausible that IgG-IC in
the diseased gingival tissues can bind all three FcgRs
(FcgRI, FcgRII, and FcgRIII) and may then trigger co-
stimulatory signals in the RANKL-stimulated osteoclast
precursor cells. Based on our in vitro studies (Fig. 4), in the
absence of RANKL, stimulation of FcRs alone with IgG-
IC did not induce osteoclast differentiation; whereas,
in the presence of RANKL, activation of FcRs mediated
by IgG-IC upregulates RANKL-induced osteoclastogen-
esis. Therefore, we
that FcRs provide
co-stimulatory signals in RANKL-mediated osteoclasto-
genesis (Fig. 4). The presence of IC in periodontitis
patients (26, 106), combined with the expression of
FcRg on osteoclast precursor cells (53), is expected to
upregulate osteoclastogenesis triggered by RANKL that,
in turn, augments the development of periodontal bone
loss lesions.

chemical staining for IC. As an IgG-IC detection module,
C1q complement (Sigma, St Louis, MO) conjugated with
biotin, was reacted with the tissue section, followed by a
reaction with streptavidin-peroxidase, color development
with DAB, and methyl green nuclear staining. The deposi-
tions of C1q reactive IC was monitored in the gingival
epithelium as well as lamina propria of a patient with
periodontal disease. The IC bearing cells in the patient’s
gingival epithelium appeared to be dendritic cells. Only slight
staining of IC was found in the gingival epithelium of
periodontally healthy subjects. (B) Possible effects of IgG-

recombinant A. actinomycetemcomitans Omp29 and mouse

comitans Omp29 (anti-Omp29 IgG-IC). Bone marrow cells

signal

LPS-induced innate immune TLR signaling may
promote or inhibit osteoclastogenesis
The LPS, a major constituent of the cell wall of gram-
negative bacteria, has long been recognized as a key factor
implicated in the development of chronic periodontitis
(36, 70). Previously, many studies revealed the effect of
LPS on RANKL source cells, as described above, and its
role in RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. It is well
documented that monocyte lineage cells, such as dendritic
cells and macrophages, utilize Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
as an innate immune sensor to recognize LPS. Interest-
ingly, osteoclasts, like macrophages, express TLR4, since
osteoclasts are derived from same monocyte lineage cells
originated from hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore,
the ligation of LPS to TLR4 expressed on preosteoclasts
seems to provide co-stimulatory signaling to RANKL-
mediated osteoclastogenesis (35). Since signaling caused
by TLR4 shares some of the downstream signal transdu-
cers, such as TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6),
NF-kB, and MAPKs, with RANK signaling (2, 42), it was
hypothesized that LPS would accelerate RANKL-
mediated osteoclastogenesis, enhancing RANK signaling.
Indeed, the vast majority of previous studies described
LPS as promoting osteoclastogenesis (34, 41, 43, 91, 96), a
finding that suggests that LPS may play a role in alveolar
bone loss in periodontitis. Interestingly, however, some
previous studies also demonstrated a bifunctional role
of LPS in osteoclastogenesis. In other words,
it was
found that LPS can either potentiate or inhibit RANK
signaling, depending on the stage of osteoclast precursor
differentiation (78, 93). When preosteoclasts were pre-
treated with RANKL, it was shown that LPS upregulated
osteoclastogenesis. On the contrary, when LPS and
RANKL were simultaneously added to the cultures of
preosteoclasts, LPS stimulation inhibited RANKL-
mediated osteoclast differentiation. While this is an
interesting finding that may gain insight into the regula-
tory role of LPS in the pathogenesis of PD, the effects of
LPS in the suppression of periodontal bone resorption
have, thus far, not received enough attention.

Only very recently has the signal transduction mechan-
ism underlying this dual effect of LPS in osteoclastogenesis
been explained in detail by the study of Liu et al. (39). In
this study, they demonstrated that LPS abolishes JNK
and NF-kB activity in virgin preosteoclasts that were
previously exposed to only M-CSF, but not RANKL
(Fig. 5) (39). As a consequence, the expression of NFATc1,
which is a master transcriptional factor initiating osteo-
clastogenesis (95), was suppressed by LPS in the virgin
preosteoclasts (Fig. 5) (39). On the other hand, when
preosteoclasts were pretreated with RANKL, the inhibi-
tory effect of LPS disappeared, and LPS stimulated JNK
and NF-kB activity that activated the expression of
NFATc1 (Fig. 5) (39). Such results delineate the distinct
bifunctional effects of LPS on the fundamental signal

Fig. 5. Possible bifunctional effects of LPS on RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Bifunctional effects of LPS on the
different differentiation stages of preosteoclasts were discovered recently: (1) LPS down-modulates osteoclastogenesis signaling
in the virgin preosteoclasts that are only exposed to M-CSF, but not RANKL; and (2) LPS upregulates osteoclastogenesis
signaling in intermediately differentiated preosteoclasts that are stimulated with both M-CSF and RANKL. Based on these
ﬁndings, it is further proposed that (1) virgin preosteoclasts may turn into phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, in response to
LPS, and (2) preosteoclasts may differentiate into osteoclastic lineage cells by RANKL stimulation in the absence of LPS.

transduction pathways requisite for osteoclastogenesis in
different differentiation stages of preosteoclasts; that is, (1)
virgin preosteoclasts that are only exposed to M-CSF but
not RANKL, and (2) intermediately differentiated pre-
osteoclasts that are stimulated with both M-CSF and
RANKL (Fig. 5). LPS down-modulates osteoclasto-
genesis signaling in the virgin preosteoclasts, while it
upregulates osteoclastogenesis signaling in intermediately
differentiated preosteoclasts (Fig. 5). In addition, several
reports revealed that LPS promotes cell survival of
RANKL-induced mature multinucleated osteoclasts by
activating Akt, NF-kB, and ERK via MyD88 (Fig. 5) (39,
82). These findings suggested that (1) virgin preosteoclasts
may turn into phagocytic, as opposed to osteoclastic, cells
(93)
in response to LPS, or (2) preosteoclasts may
differentiate into osteoclastic lineage cells by RANKL
stimulation in the absence of LPS (Fig. 5). Finally, in
contrast to Gram () bacteria, multiple Gram ()
bacteria present the full source of LPS. Thus, in cases
where the onset of PD is caused by Gram () bacteria,
LPS will accelerate RANKL signaling in preosteoclasts
previously stimulated with both M-CSF and RANKL,
an event that then causes more intensive induction of

osteoclast differentiation and cell survival and, hence,
increasingly severe bone destruction (Fig. 5).

In contrast to LPS produced from a majority of Gram
() bacteria that binds to TLR4 (1), P. gingivalis LPS is
known to activate TLR2 (9), which can also induce
RANKL expression from cementoblasts (72) and period-
ontal ligament cells (56). A recent study revealed that P.
gingivalis can produce unique sphingolipids that promote
RANKL expression from osteoblast cells via ligation to
TLR2 (111). Therefore, TLR2 ligands produced from
P. gingivalis appear to promote osteoclastogenesis by
activating TLR2. However, the effects of P. gingivalis LPS
on RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis in the light of
the above-mentioned bifunctional effects remain unclear.
In addition to TLR2 and TLR4, TLR9 was reported to
promote osteoclastogenesis (5), while, at the same time,
there seems to be a cell signal system where the CpG
(TLR9 ligand)-activated genes are subsequently down-
regulated (51). In the context of polymicrobial infection
in periodontally diseased tissue, it is therefore plausible
that multiple different TLR ligands affect RANKL-
mediated osteoclastogenesis by activating diverse signal-
ing pathways. Hence, we expect that future studies would

Fig. 6. Immune intervention in the bacteria-associated periodontal of bone resorption. Schematic illustration presents
hypothetical mechanisms of
immune intervention in the periodontal bone resorption induced by RANKL-mediated
osteoclastogenesis. RANKL produced from activated adaptive immune effector cells (i.e. T and B cells) in response to
periodontal bacteria play a signiﬁcant role in pathogenic bone resorption. While the IgG antibody response to periodontal
bacteria is thought to protect the host from bacterial challenge, the IgG-immune complex (IgGIC) developed in diseased tissue
with chronic periodontitis may promote inﬂammatory bone resorption by providing a co-stimulation to RANKL-mediated
osteoclastogenesis through its binding to Fc receptors expressed on osteoclasts.

explore the effects of multiple different TLR ligands
released from the polymicrobial biofilm on the RANKL-
mediated osteoclastogenesis in the PD.

Possible therapeutic approaches for inhibition
of periodontal bone loss by targeting
lymphocytes derived RANKL
We know that the production of RANKL from bacterial
antigen-specific T and B cells seems to trigger periodontal
bone loss and that the suppression of antigen-specific T
and B cell responses may sufficiently facilitate down-
modulation of periodontal bone destruction. Thus, we

might envision an ideal therapy that suppresses the bone
destructive consequences of antigen-specific T and B cells
while, at the same time, permitting the homeostatic bone
remodeling mediated by RANKL-produced from osteo-
blasts and bone marrow stromal cells. Indeed, we have
previously described that interference with co-stimulatory
molecules, which are required for induction of antigen-
specific T and B cells, abrogated periodontal bone
resorption. In other words, systemic administration of
CTLA4Ig, a functional antagonist of CD28 binding to
B7 (47), or anti-CD40 ligand antibody to inhibit CD40/
CD40L (32), could theoretically abrogate bone resorption

in an animal periodontal model. In addition to these
approaches, we are now challenged to establish new
therapeutic regimens to mediate the antigen-specific T
and B cells. For example, one approach that is attracting
wide attention involves the utilization of regulatory
CD4 T cells (Treg cells), which play a suppressive role
in inflammation caused by the activation of adaptive T
cell responses (80). Accordingly, our group and others
have focused on the application of Treg cells to modulate
periodontal bone loss. This line of
investigation is
expected to help in the development of new therapeutic
approaches to stop progressive bone resorption induced
by oral bacterial challenge.

Summary
In the 1960s through the 1980s, prior to the discovery of
RANKL, researchers in the field of periodontology had
already predicted the presence of a putative osteoclasto-
genesis factor produced by bacterially activated lympho-
cytes. The consensus now holds that RANKL, a cytokine
that induces osteoclastogenesis is produced from acti-
vated adaptive immune effector cells (i.e. T and B cells) in
response to periodontal bacteria and appears to play a
significant role in pathogenic bone resorption (Fig. 6).
While the IgG antibody response to periodontal bacteria
is thought to protect the host from bacterial challenge,
the IgG-immune complex (IgGIC) developed in diseased
tissue with chronic periodontitis may, in fact, promote
inflammatory bone resorption by providing a co-stimula-
tion to RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis through its
binding to FcRs expressed on osteoclasts (Fig. 6).

Recent studies indicated the bifunctional effects of LPS
on the fundamental signal transduction pathways requisite
for osteoclastogenesis in different differentiation stages
of preosteoclasts. The LPS downregulates the expression
of NFATc1, a master regulator of osteoclastogenesis
and, consequently, it inhibits RANKL-induced NFATc1
expression in virgin preosteoclasts that are previously only
exposed to M-CSF, but not RANKL. However, LPS
upregulates NFATc1 expression in preosteoclasts that are
previously exposed to RANKL. These studies implicated
the role of innate immune system in the regulation of
periodontal bone resorption.

Insights gained from these recent advancements in
the study fields of both adaptive and innate immune
responses, supported by the discovery of RANKL, have
led to the paradigm of immune-mediated periodontal
bone loss, a sound scientific platform from which to
explore novel therapeutics for the amelioration of PD by
regulating immune responses.
