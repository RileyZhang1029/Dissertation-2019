Despite being of high biotechnological relevance, many aspects of organic acid excretion
in ﬁlamentous fungi like the inﬂuence of ambient pH are still insufﬁciently understood.
While the excretion of an individual organic acid may peak at a certain pH value, the few
available studies investigating a broader range of organic acids indicate that total organic
acid excretion rises with increasing external pH. We hypothesized that this phenomenon
might be a general response of ﬁlamentous fungi to increased ambient pH. If this is the
case, the observation should be widely independent of the organism, growth conditions,
or experimental design and might therefore be a crucial key point in understanding the
function and mechanisms of organic acid excretion in ﬁlamentous fungi. In this study we
explored this hypothesis using ammonium-limited chemostat cultivations (pH 2–7), and
ammonium or phosphate-limited bioreactor batch cultivations (pH 5 and 7). Two strains of
Penicillium ochrochloron were investigated differing in the spectrum of excreted organic
acids. Conﬁrming our hypothesis, the main result demonstrated that organic acid excretion
in P. ochrochloron was enhanced at high external pH levels compared to low pH levels inde-
pendent of the tested strain, nutrient limitation, and cultivation method. We discuss these
ﬁndings against the background of three hypotheses explaining organic acid excretion in
ﬁlamentous fungi, i.e., overﬂow metabolism, charge balance, and aggressive acidiﬁcation
hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION
Although commercial organic acid production with ﬁlamentous
fungi is of increasing biotechnological importance (Sauer et al.,
2008), many aspects of organic acid excretion are still poorly
understood. This is partly due to the multitude of inﬂuencing
factors such as small changes in medium composition (e.g., sugar
concentration, presence or absence of trace elements, phosphate
or ammonium limitation) or cultivation conditions (e.g., aera-
tion, agitation, pH). To complicate matters further, the inﬂuence
of these factors often varies substantially between organisms and
strains (Kristiansen et al., 1982; Gradisnik-Grapulin and Legisa,
1996).

Ambient pH strongly inﬂuences growth and organic acid excre-
tion in ﬁlamentous fungi. When grown in an unbuffered medium,
ﬁlamentous fungi often rapidly acidify their environment to very
low and even sometimes detrimental pH values (Magnuson and
Lasure, 2004). The major mechanism behind this acidiﬁcation is
controversially discussed, but is most often attributed to either
organic acid excretion (Magnuson and Lasure, 2004; Andersen
+
et al., 2009) or proton release by the plasma membrane H
-ATPase
(Sanders, 1988; Jernejc and Legisa, 2001). From a biotechnolog-
ical point of view, however, ambient pH is an important process
parameter, e.g., in Aspergillus niger maximal citric acid production
occurs below pH 2 (Papagianni, 2007), gluconic acid production
at pH 4.5–6.5 (McCullough et al., 1986) and oxalic acid excretion
above pH 5 (Ruijter et al., 1999).

The excretion of a single organic acid may peak at a certain
pH value, whereas the total amount of excreted organic acids
seems to follow a different progress, although systematic inves-
tigations of this phenomenon for a broader range of organic acids
are scarce. The only two available studies on this subject, namely
on Neurospora crassa (Slayman et al., 1990; C. L. Slayman and P.
Kaminski, unpublished results, Figure 1 with kind permission)
and A. niger (Andersen et al., 2009), indicate that total organic
acid excretion increases with rising pH despite huge differences
in experimental conditions (i.e., pH-stat incubation with non-
growing hyphae versus bioreactor batch cultures). We therefore
hypothesized that this phenomenon might be a general response
of ﬁlamentous fungi to increased ambient pH. If this hypothesis
is correct then this observation should be widely independent of
the organism, growth conditions, or experimental design. Further-
more, if this is a general response of ﬁlamentous fungi to ambient
pH, these ﬁnding might be a crucial key point in understanding the
function and mechanisms of organic acid excretion in ﬁlamentous
fungi.

This work draws on these two previous studies and explores our
hypothesis using two Penicillium ochrochloron strains which differ
in the spectrum of excreted organic acids. Experiments comprised
ammonium-limited chemostat cultivations ranging from pH 2 to
7 and ammonium or phosphate-limited bioreactor batch experi-
ments with high sampling frequency at pH 5 and 7. P. ochrochloron
is a heavy metal-resistant fungus (Tuthill et al., 2001) and was used

(Tuthill et al., 2001). The ﬁrst strain, P. ochrochloron CBS 123823,
an isolate from the soil of the copper works Montanwerke Brixlegg
(Tyrol, Austria) in 1986, was incorrectly identiﬁed in 1989 by the
Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, The Netherlands) as
Penicillium simplicissimum (Franz et al., 1991). The second strain,
P. ochrochloron CBS 123824 emerged from the wild type strain
CBS 123823 over 20 years of passaging on rye. Both strains were
recently re-identiﬁed by three independent institutions as the close
related species P. ochrochloron (Vrabl et al., 2008).

PRECULTURES
All bioreactors were inoculated with ﬁlamentous mycelium pre-
grown in a HEPES–glucose medium for 60 h as previously
described (Gallmetzer et al., 1998).

BIOREACTOR CHEMOSTAT EXPERIMENTS
Chemostat experiments were performed in a Biostat M bioreactor
(Sartorius/Braun, working volume of 1.7 L, bioreactor equipped
with an overﬂow device) under ammonium limitation (medium
composition see Gallmetzer and Burgstaller, 2002; cultivation con-
ditions as described in Gallmetzer and Burgstaller, 2001). For
pH-shift experiments the culture pH was raised stepwise (Gall-
metzer, 2000): starting with an initial pH of 2, the culture pH
was adjusted with sodium hydroxide to the desired next pH level
(pH 4, 6, and 7). The chemostat cultures typically reached a new
steady state (assumed with onset of constant oxygen consumption
and biomass concentration) after passing four to six generation
times following a shift in pH. Once a steady state was established,
samples were withdrawn regularly from the bioreactor over a min-
imum time period of 30 h (at least four sampling points; for each
sampling point three samples were taken and averaged) to mon-
itor residual glucose concentration, organic acid production, and
biomass concentration.

BIOREACTOR BATCH EXPERIMENTS
Prior to inoculation to the bioreactor, the preculture was har-
vested under sterile conditions by ﬁltration (0.2 μm, cellulose
acetate) and washed with approximately 200 mL sterile distilled
water. The mycelial cake was transferred aseptically to the biore-
actors (either Biostat M, Sartorius/Braun, Melsungen, Germany
or KLF 2000 Bioengineering, Wald, Switzerland). Both bioreac-
tors were operated with a working volume of 1.7 L. Equipment
and culture conditions were according to Vrabl et al. (2008, 2009).
The pH was kept constant with 1 M sodium hydroxide. External
pH and dissolved oxygen tension were monitored with an online
data acquisition system (Fa. Gatterbauer Messtechnik, Sipbachzell,
Austria).

The medium for bioreactor batch cultivation was a modiﬁed
preculture medium and concentrations are the same for ammo-
nium and phosphate-limited conditions unless stated otherwise

(average length ∼300 μm) were grown in shaking ﬂasks cultures,
harvested, washed, and transferred to a pH-stat at 25˚C (resuspension

titrated to a deﬁned pH between 4 and 9. Samples were taken after 40 min
and analyzed via gas chromatography. The amount of excreted organic acid
anions roughly matched the calculated H+-release. Methods and data

MATERIALS AND METHODS
ORGANISM AND STRAINS
In this work we used two different strains of P. ochrochloron, a fun-
gus, which is known to tolerate high heavy metal concentrations

element solution was added after sterilization via ﬁltration. Prior
to inoculation, the pH was adjusted with 1 M sodium hydroxide
to either pH 5 or 7. Each nutrient limitation was performed with
both strains at pH 5 and 7. All conditions were performed at least
in triplicates, except for strain CBS 123824 the phosphate limita-
tion at pH 5 was performed in duplicate. The single experiments
were limited by the small working volume (1.7 L) of the bioreac-
tors. To disturb the cultivations as little as possible by the high
sampling frequency, only one sample per time point was taken.
Samples (10 mL) were withdrawn from the bioreactor at regu-
lar time intervals and immediately ﬁltrated (cellulose acetate ﬁlter,
pore size 0.45 μm). The mycelial cake was used for dry weight esti-
mation. The ﬁltrate was rapidly aliquotated into Eppendorf tubes
and frozen in a cold bath (−40˚C; Frykatherm) for later analysis
of extracellular organic acids and residual nutrient concentrations.
Cultivations were monitored at least for 40 h after inoculation.

pH TRANSIENTS
A phosphate-limited culture with the strain CBS 123824 was
started at a pH of 7. Without sodium hydroxide titration overnight,
the fungus acidiﬁed the medium during the lag and exponential
phase until the next morning. From then the pH was kept con-
stant at pH 5 throughout the experiment. These experiments were
performed twice.

ANALYTICS
Extracellular nutrient and organic acid concentrations were deter-
mined in culture ﬁltrates, which were diluted prior to analysis
if necessary. Glucose was measured with a Megazyme Test Kit
for d-Glucose (GOPOD Format, K-GLUC, Megazyme Interna-
tional Ireland Ltd., Wicklow, Ireland), ammonium according to
the macroscale method of Rhine et al. (1998) and phosphate as
described by Illmer (1996). Organic acids were determined accord-
ing to Womersley et al. (1985) on a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H
column with 4 mN sulfuric acid as mobile phase, a temperature of
−1. Dry weight was estimated
41˚C and a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL min
as previously described (Vrabl et al., 2009).

CALCULATIONS
Rates for nutrient uptake, organic acid excretion, or sodium
hydroxide titration were calculated by differentiation of the respec-
tive nutrient, organic acid, or sodium hydroxide versus time curves
as previously described (Vrabl et al., 2009).

Although bioreactor batch experiments showed comparable
tendencies, there were slight temporal shifts between parallel
experiments, e.g., caused by small differences in culture history.
These temporal shifts are particularly important when consid-
ering dynamic processes like the short spike in pH shown in
Figure 4 or 6: Averaging such curves can conceal real dynamics and
should be avoided. We therefore depicted one representative (e.g.,
Figures 4 and 5) dataset or all three datasets for each experimental
condition.

RESULTS
This study explores total organic acid excretion in P. ochrochloron
in response to ambient pH with a series of ammonium-limited
chemostat cultivations ranging from pH 2 to 7 and ammonium
or phosphate-limited bioreactor batch cultivations at pH 5 and

7. Chemostat experiments allow the investigation of parameters
at a constant physiological state, i.e., unchanging nutritional con-
ditions, growing hyphae, and constant speciﬁc growth rate. In
contrast, bioreactor batch cultures pass through vastly changing
nutritional conditions (from unlimited to limited up to starva-
tion), speciﬁc growth rates ranging from zero up to μmax and
consequently strongly varying physiological states.

Conditions for the bioreactor batch experiments were cho-
sen for the following reasons: (i) Distinct differences in the level
of organic acid excretion were to be expected between pH 5
and 7 (derived from the chemostat experiments, Figure 2). (ii)
Ammonium- or phosphate-limited conditions were known to lead
to the most pronounced organic acid excretion in P. ochrochloron,
and furthermore, differ in the spectrum of excreted organic acids
(Gallmetzer and Burgstaller, 2002). (iii) All bioreactor batch exper-
iments were performed with two different P. ochrochloron strains
which were known to strongly differ in the spectrum of excreted
organic acids (as demonstrated in Figure 3).

OVERALL FINDINGS
Under all tested conditions, total organic acid excretion in
P. ochrochloron increased with rising external pH. This obser-
vation was independent whether the fungus was grown under
ammonium-limited conditions in a chemostat between pH 2 and
7 (Figure 2) or in highly dynamic bioreactor batch cultivations
under ammonium or phosphate-limited conditions (Figures 3–5).

for the depicted data were for (A) pH 5 at 41.8± 1.38 h and pH 7 at

of cultivation, (C) pH 5 at 35.0± 0.65 h and pH 7 at 34.33± 0.88 h of

cultivation. Data are means of three independent bioreactor batch cultivations
(single curves see Figures 4–6), except phosphate-limited cultures of strain
CBS123824 at pH 5 (D), which were performed twice.

In contrast, the spectrum of excreted organic acids varied strongly
with pH, strain and nutrient limitation: While oxalate and citrate
were the predominant organic acids of the strain CBS 123823 of
both nutrient limitations at pH 7 (Figures 3A,C), solely citrate was
excreted in considerable amounts at pH 5. In strain CBS 123824
malate was the main excreted organic acid during ammonium-
limited batch cultures at pH 7, whereas at pH 5 succinate and
malate were predominant (Figure 3B). The same strain excreted
mainly citrate during phosphate limitation (Figure 3D).

In addition to cultivations at pH 5 and 7, phosphate-limited
cultures of the strain CBS 123824 were exposed to a transient in
pH from pH 7 to 5 during the lag and exponential phase, i.e., start-
ing with an initial pH of 7, the fungus was allowed to acidify the
medium until reaching pH 5 which was kept constant until the
end of cultivation. In these experiments the amount of excreted
organic acids was in the magnitude of cultivations at pH 5 (data
not shown).

DETAILED DYNAMICS OF THE BIOREACTOR BATCH EXPERIMENTS
In contrast to chemostat studies, bioreactor batch experiments
depict complex nutritional and physiological changes. Because
both strains showed comparable dynamics (Figures 4 and 5),
we demonstrate the main ﬁndings with the P. ochrochloron strain
CBS 123823, i.e., the strain which excretes more organic acids (as
demonstrated in Figure 3). At any pH P. ochrochloron excreted
organic acids during the whole cultivation, i.e., low amounts

of organic acids were excreted during exponential growth but
the excretion was strongly enhanced on depletion of either
ammonium or phosphate (exception see Unusual Findings).

The course of ammonium or phosphate uptake in ammonium-
limited cultures (Figure 4A) did not signiﬁcantly differ between
pH 5 and 7 (note that phosphate uptake more or less halted after
ammonium had been exhausted). In contrast to ammonium and
phosphate, glucose was consumed faster at pH 7 than at pH 5
despite a lower biomass concentration at pH 7 (Figure 4A). This
is also reﬂected in a decreasing biomass yield on glucose with
increasing pH (Table 1).

In phosphate-limited cultures at pH 5 (Figure 5A), P.
ochrochloron utilized ammonium considerably faster than at pH 7,
leading surprisingly to an early double limitation. Thus, biomass
at pH 5 and 7 remained approximately at the same level. Similar to
ammonium-limited experiments, the course of phosphate uptake
did not differ between pH 5 and 7. When measuring the glucose
concentrations of phosphate-limited cultures, we often observed
an extreme scattering of the values, especially at pH 7. This scatter-
ing was independent of the analytical method, i.e., photometrical
assay or HPLC, or the bioreactor used. Interestingly we did not
observe this problem with any ammonium-limited experiment,
although sampling and sample preparation were the same. From
experiments with less scattering such as depicted in Figure 5, the
glucose consumed per g dry weight seemed to be almost in the
same order of magnitude.

independent experiments from one speciﬁc time point of cultivation is

cultivation).

UNUSUAL FINDINGS
The pH was kept constant with sodium hydroxide throughout
all cultivations, because we expected only an acidiﬁcation of the
medium in these early stages. Surprisingly the external pH shortly
increased in ammonium-limited cultures of the strain CBS 123823
at pH 5 after exhaustion of ammonium (Figure 4C). This effect
was even more distinct with the strain CBS 123824 (Figure 6A).
In this strain the short spike in pH after exhaustion of ammonium
was followed by a wavelike sequence of increases and decreases.

Although glucose was present in excess at this time, some
organic acids seemed to be reutilized (Figure 6B): While citrate
and fumarate seemed to be almost completely taken up, oxalate

excretion increased steadily (data for oxalate not shown). On the
other hand, pyruvate, malate, and succinate (data for succinate
not shown) remained on the same level or followed a wavelike
progress. Likewise, the strain CBS 123823 occasionally seemed
to reutilize organic acids (e.g., pyruvate in Figure 4B) despite
extracellular abundance of glucose.

pH – irrespective of the mode of cultivation (chemostat, batch cul-
tivation), nutrient limitation (ammonium, phosphate limitation),
or strain (Figures 2–5). As far as we are aware, only two other stud-
ies address this topic for a broader range of organic acids, i.e., a
pH-stat study of N. crassa (Slayman et al., 1990; C. L. Slayman and
P. Kaminski, unpublished results, Figure 1 with kind permission)
and a bioreactor batch study of A. niger (Andersen et al., 2009).
Both studies observe increasing organic acid excretion with rising
external pH.

Apparently this observation holds true despite huge differences
in experimental setting (e.g., time frame, cultivation mode, or
nutrient limitation) or physiological status of the mycelia (e.g.,

chemostat mycelium growing at a deﬁned speciﬁc growth rate ver-
sus batch cultures at varying growth rates or non-growing hyphae
in a pH-stat). This conﬁrms our hypothesis that this observation
might be very well a general response of ﬁlamentous fungi to
increased ambient pH. It could thus provide a key point in under-
standing the function and mechanisms of organic acid excretion
in these organisms.

The physiological reason behind this phenomenon still remains
unclear and becomes particularly intriguing when one considers
the comparably high metabolic costs involved in organic acid pro-
duction. Why would total organic acid excretion be increased at
higher pH levels at all?

One possible explanation is that at higher pH levels the gly-
colytic ﬂux is elevated and leads as a consequence of energy
spilling mechanisms to enhanced level of organic acid excretion
(theoretical details on the “overﬂow metabolism hypothesis” see
Box 1). In P. ochrochloron, the data suggest an elevated glycolytic
ﬂux at higher pH levels (present study; Gallmetzer, 2000). Similar
results can be found for other ﬁlamentous fungi, for instance, glu-
cose uptake rates increase with external pH in A. niger (Mischak
et al., 1984; Torres et al., 1996) and in Trichoderma harzianum
(Delgado-Jarana et al., 2003). In the latter study the authors, how-
ever, observed a slight decrease in glucose uptake at pH 6 compared
to pH 5. Also decreased yields on glucose at higher pH levels
(Table 1) hint in this direction and are frequently reported (e.g.,
current study, Pitt and Bull, 1982; Andersen et al., 2009).

A second possible explanation for increased organic acid pro-
duction at high external pH is that organic acid anion excretion
serves as charge balance mechanism (theoretical details on the
“charge balance hypothesis” see Box 2). In literature there is some
experimental evidence for an electrical compensation of proton
efﬂux via organic anion excretion, e.g., in non-growing and mul-
tiple starved hyphae of N. crassa (personal communication C. L.
Slayman), the proton efﬂux was almost matched by organic anion
excretion (Slayman et al., 1990; Rivetta et al., 2011). Roos and
+
Luckner (1984) reported for P. cyclopium that as long as NH
+
4
was present in the medium, NH
4 uptake provided the neces-
sary charge balance for proton efﬂux via the plasma membrane
+
H
-ATPase with a 1:1 stoichiometry. After NH
4 was exhausted,
however, charge balance for proton efﬂux was ensured by the
stoichiometric excretion of organic acid anions. A stoichiomet-
ric relationship between ammonium uptake and proton release
(or sodium hydroxide titration) has also been reported for several
other fungi (e.g., Mattey, 1992; Burgstaller et al., 1994).

+

A third possible explanation for increased organic acid excre-
tion at higher pH levels originates from a hypothesis of Andersen
et al. (2009) for A. niger. The authors suggest that fungi excrete at
high external pH more protons (in form of organic acids) to acidify
the environment and to outcompete rivals (theoretical details on
the “aggressive acidiﬁcation hypothesis” see Box 3). Simulations
predicted oxalic acid as the major source of protons at pH levels
above pH 3 for strains which are able to excrete all organic acids.

In this context three issues are of special interest. Firstly, some
authors attribute the major mechanism behind medium acidi-
+
ﬁcation to proton release by the plasma membrane H
-ATPase
(e.g., Sanders, 1988; Jernejc and Legisa, 2001) and not to organic
acid excretion. The latter would require the transport of fully
protonated organic acids across the plasma membrane which is
questionable (in depth discussion in “Are Organic Acids Excreted
as Anions or Fully Protonated?”). Secondly, in P. ochrochloron but
also in other fungi, medium acidiﬁcation seems to be at least
partly a matter of the N-source. When ammonium is present
as sole N-source, P. ochrochloron rapidly acidiﬁes the medium
to very low pH values (Burgstaller et al., 1994), but not when
nitrate is the sole N-source (although organic acids were excreted
at the same time; Vrabl, Schinagl, and Burgstaller unpublished
results). Similar observations have been reported for other ﬁla-
mentous fungi including A. niger: External pH typically decreases
in cultures with ammonium as N-source, but on other N-sources
like nitrite or glutamate a slower acidiﬁcation or even an alka-
linization of the medium can be observed (Usami, 1978; Amrane
et al., 1999; Jernejc and Legisa, 2001). Thirdly, whilst the model
explained the experimental data for A. niger very well (Ruijter
et al., 1999; Andersen et al., 2009), it does not seem to apply to
the data available from P. ochrochloron (e.g., Figures 2 and 3).
For example, oxalic acid was the predominant acid for the strain
CBS 123823 only at pH 7 and never for the strain CBS 123824,
although both strains are capable of excreting all organic acids.
Citric acid was excreted at both pH levels. It was even the pre-
dominant excreted organic acid for strain CBS 123823 at pH 5
(Figures 3A,C) and for phosphate-limited cultures of strain CBS
123824 at pH 7 (Figure 3D). These results indicate that oxalic
acid is not the major source of protons in P. ochrochloron. Thus
in P. ochrochloron the shift in the spectrum of excreted organic
acids has to have other reasons than to most efﬁciently acid-
ify the medium and might be explained as a consequence of
changes in cytoplasmatic pH. Although ﬁlamentous fungi keep
their cytoplasmatic pH surprisingly stable over a broad range
of external pH, the cytoplasmatic pH is not entirely unaffected
and changes slightly (Hesse et al., 2002). Because the activity of
several enzymes is very sensitive to changes between pH 6 and
7 (Mattey, 1992), a shift in external pH can cause a shift in

Organic acid excretion in response to ambient pH

Box 1 Overﬂow metabolism hypothesis.The term was coined
by Foster (1949) for ﬁlamentous fungi. Neijssel andTempest elab-
orated the hypothesis and expanded it to bacteria (Tempest and
Neijssel, 1992). Organic acid excretion is regarded as one of sev-
eral mechanisms to spill energy when growth is limited by a
non-carbon nutrient and the carbon source is in excess. Various
sub-hypotheses differ in the location of the bottleneck (glycoly-
sis,TCA cycle, respiratory chain). Overﬂow metabolism was often
found to be linked with an increased glycolytic ﬂux (Mattey, 1992;
Papagianni et al., 1999; Karaffa and Kubicek, 2003; Papagianni,
2007).

Box 2 Charge balance hypothesis. The excretion of organic
acids as anions is regarded to be the main charge compensating
ion ﬂux for proton excretion via the H+-ATPase when proton return
via proton/substrate symports is hindered.This avoids a detrimen-
tal hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane (Gradmann et al.,
1978). At low external pH the majority of excreted protons return
into the cell via proton symport of nutrients. At high external pH –
especially when excreted protons are neutralized with sodium
hydroxide – proton return is impaired and another charge com-
pensating ion ﬂux must occur. Excretion of organic acid anions
can balance proton efﬂux more ore less stoichiometrically (Con-
way and Brady, 1950; Sanders, 1988; Slayman et al., 1990; Sigler
and Höfer, 1991; Burgstaller et al., 1994).

Box 3 Aggressive acidiﬁcation hypothesis. This hypothesis
states that “A. niger strives to produce – at a given pH – the
organic acid that most efﬁciently acidiﬁes the medium” to out-
compete rivals (Andersen et al., 2009). Strains, which are able
to produce all organic acids, are said to preferably excrete oxalic
acid. Citric acid was predicted to be the next best acid for acidi-
ﬁcation when oxalic acid could not be produced. This hypothesis
assumes organic acids to be transported completely protonated
(i.e., uncharged) across the plasma membrane so that in this sce-
nario organic acids would be the major source for extracellular
acidiﬁcation. The hypothesis was derived from a stoichiometric
model of A. niger metabolism and acid production, optimized for
maximal proton generation.

enzyme activity and thus also a shift in the spectrum of excreted
organic acids.

Evidently, in each of the three above mentioned explanations
organic acid excretion fulﬁlls a completely different metabolic
function. Moreover, the assumption on how organic acids are
transported across the plasma membrane is mutually exclusive
concerning the charge balance hypothesis (transport of organic
acid anions) and the aggressive acidiﬁcation hypothesis (trans-
ported fully protonated). We will therefore consider this topic in
more detail in the following section.

ARE ORGANIC ACIDS EXCRETED AS ANIONS OR FULLY PROTONATED?
The charge balance hypothesis and the aggressive acidiﬁcation
hypothesis differ in their assumption on which organic acid species

Organic acid excretion in response to ambient pH

are transported across the plasma membrane. This is of partic-
ular interest when one considers the question, if organic acids
are the major source of protons for ambient acidiﬁcation or not.
The charge balance hypothesis requires excretion of organic acid
anions. Thus, depending on the degree of deprotonation and the
ambient pH, organic acid anions would contribute only little. In
contrast, the aggressive acidiﬁcation hypothesis postulates organic
acids to be excreted fully protonated (Andersen et al., 2009), and
consequently, to contribute strongly to the medium acidiﬁcation.
So far, experimental data on the transported species of organic
acids are scarce (Rivetta et al., 2011), but there is a signiﬁcant argu-
ment in favor of anions as the transported species (Mattey, 1977;
Roos and Luckner, 1984; Burgstaller, 2006; Rivetta et al., 2011). The
cytoplasmic pH is around neutral (Hesse et al., 2002) or, maybe,
slightly more acidic near the interior surface of the plasma mem-
brane (Roos and Slavik, 1987). Considering the pK a values of the
organic acids and the cytoplasmic pH it follows that organic acids
are almost completely in their anionic forms in the cytoplasm.
Inversely, the concentrations of fully protonated organic acids are
extremely low (Burgstaller, 2006; Garcia and Torres, 2011). This
implies that the excretion rates, if calculated from the concen-
trations of fully protonated species, are far too low to explain
the measured excretion rates of organic acids (Burgstaller, 2006).
Taken together, it is unlikely that organic acids are transported fully
protonated across the fungal plasma membrane and therefore they
cannot be considered as major source of protons for extracellular
acidiﬁcation.

What does this mean for medium acidiﬁcation in general? The
+
plasma membrane H
-ATPase is most probably the main source
of protons for medium acidiﬁcation in fungi (Sanders, 1988; Sigler
and Höfer, 1991; Jernejc and Legisa, 2001). Net extracellular acid-
iﬁcation, however, results from an interplay between the excreted
species of organic acids, proton excretion by the plasma membrane
+
H
-ATPase, the extracellular pH, and the extracellular buffer-
ing capacity. Net extracellular acidiﬁcation may thus be similar
whether or not organic acids are excreted fully protonated or
as anions accompanied by protons expelled via the H
-ATPase.
Because the latter is the more probable scenario, organic acid
excretion must serve another purpose (e.g., charge balance, energy
spilling, or chelation of trace elements) than merely acidiﬁcation
of the external medium.

REUPTAKE OF ORGANIC ACIDS IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE
INDICATE AN ADDITIONAL METABOLIC FUNCTION OF ORGANIC ACIDS
Although ﬁlamentous fungi typically tend to acidify their medium
especially when ammonium serves as N-source, we observed a
short uprise in pH after exhaustion of ammonium at pH 5 for
both P. ochrochloron strains (Figure 4 and 6) which might be
explained the reuptake of organic acids (Figure 6). Several studies
report protons disappearing from the medium during dicarboxylic
acid uptake, for example in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sousa
et al., 1992) or Hansenula anomala (Corte-Real and Leao, 1990),
which could be the consequence of a dicarboxylate proton symport
(Corte-Real and Leao, 1990; Sousa et al., 1992). In some fungi like
Candida utilis the transport is repressed when glucose is present
(Saayman et al., 2000), whereas in other fungi like S. pombe the
transporter seems to be constitutively active, even at high external
glucose concentrations (Sousa et al., 1992; Saayman et al., 2000).
This might also be the case in P. ochrochloron. Strikingly, in the
bacterium Salmonella typhimurium the formate transporter FocA
changes its function depending on the external pH, i.e., perform-
ing as an exporter at high ambient pH and as an importer at acidic
pH values (Lü et al., 2011).

In this respect the work of Roos and Luckner (1984) is of par-
ticular interest. After adding [1.5-14C] citric acid to cultures of
P. cyclopium under organic acid excreting conditions (i.e., glu-
cose excess), they found a continuous uptake and excretion of
citric acid. Uptake dominated at later phases of cultivation which
resulted in a net uptake of citric acid. This experiment points out
two very important issues: First, external organic acid concentra-
tions require cautious interpretation because they might be the
consequence of a continuous inﬂux and efﬂux and thus represent
only a net ﬂux. Second, organic acids may serve an additional,
yet unknown metabolic function. Clearly this issue needs more
experimental evidences.
