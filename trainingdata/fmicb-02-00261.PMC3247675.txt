Unicellular nitrogen-ﬁxing cyanobacteria are important components of marine phyto-
plankton. Although non-nitrogen-ﬁxing marine phytoplankton generally exhibit high gene
sequence and genomic diversity, gene sequences of natural populations and isolated
strains of Crocosphaera watsonii, one of the two most abundant open ocean unicellu-
lar cyanobacteria groups, have been shown to be 98–100% identical. The low sequence
diversity in Crocosphaera is a dramatic contrast to sympatric species of Prochlorococ-
cus and Synechococcus, and raises the question of how genome differences can explain
observed phenotypic diversity among Crocosphaera strains. Here we show, through whole
genome comparisons of two phenotypically different strains, that there are strain-speciﬁc
sequences in each genome, and numerous genome rearrangements, despite exceptionally
low sequence diversity in shared genomic regions. Some of the strain-speciﬁc sequences
encode functions that explain observed phenotypic differences, such as exopolysaccharide
biosynthesis.The pattern of strain-speciﬁc sequences distributed throughout the genomes,
along with rearrangements in shared sequences is evidence of signiﬁcant genetic mobility
that may be attributed to the hundreds of transposase genes found in both strains. Fur-
thermore, such genetic mobility appears to be the main mechanism of strain divergence
in Crocosphaera which do not accumulate DNA microheterogeneity over the vast majority
of their genomes.The strain-speciﬁc sequences found in this study provide tools for future
physiological studies, as well as genetic markers to help determine the relative abundance
of phenotypes in natural populations.

INTRODUCTION
Marine phytoplankton, which are dominated by cyanobacteria in
most of the world’s open oceans, are important in global marine
biogeochemical cycles and account for half of global carbon ﬁx-
ation (Waterbury et al., 1986; Goericke and Welschmeyer, 1993;
Liu et al., 1997; Partensky et al., 1999; Scanlan and West, 2002).
The immense genetic diversity of phytoplankton communities has
been revealed through rRNA sequences and genomic sequencing
of cultivated species, as well as large scale environmental sequenc-
ing efforts (Rocap et al., 2002, 2003; Ernst et al., 2003; Venter
et al., 2004; Rusch et al., 2007; Partensky and Garczarek, 2010).
As direct descendents of ancient phototrophs with deeply rooted
phylogenies, it is not surprising that cyanobacteria typically show
a large amount of genomic sequence heterogeneity, even among
closely related species (Zhao and Qin, 2007; Dufresne et al., 2008).
However, the genome diversity among Crocosphaera strains and
populations is an intriguing deviation from that observed trend.
In oligotrophic regions, phytoplankton production is often lim-
ited by nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), and in those areas,
nitrogen (N2) ﬁxation provides an important source of new N
that supports primary productivity (Karl et al., 1997, 2002; Bon-
net et al., 2009; Kitajima et al., 2009; Shiozaki et al., 2010). The

major marine N2-ﬁxing cyanobacterial taxa can be categorized
into three groups based on life-style and morphology: (1) sym-
biotic, including Richelia spp., and Calothrix spp. (2) free-living
and ﬁlamentous, like Trichodesmium spp., and (3) free-living and
unicellular, such as Crocosphaera spp. The two most abundant
taxa of unicellular diazotrophs, as deﬁned by nitrogenase gene
(nifH ) phylogeny, are the uncultivated Group A (i.e., UCYN-A)
and Group B, which is represented in culture by a number of
Crocosphaera watsonii strains. Previously, free-living unicellular
diazotrophs were thought to be relatively minor contributors to
total marine N2 ﬁxation (Capone et al., 1997). However, more
recent studies have reported high abundances using qPCR and
direct cell counts (Zehr et al., 2001; Falcon et al., 2004; Church
et al., 2005a, 2008; Langlois et al., 2008; Moisander et al., 2008,
2010), and measured high rates of in situ unicellular cyanobacter-
ial N2 ﬁxation (Zehr et al., 2001; Falcon et al., 2004; Montoya et al.,
2004; Kitajima et al., 2009; Moisander et al., 2010), demonstrating
that unicellular diazotrophs are often signiﬁcant contributors of
new N in the global ocean.

Crocosphaera strains have been isolated from the Atlantic and
Paciﬁc Oceans between 28˚S and 24˚N latitudes. All isolates are
strains of the species C. watsonii. These strains have important

phenotypic differences with ecological implications, such as the
possible absence of phosphorus scavenging genes in some strains
(Dyhrman and Haley, 2006), and differences in cell size, temper-
ature growth optima, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, and
N2 ﬁxation rates (Webb et al., 2009). It is likely that these differ-
ences affect the way each phenotype interacts with the surrounding
environment. For example, EPS production may alter cell sinking
rates, and has also been shown to have cell-protective properties in
some cyanobacteria (Pereira et al., 2009). The two strains described
in this study have contrasting phenotypes. C. watsonii WH8501,
isolated from the South Atlantic in 1984, has a smaller cell size (2–
4 μm), narrower temperature range, and does not produce EPS.
C. watsonii WH0003, isolated from the North Paciﬁc in 2000, has
larger cells (4.5–5.5 μm), produces large amounts of EPS, and has
per-cell N2 ﬁxation rates approximately ﬁve times higher than the
WH8501 strain (Webb et al., 2009).

Despite differences in phenotype, a high degree of genetic simi-
larity has been observed among Crocosphaera strains. For example,
when comparing a 950 bp fragment of the typically variable 16S–
23S rRNA ITS region, no strain was found to vary at more than
ﬁve of six total variable single base positions (Webb et al., 2009).
Another study examined sequences of ﬁve functional genes in
seven Crocosphaera strains and two large-insert environmental
clones (BACs) and found that all strains and BACs shared > 99%
nucleotide identity for all gene fragments, suggesting that there
is remarkably little DNA mutation accumulation among strains
in this genus (Zehr et al., 2007). A metagenomic study supported
this ﬁnding when similar levels of sequence identity were observed
between environmental sequences and the C. watsonii WH8501
genome (Hewson et al., 2009). Such observations of Crocosphaera
genetic conservation are a striking contrast to non-N2-ﬁxing
marine cyanobacteria genera (Prochlorococcus and Synechococ-
cus) that exhibit a large degree of genomic sequence divergence
(Scanlan et al., 2009; Partensky and Garczarek, 2010). Genome-
wide analyses of those genera have shown nucleotide sequences of
orthologous genes often differ by 20–50% even when comparing
very closely related species (Zhao and Qin, 2007; Dufresne et al.,
2008). The average nucleotide identity of orthologous genes in
pair-wise whole genome comparisons of cultivated Synechococ-
cus and Prochlorococcus species (both within and between genera)
was between 50 and 78%, even in comparisons between species
with > 96% 16S rRNA identity (Coleman et al., 2006; Zhao and
Qin, 2007; Dufresne et al., 2008). In addition, large scale environ-
mental sequencing showed that this degree of sequence variation
is also present in natural populations (Rusch et al., 2007).

Observed phenotypic variation among C. watsonii strains could
be explained by genomic rearrangements such as that reported
from alignment of environmental BAC sequences to the WH8501
draft genome (Zehr et al., 2007). That study also observed trans-
posase genes (the genes responsible for genetic movement in trans-
posons) near rearrangements, hinting at a mechanism for genetic
mobility. More evidence that transposase genes may be impor-
tant in Crocosphaera spp., was provided shortly after the release of
the C. watsonii WH8501 draft genome, when the unusually high
abundance of transposase genes was recognized, and evidence was
found for positive evolutionary selection in a subset of those genes
(Mes and Doeleman, 2006). A more recent study showed that

this was not a culture-based phenomenon by observing expres-
sion of some of those transposase genes in natural Crocosphaera
populations (Hewson et al., 2009).

Transposons are highly abundant mobile genetic elements that
mediate genome shufﬂing within and among all domains of life
(Mahillon et al., 1999; Lander et al., 2001; Feschotte et al., 2002;
Waterston et al., 2002; Goodchild et al., 2004; Filee et al., 2007;
Touchon and Rocha, 2007; Aziz et al., 2010). The abundance
of transposable elements in genomes has been correlated with
both genome size and the frequency of horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), and insertion sequence (IS) elements have been observed
in prokaryotes at frequencies from zero to over 300 per genome,
with proteobacteria and cyanobacteria species containing some of
the highest numbers (Kaneko et al., 2007; Touchon and Rocha,
2007; Frangeul et al., 2008; Stucken et al., 2010). However, many
cyanobacteria species do not have any recognized transposases in
their genomes (e.g., Prochlorococcus), and a study which exam-
ined a small number of cyanobacterial genomes found very low
numbers (median= 1 per genome) even in the genomes which
had transposases (Touchon and Rocha, 2007). More recently,
researchers found high abundances of transposases in the deep
oceans, suggesting they play an important role in microbial com-
munities in a variety of marine environments (Konstantinidis
et al., 2009).

The aim of this study was to compare the genomes of two Cro-
cosphaera strains (C. watsonii WH8501 and C. watsonii WH0003,
referred to hereafter as WH8501 and WH0003 respectively) in
order to answer the following questions: (1) Is the lack of DNA
sequence divergence found in previous studies generalized across
the entire genome? and (2) are there strain-speciﬁc regions in
each genome that can explain the phenotypic differences between
strains?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
WH0003 GENOMIC DNA AMPLIFICATION AND 454 SEQUENCING
A non-axenic culture of C. watsonii WH0003 was grown in
nitrogen-free SO medium (Waterbury et al., 1986, 1988) in poly-
carbonate tissue culture ﬂasks with a 0.2 μm pore-size vent
cap (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) at 26˚C under a 12:12 h
light/dark cycle. Because the cells cannot be directly separated
from their EPS matrix, DNA could not be extracted from cultured
cells using standard methods. Instead, an aliquot of densely grown
cells was subjected to 60 s of bead beating on a Mini-Beadbeater-
96 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA) with a mixture of
0.5 and 0.1 mm beads to physically separate a portion of the cells
from their EPS. After bead beating, the resulting mixture of cells
and EPS was passed through a 10 μm swinex ﬁlter prior to being
sorted using the Inﬂux Mariner ﬂow cytometer and cell sorter
(Cytopeia Corp, Seattle, WA, USA). The ﬂow rate was adjusted to
allow approximately 2,000 events per second during sorting. Repli-
cates of 5,000 cells each were sorted into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge
tubes containing 150 μL of TE buffer, and stored at −80˚C.
After freezing, cells were thawed and pelleted at 14,000 rpm
(21,000× g ) for approximately 40 min and the supernatant was
discarded. Cells were resuspended in 7 μL of GenomiPhi V2 sam-
ple buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA), lysed by
adding 2 μL of lysis buffer (400 mM KOH+ 10 mM EDTA) and

incubating at 65˚C for 3 min. The lysis was terminated by adding
2 μL of neutralization buffer (600 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mM
HCl) and placing the samples on ice. The resulting whole cell lysis
was used directly in a 21 μL reaction by adding 8.5 μL of reaction
buffer, and 1.5 μL of GenomiPhi V2 enzyme mix (Amersham Bio-
sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Ampliﬁcation was carried out in a
thermal cycler at 30˚C for 105 min, terminated at 65˚C for 10 min,
followed by temporary storage at 4˚C, and long-term storage at
−20˚C. Prior to 454 sequencing, ampliﬁed genomic DNA was
quantiﬁed using Pico Green (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA).

Shotgun library construction was carried out at the UCSC
Genome Sequencing Center1 using sorted cell ampliﬁed DNA
and sequenced on the Genome Sequencer FLX instrument using
Titanium Series protocols according to the manufacturer’s speci-
ﬁcations (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA).

WH0003 draft genome (4,553,866 bp or 83.3% coding sequence).
For the WH8501 genome, the existing GenBank locations and
functional annotations for all 5,958 ORFS were used, except for
1,211 ORFs that were identiﬁed as transposase genes and subse-
quently re-annotated with their corresponding IS family assign-
ments (see Materials and Methods and Table S1 in Supplementary
Material).

The WH0003 genome sequences and annotations are pub-
licly available in GenBank2. The Whole Genome Shotgun project
has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the acces-
sion AESD00000000. The version described in this paper is
the ﬁrst version, AESD01000000. The 899 contigs conﬁdently
assigned to the WH0003 have accession numbers AESD01000001–
AESD01000899, and the additional 227 contigs that are “proba-
ble” WH0003 sequences have accession numbers AESD01000900–
AESD01001126.

SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY AND ANALYSIS AND ORF IDENTIFICATION
The 1/2 chip 454 sequencing run produced 540,451 reads, with
an average length of 418 bp for a total of 225,977,489 bp (∼37×
coverage of the genome). All reads were assembled using Version
2.0.00 of the Newbler GS De Novo Assembler program (454 Life
Sciences, Branford, CT, USA). The assembly was run via com-
mand line interface using the “-nrm,”“-consed,” and “-large” ﬂags.
All other parameters used were the default values, as described in
the manufacturer’s publication,“Genome Sequencer Data Analysis
Software Manual.”

The assembly resulted in 1390 contigs, ranging in length from
500 to 46,275 bp with a total length of 6,130,298 bp. Each contig
was compared to the C. watsonii WH8501 draft genome (GenBank
GI #67858163) using nucleotide BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990),
and contigs with over 100 bp sequence alignments to WH8501
were assigned to the WH0003 draft genome. There were 899 such
contigs with a total length of 5,465,610 bp. The remaining 491
contigs that showed less similarity, or no similarity, to WH8501
were compared to a database of all prokaryotic proteins using
BLASTx (translated nucleotide query vs. protein DB), and divided
according to the taxonomy of their best BLAST alignments. There
were 227 contigs (totaling 424,894 bp) which were most similar
to known cyanobacterial sequences. Those contigs were labeled as
“probable”WH0003 genome sequence. The remaining 260 contigs
(237,640 bp) showed no homology to known cyanobacteria, and
were discarded from further analysis.

Features in the WH0003 draft genome sequence were identiﬁed
and annotated using RAST (Aziz et al., 2008). The concatenated
proxy genome was the input sequence, and 5,693 features were
predicted. Those features were annotated as follows; 3 rRNA
sequences (in a single operon), 39 tRNA sequences (71–87 bp
each), and 5,651 open reading frames (ORFs). In order to cor-
rect for the fact that the genome was artiﬁcially concatenated, 618
ORFs which were predicted by RAST to read across the ends of
contigs were broken at the contig ends, and manually re-annotated
using BLAST results of the resulting broken ORFs. This process
produced 762 non-broken ORFs (from the original 618 contig-
spanning sequences), resulting in a total of 5,795 ORFs in the

TRANSPOSASE ANNOTATION
The observation of highly repetitive ORFs in the WH8501 genome,
most of which were annotated as hypothetical proteins, led to a
reassessment of the functions of those ORFs. Using a nucleotide
sequence identity cutoff of 98%, ORFs were placed into isoform
groups, and the number of copies of each isoform was tabulated
(Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Amino acid sequences for
a representative of each isoform were used as query sequences
in a protein BLAST (BLASTp) against all prokaryotic proteins.
Sequences were annotated as transposase genes using the conserv-
ative criteria of a total identity (tID= percent identity× percent of
the ORF length aligned) of more than 50% to known transposases.
Those ORFs, as well as any originally annotated transposase genes
not represented in the isoform groups, were assigned to IS fam-
ilies according to sequence similarity to known families using
the BLAST tool on the ISﬁnder website3 with default parame-
ters (Siguier et al., 2006). All of the re-annotated ORFs are listed
in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. A similar analysis was
carried out on the WH0003 genome. ORFs initially annotated
as hypothetical or unknown proteins were compared (BLASTp)
to all prokaryotic proteins. Sequences with alignments to known
transposases were annotated based on tID as follows; >50% tID:
annotated as “transposase,” 35–50% tID: annotated as “similar
to transposase,” 10–35% tID: annotated as “possible transposase,”
ORFs in all of those categories, as well as those annotated as trans-
posases by the RAST automated annotation were assigned to IS
families according to sequence similarity to known families using
the ISﬁnder BLAST tool (see text footnote 3; Siguier et al., 2006).

GENOME COMPARISONS
To assist in visualization of genome-wide comparison between
the two strains, proxy genome sequences were created by concate-
nating the draft genome contigs into a single sequence. For C.
watsonii WH8501, all 323 contigs were placed in the same order
in which they are listed in GenBank, roughly in order of descend-
ing contig length. The WH0003 contigs were ordered according
to the location of their best BLAST alignment to the WH8501

proxy genome. The resulting two proxy genomes were aligned and
visualized using the WebACT4 version of the Artemis Comparison
Tool (Carver et al., 2005).

Nucleotide sequences for intergenic spaces (IGSs) over 50 bp
and all ORFs from each strain were used as query sequences
in BLASTn comparisons against the proxy genome of the other
strain. The percent identity of the best BLAST alignment for each
sequence (for sequences with alignments≥ 50 bp) were used to
determined shared and strain-speciﬁc genome features as dis-
cussed in those sections below. For the taxonomic analysis of the
WH0003 ORFs least similar to WH8501, sequences were placed
into three bins based on tID of the best BLAST alignment (35–50%
tID, 20–35% tID, and <20% tID). Translated amino acid sequences
for all sequences in each bin were compared to the NCBI nr protein
database using BLASTp. The results of those BLAST comparisons
were used to construct the taxonomic distributions (and likely
origins) of the ORFs using the MEGAN program (Huson et al.,
2007).

MICROARRAY GENE EXPRESSION
Methods for growth, RNA extraction, and microarray design
and hybridization of whole genome expression experiments were
described in Shi et al. (2010). Brieﬂy, C. watsonii WH8501 cul-
tures were grown under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle, and RNA was
extracted at eight time points (four in dark and four in light).
The RNA samples from each time point were hybridized to an
oligonucleotide array designed from the WH8501 draft genome
(NimbleGen design ID 2007-03-14_EW_C_watsonii). A total of
320 oligonucleotide probes representing transposase genes in three
IS families and one putative transposase family (average of 80
probes per family) were included on the array, which enabled the
analysis described in this manuscript. For each gene, the overall
mean expression for all eight time points was calculated, and the
relative expression for each time point was calculated relative to
that mean.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
BROAD GENOME COMPARISON
The genomes of the two Crocosphaera strains (WH8501 and
WH0003) were similar in size, %G+ C, and number of predicted
ORFs. Genomic DNA from the WH0003 strain was sequenced,
assembled and analyzed (see Materials and Methods), resulting
in a draft genome of 5.5 Mb in 899 contigs. There were an addi-
tional 227 contigs (0.4 Mb) that had no similarity to WH8501, but
were identiﬁed as “probable” WH0003 genome sequence, based

on similarity to other cyanobacterial sequences (Table 1). The
total length of WH0003 contigs (5.9 Mb) was similar in size to
the previously sequenced 6.2 Mb genome of the WH8501 strain.
The WH8501 genome is composed of fewer (323) and longer con-
tigs than that of WH0003, despite the fact that the sequence data
was over 35× coverage of the WH0003 genome. This may have
been due to the difference between sequencing methods, since
other pyrosequencing projects have had similar difﬁculties assem-
bling genomes without paired-end data (Goldberg et al., 2006;
Hofreuter et al., 2006; Rothberg and Leamon, 2008; Tripp et al.,
2010). The %G+ C of the two genomes was very similar (37.1%
for WH8501 and 37.7% for WH0003) and both genomes had just
under 6,000 predicted ORFs (Table 1). Genome sequences of other
cyanobacteria have much higher variability in GC content within a
single genus. For example, total %G+ C ranges from 31 to 51% in
completed Prochlorococcus genomes and 52–66% in Synechococ-
cus genomes (Partensky and Garczarek, 2010). Genome size also
varies more within these groups than in the two Crocosphaera
strains (<6% variation), with completed genome sizes (as listed
in NCBI completed genomes5) ranging from 2.2 to 3.4 Mb (up
to 50% variation) in Synechococcus and 1.6–2.7 Mb (up to 56%
variation) in Prochlorococcus.

SHARED GENOME FEATURES
Most coding and non-coding regions of each genome were nearly
identical between the two Crocosphaera strains. Nucleotide BLAST
comparisons of coding sequences (ORFs) and non-coding IGSs
between the genomes revealed that over 80% of each genome
was >98% identical to the other strain at the DNA sequence
level (Figure 1). Below the highest category of sequence iden-
tity, the number of sequences in each bin dropped rapidly, and
for all BLAST alignments over 50 bp, there were very few (∼5%)
sequences between 92 and 97% identical, and none was less than
78% identical (Figure 1). The ﬁnding that most of the two Cro-
cosphaera strain genomes are nearly identical is consistent with
previous results that reported little to no sequence variation among
a number of genetic markers targeting functional genes of culti-
vated strains and natural populations (Zehr et al., 2007). Surveys
of the C. watsonii nitrogenase gene nifH also showed very little,
if any, sequence variation in either the Atlantic (Langlois et al.,
2005) or the Paciﬁc Oceans (Church et al., 2005a,b). Additionally,
16S–23S rRNA ITS sequences for 10 Crocosphaera strains varied
at fewer than ﬁve single base positions in a 950 bp amplicon, and
some strains shared 100% identity in this region that is typically
variable (Webb et al., 2009). This level of genetic conservation

Genomic comparison of two Crocosphaera strains

is particularly notable in phenotypically distinct Crocosphaera
strains that have been isolated from multiple natural populations,
over several decades and from multiple ocean basins.

The genome conservation observed in the two Crocosphaera
genomes described in this study and the previously described
environmental sequences (Zehr et al., 2007) could be explained
using three possible mechanisms. First, the species could have a
very effective DNA replication and error correction system, sim-
ilar to Deinococcus radiodurans (Slade et al., 2009). Second, the
Crocosphaera population could have undergone a relatively recent
global selective sweep as a result of a single strain gaining a trait
that conferred a signiﬁcant advantage over all other strains in
the species. The third possibility is that a recent bottleneck could
have severely reduced the population and resulted in loss of most
genetic variation followed by a global re-distribution of the species
throughout tropical waters. However, with the limited sequence
data sets currently available, it is not possible to establish which
of these three best explains the current observations. Future stud-
ies of genomic sequence variation within and between additional
strains, and among natural Crocosphaera populations would help
answer this question.

The high degree of nucleotide sequence conservation in Cro-
cosphaera strains also contrasts with sequence divergence observed
in the sympatric, non-N2-ﬁxing cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus
and Synechococcus (Rocap et al., 2002; Ernst et al., 2003; Brown
and Fuhrman, 2005; Rusch et al., 2007; Partensky and Garczarek,
2010). Pair-wise, whole genome comparisons of Synechococcus
and Prochlorococcus species as well as metagenomic sequencing

of environmental samples showed a much higher degree of vari-
ation in cultivated strains and in natural populations (Coleman
et al., 2006; Rusch et al., 2007; Zhao and Qin, 2007; Dufresne et al.,
2008). However, such sequence divergence was not seen in com-
parisons of environmental samples to the WH8501 genome (Zehr
et al., 2007; Hewson et al., 2009), nor in the comparison between
the Crocosphaera strains described in this manuscript, which sug-
gests that genome sequence diversity among Crocosphaera strains
is much different than in Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus taxa.

STRAIN-SPECIFIC GENOME FEATURES
While much of the genome of C. watsonii is highly conserved at
the nucleotide sequence level, genetic variation between strains
mostly is present as genome rearrangements, insertions and dele-
tions. Alignments of Prochlorococcus genomes showed that strain-
speciﬁc genetic material is often localized to large islands of
variation (10–90 kb each) that do not have homology to other
strains (Coleman et al., 2006). The sequences in each Crocosphaera
genome that were strain-speciﬁc (10–15% of coding and non-
coding sequences, see Figure 1) were further analyzed to determine
their genomic locations and whether they were localized to similar
islands of variation. Proxy genome sequences were constructed by
concatenating the contigs from each strain into a single sequence
(see Materials and Methods). The BLAST percent identity of each
ORF and IGS from one strain were plotted at the position of the
best BLAST match on the proxy genome of the other strain to
illustrate sequence similarity across the genomes as well as regions
where there was little or no sequence identity (Figure 2). The vast

majority of the nearly identical coding and non-coding sequences
were spread across both proxy genomes, and regions without sim-
ilarity (i.e., strain-speciﬁc regions) occurred mostly in small frag-
ments across both genomes, rather than grouped into large islands.
Because the proxy genomes were both constructed from many

contigs, it is possible that some larger stretches of strain-speciﬁc
sequence were not properly arranged, so their full lengths would
be unknown, but that cannot be assessed without closed genomes.
However, the vast majority of WH0003 contigs contained some
regions that were shared with high nucleotide identity to WH8501;

and yet, even on those contigs, the strain-speciﬁc regions were
consistently small and numerous. This suggests that it is not an
artifact of the genome status, but that a multitude of insertions,
deletions and genomic rearrangements have occurred since the
strains diverged.

The WH0003 ORF sequences that were least similar to the
WH8501 genome were compared to public sequence databases
and were generally most similar to closely related cyanobacteria.
Using a combination of sequence identity and length of BLAST
alignment, the total percent identity [(% ID) multiplied by (% of

sequence length aligned)] to the WH8501 genome was calculated
for WH0003 ORF sequences. There were 930 ORFs in theWH0003
genome with less than 50% tID to the WH8501 genome. A
combined tree of presumed taxonomy (Figure 3) showed that
about 15% of these ORFs (142 of the 930 total), with all tID cate-
gories proportionately represented, could not be assigned or had
no BLAST hits at the MEGAN “MinScore” value of 35 (Huson
et al., 2007). Nearly all assigned bacterial ORFs (672 of 762) were
most similar to known cyanobacteria. Most (34 of 49) of the ORFs
taxonomically identiﬁed as C. watsonii WH8501 were from the

sequence similarity to the WH8501 genome across the entire ORF.

The number of sequences in each bin were as follows: 751 in the
<20% bin; 75 in the 20–35% bin; and 104 in the 35–50% bin. Pie
charts show the relative contributions of the three bins to each

two tID categories most similar to the WH8501 genome, and
most of the remaining sequences (379 ORFs) were assigned to
various Cyanothece spp. (a closely related unicellular N2-ﬁxing
cyanobacterium). Only ORFs from the least similar tID category
were assigned to any species other than Crocosphaera and Cyanoth-
ece, and most of those were assigned to other cyanobacterial genera
(Figure 3). This suggested that most of the WH0003 strain-speciﬁc
ORFs were either horizontally transferred from cyanobacteria, or
were ancestral cyanobacterial genes that have been lost from the
WH8501 genome. The 11 ORFs that were taxonomically similar
to non-cyanobacterial taxa could have been acquired via HGT, or
could be genes that do not have homologs in genomes of other
cyanobacteria sequenced to-date. Because there are many trans-
posase genes in the Crocosphaera genomes and the abundance of
insertion sequences in genomes is positively correlated with the
extent of HGT (Touchon and Rocha, 2007), it is not surprising
that these genomes show some evidence of HGT.

∗∗

Most of the strain-speciﬁc ORFs in both genomes did not
have annotated functions, were transposases, or were redundant
with the functions of shared genes, leaving a relatively small
number of gene functions that could be correlated with pheno-
typic divergence. There were 351 ORFs in WH8501 that had no
BLAST similarity (i.e., no alignments >50 bp) to WH0003 (Table
S3 in Supplementary Material), half of which (176 ORFs) were
transposases (also noted with an
in Table S1 in Supplemen-
tary Material) and ∼100 more were annotated as hypothetical
or unknown function. The majority of these genes showed diel
expression patterns (listed in right column of Table S3 in Supple-
mentary Material) in a previous microarray study (Shi et al., 2010).
The functions of the 71 ORFs with annotated functions (aside
from transposases) are listed in the top two sections of Table S3 in
Supplementary Material. Most of those had an identical or nearly
identical function annotated in the WH0003 genome, suggesting
that the function is not missing from the WH0003 genome, but is
being performed by an homologous gene. There were only nine
WH8501 ORFs with functions not found in the WH0003 genome
(listed at the top of Table S3 in Supplementary Material). In con-
trast, the WH0003 genome had a larger number (609) of ORFs
without BLAST similarity to the WH8501 genome (Table S4 in
Supplementary Material). The majority (370) of those ORFs had
no assigned function, and only 24 were transposases. The func-
tions of the remaining 215 ORFs with non-transposase functions
are listed in the top section of Table S4 in Supplementary Material.
A signiﬁcant portion (57) of those 215 ORFs were annotated with
functions that had no homologs in the WH8501 genome (using
annotated gene descriptions). The observation that the WH8501
genome contains a much smaller number of ORFs without func-
tional homologs than the WH003 genome may be an indication
that WH8501 has lost genetic functionality with the accumulation
of the highly abundant transposase genes throughout its genome.
Based on that observation, as well the larger total number of strain-
speciﬁc ORFs, it seems likely that the WH0003 strain has a number
of genetic capabilities that are not present in the WH8501 strain,
and which may help explain the phenotypic differences between
the strains.

Examination of the two longest WH0003 strain-speciﬁc regions
showed that one is probably involved in DNA processing, and

the other is involved in EPS biosynthesis, which is distinctive of
that strain’s phenotype. The largest region unique to the WH0003
genome was 28.5 kb long and was dominated by ORFs annotated
as hypothetical or unknown (Table S5 in Supplementary Mater-
ial). Five of the seven functionally annotated ORFs were related
to DNA replication or transcription, and the function of one
other ORF (bmgA) is a mobilization protein that plays a role
in HGT. These predicted ORF functions suggest that the region
could provide an aspect of DNA processing not carried out by
the WH8501 strain. The second largest (∼25 kb) strain-speciﬁc
region of the WH0003 genome contained 23 ORFs, a number of
which had annotated functions related to polysaccharide biosyn-
thesis and export (Table 2). Alignment of the two genomes using
the ﬂanking shared sequences (6.6 kb from the beginning of the
upstream contig and 2.3 kb to the end of the downstream con-
tig) showed that the entire 25 kb region has been replaced by
a single transposase gene in the WH8501 genome (Figure 4).
The %G+ C of the 25 kb region is 37.2%, which is very close
to the average for the entire WH0003 genome, and most of the
highest quality blast alignments for ORFs in the region are to
Cyanothece spp., a closely related cyanobacterial species. Thus, this
region does not appear to be a horizontally transferred addition
to the WH0003 genome, but rather a deletion from the WH8501
genome. It is also notable that six of the 15 functionally anno-
tated ORFs in this region had functions that are not found in
the WH8501 genome (indicated by an asterisk in Table 2), and
eight of the 15 had functions (based on annotation or COG sim-
ilarity) related to polysaccharide synthesis and export (shown in
bold in Table 2 and with arrowheads in Figure 4). Those included
three of the ﬁve genes proposed as the core of the cyanobacter-
ial EPS pathway (Pereira et al., 2009); speciﬁcally, the wzx gene
(CWATWH0003_3507), the wza gene (CWATWH0003_3516),
and the wzc gene (CWATWH0003_3517). There are no ORFs
with sequence homology, or even conserved domain similar-
ity, to any of these three genes in the WH8501 genome. The
other two genes in the EPS pathway (wzb and wzy) have
homologs in both strains, which further supports the suppo-
sition that WH8501 once had the ability to produce EPS, but
lost that functionality through one or more genomic deletion
events. Because this region of the WH0003 genome appears to
be important in the EPS production that is characteristic of its
phenotype, it would be a prime target for physiological stud-
ies focused on EPS production, and also as a possible pheno-
typic marker in future studies of cultivated strains and natural
populations.

TRANSPOSASE GENE COMPARISONS
In contrast to the genome similarities between Crocosphaera
strains, the number of transposase genes per genome showed a
six-fold difference with over 1,200 transposases identiﬁed in the
WH8501 genome, and just over 200 identiﬁed in the WH0003
genome. Some of the highest numbers of transposases previ-
ously found in cyanobacterial genomes were 362 and 469 in two
Microcystis aeruginosa strains (Kaneko et al., 2007; Frangeul et al.,
2008), and 260 in T. erythraeum IMS101(Stucken et al., 2010). The
number of transposase genes in the WH0003 genome (220) was
similar in magnitude to those species, but the WH8501 genome

contained signiﬁcantly more than previously reported cyanobacte-
rial genomes (Kaneko et al., 2007; Frangeul et al., 2008). In fact, the
1,211 genes annotated as transposases (see Materials and Methods)
constituted more than 20% of the predicted ORFs in the WH8501
genome, and was far higher than the average of 40 transposases
per genome computed for 630 transposase-containing bacterial
genomes (Aziz et al., 2010).

To further characterize the transposases in the genomes of both
Crocosphaera strains, they were assigned to IS families based on
sequence similarity using IS ﬁnder (Siguier et al., 2006). The result-
ing IS family distributions showed that WH8501 had many more
genes in most families, and the relative proportions of families were

quite different between strains (Table 3). The most numerous IS
families in the WH8501 genome contained many identical copies
of the same sequence, suggesting that their abundance is a result
of widespread replication of those genes (see Materials and Meth-
ods and Table S4 in Supplementary Material). For instance, of the
294 ORFs assigned to the IS5 family 283 are isoforms of the same
sequence, and for the IS1380 family, 119 of 120 ORFs are isoforms
of the same sequence. Such replication may partly explain the
disparity in transposase abundance between the genomes, as these
genes were not highly replicated in the WH0003 genome (Table 3).
However, it was not clear why transposases in the same IS fami-
lies, and even with similar sequences have not undergone similar

aThese ORFs were not included in those re-annotated in the WH8501 genome
because they could not be assigned with conﬁdence to an IS family.

levels of replication in the WH0003 strain. Because homologous
recombination can be enhanced between multi-copy IS elements
(Touchon and Rocha, 2007), it is likely that WH8501 has under-
gone more genomic recombination compared to WH0003, but
that is difﬁcult to assess without ﬁnished genome sequences. The
differing patterns of IS family abundance and replication between
the genomes suggests that there are strain-distinct mechanisms of
regulating IS element activity.

The large number of transposase genes in WH8501 may have
resulted from genome assembly error or from the strain being
maintained in culture for a relatively long time. At the time of

genome sequencing, WH8501 had been continuously cultivated
for 20 years, but WH0003 was in culture for less than half that
time (∼9 years) when its genome was sequenced. However, recent
metatranscriptome data has shown that some of the transposases
found in the WH8501 genome were actively transcribed in nat-
ural Crocosphaera populations (Hewson et al., 2009). In addition,
microarray expression data showed that transposase genes in four
IS families in the WH8501 genome are up- and down-regulated on
a daily cycle in culture. The similarity to the pattern observed for
the dnaA gene (Figure 5), which encodes for a DNA replication
initiation protein (Messer, 2002; Zakrzewska-Czerwinska et al.,

Genomic comparison of two Crocosphaera strains

2007) suggests that transposase expression may be coordinated
with DNA replication as has been observed in other organisms
(Ton-Hoang et al., 2010). While more work is required to investi-
gate the full range and activity of transposase genes in these strains,
the available data suggest that transposase genes are actively
expressed in culture and natural populations, and some exhibit
a diel expression pattern.

CONCLUSION
The whole genome comparison of two Crocosphaera strains
revealed that, although the strains have divergent phenotypes,
the vast majority of the two genomes are essentially identical at
the nucleotide level, and only a small fraction of ORFs in each
genome are strain-speciﬁc. ORFs in one of the two largest con-
tiguous strain-speciﬁc regions in the WH0003 genome are likely
to play a role in EPS biosynthesis, and therefore likely to be
important in establishing phenotypic characteristics. Many of the
strain-speciﬁc ORFs did not have annotated functions, and future
discovery of their functions may help further explain the physio-
logical differences between strains. Strain-speciﬁc sequences will
also be useful for studying genetic and phenotypic variability in
natural populations. Both genomes contained an unusually large
number of transposase genes, but the WH8501 strain harbored
roughly six times the number of these genes compared to the
WH0003 strain, and the IS family patterns of the strains were
quite different. Overall, these observations support the conclusion
that Crocosphaera spp., maintain an unusually high degree of
genomic sequence conservation, without accumulating signiﬁcant

nucleotide level mutations, and strains diverge through genomic
insertions, deletions and rearrangements.
