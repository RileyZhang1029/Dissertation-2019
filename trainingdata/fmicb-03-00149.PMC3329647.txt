Burkholderia mallei, the causative agent of glanders, an endemic 
disease in many parts of the world including the Middle East and 
Asia, and B. pseudomallei, the etiological agent of melioidosis, an 
environmental saprophyte endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern 
Australia, are two pathogens with renewed scientific interest. This is 
due to their potential to cause severe infections by airborne trans-
mission, non-satisfying treatment options, but also due to their 
fascinating intracellular life cycle and high virulence in rodents, 
which makes them most promising model pathogens to study basic 
infection mechanisms.

This Frontiers Research Topic is focused on the recent progress to 
understand these two pathogens and their diseases at the molecular 
level, with special emphasis on bacterial virulence mechanisms in 
host–pathogen interactions, and the development of therapeutic 
interventions and vaccines to combat those infections.

In the paper by Allwood et al. (2011), the authors reviewed 
the pathogenesis of melioidosis in the hallmark of B. pseudomal-
lei’s  ability  to  enter,  survive,  and  replicate  within  mammalian 
host cells. The mechanisms used by the bacteria to circumvent 
autophagy and other intracellular defense mechanisms, resulting 
in bacterial intracellular replication and spread to adjacent cells 
with the subsequent formation of multi-nucleated giant cells is 
also discussed.

The  review  by  Lazar Adler  et  al.  (2011)  provides  and  up-to-
date perspective of the in silico, in vitro, and in vivo studies on the 
autotransporter proteins of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. Special 
emphasis is given to BimA, the best characterized autotransporter 
of pathogenic Burkholderia and its role as a mediator of actin-based 
motility; however, the predicted functions of the other autotrans-
porters found in these organisms is also discussed.

Warawa et al. (2011) describe a bioluminescent imaging tech-
nique that permits in vivo investigation of pulmonary melioido-
sis in a murine respiratory disease model. This approach helped 
the investigators to reveal distinct temporal patterns of bacterial 
colonization of the mice organs and permitted the evaluation of a 
capsule mutant, which colonized the upper respiratory tract better 
than the wild type strain.

Since the liver is a commonly affected organ during melioidosis, 
the study by Bast et al. (2011), aimed to investigate the anti-B. pseu-
domallei activity of hepatocytes. The investigators established an in 
vitro hepatocyte infection model to study host defense mechanisms 
against B. pseudomallei, and observed that the bacteria can invade, 
escape the vacuole, and replicate within hepatocytes. Further, they 
determined that IFNγ can restrict growth of the pathogen in these 
cells.

Another area of active investigation focuses in the fact that 
B.  pseudomallei  and  B.  mallei  can  survive  hostile  conditions, 
becoming  resilient  to  many  antimicrobial  agents,  including 
antibiotics.

In the paper by Rholl et al. (2011), the resistance to β-lactams, 
such  as  ceftazidime,  was  investigated.  Genetic  analysis  of  penA 
gene, encoding a putative twin arginine translocase (TAT)-secreted 
β-lactamase, demonstrated that PenA is secreted via the TAT system 
and that this β-lactamase plays a significant role in B. pseudomallei’s 
resistance to these family of antibiotics.

Massey et al. (2011) also took advantage of the bioluminescent 
imaging technology to study the progression of a B. mallei respira-
tory infection in the murine model, as well as to establish the effi-
cacy of antibiotic therapy against this pathogen in real-time. This 
study demonstrated that the B. mallei reporter strain maintained 
similar virulence properties as the wild type strain and allowed 
visualization of the bacteria in the lungs and through progression 
to the liver and spleen over the course of infection. Finally, biolu-
minescence was useful to study efficacy of the antibiotic treatment 
against murine glanders.

The review by Patel et al. (2011) presents a summary of B. pseu-
domallei vaccine development efforts, including a summary of the 
immune responses required for protective immunity, the animal 
models available for preclinical testing of potential candidates, the 
different experimental vaccine strategies which have being pursued, 
and the obstacles and opportunities for eventual registration of a 
licensed vaccine in humans.

In  the  case  of  the  B.  mallei  vaccine  efforts,  the  manuscript 
by Whitlock et al. (2011) describes the global evaluation of the 
genome  of  B.  mallei  ATCC23344  strain  by  expression  library 
immunization for gene-encoded protective antigens. The study 
revealed new putative vaccine candidates, including five candidates 
that were individually tested and found to confer significant par-
tial protection against a lethal pulmonary infection in a murine 
model of disease.

Overall, this Special Research Topic, dedicated to study B. mal-
lei and B. pseudomallei pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches, 
summarizes  the  progress  that  has  been  made  over  the  past  few 
years in this field, and highlights potential opportunities for future 
research. It is evident that understanding glanders and melioidosis 
disease  requires  more  investigators  to  participate  because  many 
areas remained to be understood. With the continue threat that 
represent the use these pathogens as bioweapons and the limited 
options  for  antimicrobial  treatment,  and  no  vaccines  available, 
further research in this field is critical.
