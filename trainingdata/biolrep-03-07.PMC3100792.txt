Abstract
Joint studies that involve biologists and physicists are becoming more frequent and have contributed
to the identification and understanding of physical parameters underlying key biological processes.
Here, we illustrate the main findings resulting from a 10-year collaboration between a cell biologist
and an experimental physicist, both interested in the mechanisms of intracellular transport and
membrane dynamics in eukaryotic cells.

Introduction
Intracellular exchange is the essence of cellular life. For
prokaryotic cells, simple diffusion of nutrients and waste
products suffices. But for eukaryotic cells, whose func-
tional organization relies on an elaborate network of
intracellular membranes (also called organelles), a
complex mass transit system has evolved. It consists of
membrane-bound structures called transport carriers,
of vesicular or tubular shape, that carry cargo into, out
of, and around the cell. Our active interest throughout
the past decade has been in the interplay between
biophysical properties of membranes and specific func-
tions of biological molecules that give rise to in-cell
transport systems.

When we were first introduced in 2000 by Jacques Prost,
a theoretician physicist who was then the director of
the Physics Department at the Curie Institute in Paris
where we both worked, we could not have guessed that
we‚Äôd become such close research collaborators, given
our divergent interests and experience. Yet the encounter
was no coincidence. The Institute was fostering links
between cell biology and physics through a program
called ‚ÄúPhysics of the Cell‚Äù that allocated small cross-
department grants. We quickly realized that the mechan-
isms behind the formation of
transport carriers in
cells excited us both, and enthusiastically accepted the
funding and started our collaboration.

One of us (BG) was an immunologist and cell biologist
by training. From 1986 onwards, Bruno focused on
Rab proteins, a family of small GTPases that regulate
intracellular transport and membrane trafficking. The
year before meeting Patricia, Bruno‚Äôs team, working
with Ernst Stelzer‚Äôs group at the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Germany, had visualized
the highly dynamic process that initiates and moves
membrane tubules along microtubules from the Golgi to
the cell periphery. This novel
transport pathway is
controlled by Rab6, a Golgi-associated Rab [1].

The other of us (PB) was trained as an experimental
physicist in the field of ‚Äúsoft matter‚Äù. Initially, Patricia
worked on lyotropic smectic phases stabilized by
thermal fluctuations. Taking into account the intrinsic
nonequilibrium nature of biological membranes, this
led her to study, in collaboration with Jacques Prost, the
fluctuations of lipid membranes in the presence of active
membrane proteins. Given a growing interest in mem-
brane trafficking, Patricia had known of Bruno‚Äôs stimu-
lating findings on the membrane tubules decorated by
Rab6 before we met.

Assays and models
Almost immediately, we agreed on our joint goal: we
would develop an in-vitro assay that mimics the initial
steps of intracellular transport. In particular, we wanted

to capture membrane deformation and the creation of
tubular carriers. We recruited a student, Aur√©lien Roux, to
work with us. The idea was that Aur√©lien would attach
biotinylated kinesins to the lipid membrane of biotiny-
lated giant unilamellar vesicles, known as GUVs, by
means of 100-nm polystyrene beads coated with
streptavidin (Figure 1,
top). When incubated with
microtubules and ATP in small chambers, GUVs did
indeed give rise to membrane tubes and to complex
tubular networks that could be visualized by confocal
microscopy (Figure 2) [2]. This experiment was the first
demonstration that the force generated by kinesins was
sufficient to pull a membrane tube from a membrane
reservoir. Remarkably, as shown by transmission elec-
tron microscopy, the tubes that were pulled from GUVs
made of EPC (egg phosphatidylcholine) had a constant
diameter of 40 (+/-10 nm), a value close to that
estimated for tubular transport carriers in vivo.

A second student, C√©cile Leduc, was able to monitor the
dynamic accumulation of kinesins at
the tips of
membrane tubes [3], which were collectively respon-
sible for the force generation. For these experiments,
kinesins tagged with steptavidin were directly attached

Figure 1. Formation of membrane nanotubes from giant
unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by molecular motors

to the lipid membrane of GUVs via biotinylated lipids,
following a method developed by the team of Marileen
Dogterom in the Netherlands [4] (Figure 1, bottom).
In parallel, colleagues in the Physics Department had
started to work on theoretical aspects of the physics of
membrane tubes. Their analysis of the dynamics of
motors on both vesicle and tube surfaces fitted C√©cile‚Äôs
experimental observations. Together,
these studies
identified the initial minimal surface density of motors
on the vesicle, below which no membrane tubes can be
pulled [3] and, conversely, a maximum membrane
tension above which motors cannot pull tubes. Extra-
polating this finding to cell biology, transport might be
switched on and off in cells by regulating the number of
available motors,
the number of potential motor
attachment sites (proteins or lipids) on the membrane,
or the tension of the membrane.

Getting physical
Using this minimal model of the early steps of intracellular
transport, we set out to investigate their physical para-
meters, including membrane curvature, membrane bend-
ing rigidity, and membrane tension.

Given the small diameter of the transport carriers inside
the cells (typically 40‚Äì100 nm), they are highly curved
structures in comparison with the membrane from which

a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) containing fluorescent lipids and
pulled by kinesin motors

Membrane tubes similar to those involved in intracellular transport can be
pulled by kinesin motor proteins bound to GUVs that move along
immobilized microtubules in the presence of ATP. The kinesins can be
bound either via small streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (top) or via
streptavidin molecules associated with the lipid bilayer itself (bottom).

they originate, which can be viewed as ‚Äúflat‚Äù. During the
early stages of vesicle formation, protein and lipid sorting
occurs, ensuring efficient and accurate transport between
cell compartments and the maintenance of membrane
homeostasis. In 2004, the sorting of proteins had already
been well described but lipid sorting was much less
clearly understood. To investigate it, we pulled tubes
from GUVs that were prepared from ternary mixtures of
brain sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and dioleylphospha-
tidylcholine (DOPC), representing the three major
lipid components of the external leaflet of the plasma
membrane. Depending on the relative proportion of the
three lipids, the lipids can be either mixed forming a
single homogeneous phase, or they demix and preferen-
tially segregate in different phases. In the latter, two
phases coexist, a liquid disordered phase (Ld) enriched
in DOPC, and a liquid ordered phase (Lo) enriched in
cholesterol and sphingomyelin.

p

The force (f ) required to pull a tube is proportional to
the square root of the bending rigidity (k) and of the
membrane tension (s) (f ¬º 2 Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É2
). Using an optical
tweezers setup coupled to a micropipette system
(Figure 3), we measured the bending rigidity of the Lo
and Ld phases. Membranes in the Lo phase are about
twice as rigid as membranes in the Ld phase [6]. Given
this, we predicted that lipids of the Lo phase should
be excluded from the tubes, to reduce the energy cost to
bend the membrane in the tube. This is exactly what
we observed: in phase-separated vesicles, tubes were
preferentially pulled out from the Ld phase; in homo-
geneous vesicles,
the Lo lipids were depleted from
the tubes. These experiments provided the first direct
demonstration that lipid sorting can occur during the
formation of highly curved membrane tubes [6].

Figure 3. General scheme of the experimental system used to
study forces on a membrane

A membrane nanotube is pulled from a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV)
aspirated in a micropipette (left). A bead (orange sphere) trapped in
optical tweezers is attached to the GUV. The tube is formed by pulling the
micropipette away from the GUV. At equilibrium, the force required to pull
a tube is calculated from the bead displacement and from the tweezers‚Äô
stiffness calibration.

To measure lipid sorting in a quantitative way, another
jointly supervised PhD student, Beno√Æt Sorre, built a novel
experimental setup that combined confocal microscopy,
optical tweezers, and micropipette aspiration. From the
force measurement and from the analysis of
the
redistribution of fluorescent lipids between the tube and
GUV, he could show that lipid sorting was effective only
when the lipid composition of the GUV was near phase
separation. This was done by comparing lipid distribution
in the tube and in the vesicle from GUVs made of different
lipid compositions. Remarkably, this process was amp-
lified in the presence of proteins that are able to cluster
lipids, such as cholera toxin [7]. Our theoretician coll-
eagues developed a model based on membrane elasticity
and nonideal solution theory to explain Benoit‚Äôs results.
This model posits that the sorting of lipids between the
tube and vesicle is determined by a trade-off between
mixing entropy and bending energy. By excluding lipids
that have a tendency to form more rigid membranes, the
energy required to form a curved membrane and thus a
thin tube, is lowered. However, due to the small size of
the lipids, this effect is dominant over lipid mixing
entropy only for compositions close to phase separation
(or demixing) [7].

Lipid-manipulating proteins
Aur√©lien made another interesting observation: when
phase separation of lipids occurred in the tubes, fission
events took place at the boundary between Lo and Ld
domains [6]. It turns out that these observations are
consistent with a theoretical analysis in which mem-
brane rupture was predicted to originate from the
difference of elastic constants of the two phases and
the resulting constricting line tension [8]. Since cell
membranes are likely close to phase separation, these
results raised the interesting hypothesis that the role of
the numerous proteins implicated in sorting and fission
events in vivo [9] could be to trigger phase separation in
membrane lipids, either by clustering specific lipids or by
inducing membrane tubulation.

Mechanoenzymes, including dynamin, are known to
contribute to membrane fission. Dynamin is a large
GTPase that has been shown to polymerize into a
helical collar at the neck of endocytic buds, and induces
the formation of endocytic vesicles through neck
fission. Our work on line tension-induced membrane
fission motivated us to explore the role of membrane
curvature on the helical assembly of dynamin. Using
a combination of confocal microscopy and optical
tweezers, we discovered that membrane curvature
triggers dynamin assembly, and thus the precise
timing for the detachment of endocytic vesicles from
the membrane [10].

The functions of proteins that sense or induce membrane
curvature have received considerable attention recently
because of the importance of this phenomenon during
the formation of vesicles and tubular carriers. Vesicles
are surrounded by coat proteins (e.g., COPI coatomer),
which are recruited to the site by activated coat-
recruitment proteins such as ADP-ribosylation factor 1
(Arf1). Several proteins involved in vesicle formation,
including Arf GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1),
contain a structural motif, named the ArfGAP1 lipid-
packing sensor (ALPS), that senses membrane curvature.
This motif is a nonclassical amphipathic a-helix, whose
polar face, instead of being composed of positively
charged amino acids,
is enriched in serine and
threonine residues [11], a feature that likely explains
the extreme sensitivity of proteins with ALPS motifs to
membrane curvature. As ArfGAP1 is a GTPase-activating
protein, it stimulates GTP hydrolysis of GTP bound to
Arf1, a small G protein located on Golgi membranes.
Arf1 binds strongly in its GTP-bound conformation to
membranes. When this happens, Arf1 promotes the
assembly of the COPI coat on the surface of transport
vesicles operating between Golgi and endoplasmic
reticulum (see Figure 4 and Figure 5). Remarkably, the
ArfGAP1 activity on Arf1 bound to small (highly
curved) liposomes (35 nm) is about 500 times higher
than on Arf1 bound to larger (more flat) liposomes
(150 nm) [13]. Our assay system was ideal for studying
the spatial distribution of proteins between curved and
noncurved membrane regions. Ernesto Ambrioggio, a

post-doc, worked with Beno√Æt to compare the sensitivity
to curvature of Arf1, an ALPS motif, and ArfGAP1. Arf1
bound almost equally well to the GUV membrane and
to a tube pulled with kinesin motors or optical tweezers.
Thus, Arf1 binding is, at most, only weakly sensitive
to membrane curvature. In contrast, ALPS and ArfGAP1
did not bind to the GUV at all. A curvature threshold was
found for their binding to the membrane tubes: almost
no binding was detected on tubes with a radius above
35 +/- 5 nm, whereas below this critical radius, ALPS and
ArfGAP1 density on the membrane increased linearly
[12]. The next step towards understanding the influence
of membrane curvature on ArfGAP1 enzymatic activity
was to investigate the distribution of Arf1 on the vesicle
and the membrane tube in the presence of ArfGAP1.
Remarkably, ArfGAP1-induced GTP hydrolysis was able
togenerate anArf1gradientalongthetube,withArf1density
decreasing linearly from the base to the tip of
the
membrane tube (Figure 4). This nonuniform distribution
of Arf1 along the tube was suggestive of a diffusion-
reaction process: ArfGAP1 activity induces the disso-
ciation of Arf1 from the tube; however, because the
tube is connected to the vesicle (GUV), Arf1 can diffuse
from the vesicle to the tube and this compensates for
Arf1 dissociation. This diffusion-reaction model was
experimentally validated [12]. These finding suggest that
membrane fission is the triggering event
for coat
disassembly. When the neck of the COPI-coated vesicle
is cut, the loss of Arf1 by GTP hydrolysis is no longer
compensated for by Arf1-GTP diffusion. As a result, the
coat should readily disassemble (Figure 5).

Figure 4. Creation of a gradient of ADP-ribosylation factor 1
(Arf1) along a membrane tube connected to a giant unilamellar
vesicle (GUV)

Recently, Beno√Æt has used a similar approach to study
amphiphysin, a protein with a crescent-shaped binding

Figure 5. Proposed model for the association and dissociation of
COPI coatomer in vivo

A gradient of Arf1 molecules (green fluorescent label) is created along a
membrane tube containing lipids (red fluorescent label) pulled using a bead
(large green sphere, right) trapped in an optical tweezers. The gradient is
due to the competition between diffusion of Arf1-GTP from the giant
unilamellar vesicle (GUV) on the left into the pulled membrane tube (green
arrows) and the dissociation of Arf1-GDP induced by ArfGAP1 hydrolysis
of Arf1-GTP, which occurs in the tube because of its high curvature. The
low curvature of the GUV membrane prevents ArfGAP1 binding and
protects Arf1-GTP from hydrolysis.

Coat proteins are recruited to the site of vesicle budding by membrane-
bound Arf1 in its GTP form, and begin to deform the donor membrane.
Sensing membrane curvature, ArfGAP1 is recruited to the budding site
where it hydrolyzes GTP bound to Arf1, which then dissociates. As long as
the budding site is attached to the donor membrane, the GTP form of Arf1
is replenished at the budding site. Once dissociated, the new vesicle lacks a
fresh supply of Arf1-GTP. After all the Arf1-GTP has been hydrolyzed by
ArfGAP1, the COPI coat dissociates from the newly formed transport
vesicle or tubule.

domain called an N-BAR domain involved in the
generation of clathrin-coated vesicles. He showed that
this protein has a dual behavior: at low concentration, its
level on the membrane depends on membrane curvature,
similarly to ArfGAP1, but it cannot deform the mem-
brane. At high concentration, amphiphysin can constrict
a membrane tube,
the membrane
tension (Sorre et al., submitted).

Perspectives
Our collaboration, along with our interactions with
theoretical physicists, has been particularly fruitful
and gratifying over the past 10 years. Right now we are
planning to deepen our partnership still further with an
ambitious project aimed at understanding how different
classes of actin-based motors of the myosin family
function in membrane trafficking and membrane
dynamics. This project will exploit the minimal in-vitro
system developed in our laboratories.

Over the last decade we have challenged one another, and
generated reciprocal interests: Bruno has become more
receptive and interested in physical concepts and Patricia
continues to explore projects more related to cell biology.
What is our advice to others that might be thinking of a
cross-disciplinary collaboration? Go for it, the challenges
and rewards of the alternative perspective will add a new
dimension to you research.
