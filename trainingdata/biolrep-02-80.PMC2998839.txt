Abstract
Despite the recent substantial technological developments in X-ray crystallography, solving and
refining structures at low resolutions remain substantial challenges. Many macromolecular crystals,
especially those of large molecules or multicomponent assemblies, diffract X-rays to resolutions
that are worse than 3.5Å. This report summarizes several recent advances aiding low resolution
crystallographic work.

Introduction and context
While X-ray crystallography can be used to determine
molecular structures at atomic resolution in principle, it
is often not possible because of limitations in crystal
quality. This is especially so in the case of biological
macromolecules. Due to their inherent flexibility and the
relative sparsity of contacts with which to hold a crystal
lattice together,
the highest resolution where X-ray
diffraction data are measurable is often worse than
3.5Å. The Protein Data Bank [1] currently contains 863
entries at resolutions lower than 3.5Å and their number
seems to be increasing rapidly [2].

One might ask why researchers bother to solve structures
that clearly will not yield near-atomic level detail rather
than focusing on projects where such detail can be
revealed? It turns out that a large number of some of the
most important questions that structural biology attempts
to address involve determining how large macromolecules
and their complexes assemble, and understanding how
their components interact. Substantial insight into these
issues does not necessarily require structures at near-
atomic resolution, although if such structures were
possible to obtain they would clearly be much more
desirable. Given that biological interest is focused on large
complexes, the crystallographer often has no choice but to
compromise and accept and deal with the inherent
experimental limitation of low resolution.

The road to a low resolution crystal structure is a difficult
one to navigate, paved with potholes of frustrations and
ambiguities, and it is in sharp contrast to what feels like
driving on a well-lit multilane highway when resolutions
better than 3Å are available; here, progress can be trusted
to automated programs that require less and less human
intervention as technology develops. The principal
difficulty in low resolution structure determination
stems from the limited number of independent (unique)
X-ray reflections. In principle, in order to determine a
structure, one would need at least as many independent
reflections as the number of flexible torsions in the
molecule or assembly [3], so if diffraction data were
available at least to about 5Å, in most cases determina-
tion should be possible. (The exact number varies
depending on solvent content, as this relates to the
sampling density of the molecular transform.) Diffrac-
tion data that are limited to low resolution also tend to
be weak, and therefore the error in the intensity estimates
could be high. Furthermore, data might be affected
substantially by systematic errors such as radiation decay
because experimenters tend to expose their crystals to
large X-ray doses in order to get stronger diffraction.
Since the experimental
information is very limited
compared to the number of degrees of
freedom,
redundancy is minimal or none, and the intensity errors
are especially detrimental. In addition, data quality can
be further compromised if the final data set is the result

of merging partial sets collected on a number of crystals
that may be only approximately isomorphous.

Major recent advances
In some cases, some relatively trivial measures have been
used to improve data quality. For example, in order to
detect reflections beyond 4.5Å in the case of crystals of the
SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) gp12 envelope
glycoprotein, it was important to make sure that a small
beamstop was placed close to the crystal and to move the
detector 400 mm back from it [4]. This served to minimize
the background, as the diffraction limit is basically a signal
to noise issue; most of the noise (which is mainly from
background) is contributed by the diffuse scattering from
the sample and from air scattering of the direct beam.
Large crystal-to-detector distances are especially helpful at
those synchrotron beamlines where the beam has very
small crossfire. In addition, there is the problem of the
series termination errors that give rise to ripples next to real
density features (see e.g., Minichino et al. [5] and
references therein). Also, diffraction that is not isotropic,
with diffraction limits that are dependent on the direction
of the scattering vector, occurs frequently. This situation
can be helped by ellipsoidal truncation and anisotropic
scaling that can, for example, be done on the UCLA
(University of California, Los Angeles) web server [6,7] or
the CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4)
program SCALEIT. The effects of radiation decay in the
data sets can be alleviated by applying the so-called zero
dose correction [8], provided that each unique reflection
was measured a number of times, which may be difficult
to achieve in low symmetry space groups.

The combination of the above sorts of factors will almost
always lead to electron density maps that are noisy and
lacking in detail. In the 4-5Å resolution range, a-helices
appear as tubes and b-sheets as walls of density with no
indication where the individual strands might run. Indeed,
for the latter, the hydrogen bonding between b-sheet
strands is notorious for causing confusion in tracing the
path of the polypeptide chain. Of course, even to see this
much, some kind of phase information is needed in
addition to the intensity data. Unless the macromolecular
assembly is mainly made up of a-helical domains, in this
resolution range a complete de novo structure determina-
tion without known three-dimensional structures of its
components and domains is extremely challenging and in
many cases might be impossible [9]. An important
exception is the class of cases where high-order non-
crystallographic symmetry is available, such as in the case
of spherical or cylindrical viruses.

It is increasingly the case, indeed now very often, that the
three-dimensional structures of
the components or

fragments of the molecule or assembly in question are
already available, and this opens up an avenue towards
generating useful
initial phase information. Modern
automated molecular replacement (MR) programs such
as Phaser [10] or AMoRe [11] can generate good
solutions even when the search model is a relatively
small fraction of the total scattering mass. Also, programs
such as Phaser allow an ensemble of search models to be
used, thus widening the radius of convergence of MR –
an important limitation when only one search model is
used. However, for any MR approach to provide mean-
ingful phase information, a large fraction of parts of the
assembly has to be known three-dimensionally and the
fragment structures should not change much upon
assembly formation.
In favorable cases, a simple
difference Fourier calculated with the MR-based model
phases can reveal interesting and previously unseen parts
of the assembly [12].

Even when MR is able to place the fragments, it remains
extremely desirable to have some experimental phase
information. This may come from a selenomethionine
(Se-Met) multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction
(MAD) experiment, or from heavy atom soaks with, for
example, the Ta6Br12 cluster [13], which is especially
suited for low resolution work on large assemblies. The
heavy atom substructure should then be solvable with
phases computed from the MR solution. Optimizing the
heavy atom substructure and subsequent density mod-
ification can be done with a variety of programs, such as
Sharp/Solomon [14,15], Solve/Resolve [16], and others.

Beyond providing direct phase information,
these
approaches can also independently verify that things
are proceeding well, as the substructure obtained with
the MR phases must be the same (except for a possible
origin shift) as the ones obtained independently (e.g., by
the combined Patterson-Direct methods approach
implemented in ShelxD [17]). The huge advantage of
either a SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction)
or a MAD data set based on Se-Met or Br-dU
(bromodeoxyuridine – if there is nucleic acid in the
structure) is that the heavy atom substructure could
provide further positioning information for the domains
or fragments in favorable cases. However, their phasing
power is often limited at
low resolution. A very
important aspect of even modest quality experimental
phases is that they are free of model bias.

Model bias, which is more serious at low resolution, is
perhaps the greatest caveat in crystallography because the
placed model, in the absence of experimental phases, is
the only source of phase information. As phase
information dominates maps, even an incorrectly placed

or inappropriate model (or both) will inevitably show
up in its own density to some extent when a map based
on model phases is calculated. In addition to the
importance of experimental phases, it is not possible to
emphasize how important the exploitation of real space
redundancies (non-crystallographic symmetry) is, or – if
multiple crystal forms are available – how important it is
to attempt multi-crystal averaging [4]. These effectively
improve the inherently poor data-to-parameter ratio but
assume that the geometrical relationship between the
related domains or molecules can be established.

significant technical advances when dealing with low
resolution single crystal X-ray diffraction data. These may
include the more robust ways to incorporate electron
microscopy or small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering
(SAXS or SANS) information as further restraints. Also, as
one of the most difficult aspects of low resolution
structure determination is the interpretation and build-
ing of models into the electron density,
it will be
interesting to see how far automated processes can be
developed to accomplish these often frustrating and
ambiguous tasks.

In the past, after placing known fragments into their place
and perhaps some rigid body refinement, not much more
optimization could be done. However, there have recently
been a number of important technical advances in this
area. One of these is B-factor sharpening [18], which
involves the application of a negative B-factor to the
diffraction data set. This increases the highest resolution
reflections in the set and can give rise to more detail-rich
maps (e.g., visible side chains) and it is especially useful if
experimental phases are available. Care is needed in
applying this as the weak highest resolution reflections
also have the highest errors and it is likely that by
increasing their contributions the overall noise of the map
will increase as well. The optimum choice is the negative of
the pseudo Wilson B-factor of the diffraction data [3]. It is
also very important to have a reliable bulk solvent model
and to correct for data anisotropy. Previous procedures
that have worked well when high resolution data were
available displayed unstable results for low resolution sets.
New grid search-based iterative parameter optimizations
of the bulk solvent model such as the ones implemented
in the newer versions of CNS (Crystallography and NMR
[nuclear magnetic resonance] system) [19] and Phenix
[20] have successfully overcome this problem.

Quite clearly, any attempt
to do molecular model
refinement at resolutions poorer than 3.5Å has to have
stronger and additional restraints applied to the structure.
Explicit restraints of secondary structure, typically through
some kind of H-bonding potential, are very useful. An
exciting recent development is the incorporation of known
three-dimensional structures of homologues of the assem-
bly investigated through incorporation of a deformable
elastic network (DEN) potential into the target function
used in torsion angle dynamics [21]. DEN allows restrained
but still large-scale deviations from a high(er) resolution
reference structure and this, in principle, overcomes the
main limitation of previous refinement protocols.

Future directions
Given the increasing importance of three-dimensional
structures of large assemblies, one can expect further
