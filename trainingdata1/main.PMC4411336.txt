Introduction

In plants, small RNAs (sRNAs) usually refer to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with
Abstract
lengths of 20–24 nucleotides. sRNAs are involved in the regulation of many essential processes
related to plant development and environmental responses. sRNAs in plants are mainly grouped
into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and the latter can be further
classiﬁed into trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), repeat-associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs), natural
anti-sense siRNAs (nat-siRNAs), etc. Many sRNAs exhibit a clustered distribution pattern in the
genome. Here, we summarize the features and functions of cluster-distributed sRNAs, aimed to
not only provide a thorough picture of sRNA clusters (SRCs) in plants, but also shed light on
the identiﬁcation of new classes of functional sRNAs.

Small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identiﬁed as pivotal regula-
tors in plants, participating in the regulation of plant growth
and development, adaptation to abiotic stresses and responses
to biotic pathogens [1,2]. sRNAs in plants can be mainly clas-
siﬁed into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) [3]. They are processed from the double-stranded
region of
single RNA molecules with hairpin-shaped

secondary structures or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
molecules, respectively, by one of the dicer-like family enzymes
(DCL) encoded by the plant genome [4].

miRNAs are the class of most extensively studied sRNAs so
far, and have been implicated to play essential roles in many
aspects of plant development, such as meristem division, organ
speciﬁcation, leaf shape formation, secondary root elongation,
ﬂowering and fertility [5]. The population of endogenous siR-
NAs in plants largely exceeds that of miRNAs. Increasing lines
of evidence have shown that siRNAs are also important regu-
lators in plants. The RNA silencing phenomenon was ﬁrst dis-
covered in plants as a mechanism to silence invading nucleic
acids such as transgenes and viruses through the action of siR-
NAs [6]. It was later recognized that RNA silencing also plays
important roles in the regulation of gene expression in a wide
range of biological processes [7].

In recent years, extensive studies

focusing on plant
sRNAs have been carried out, especially in the model plant

Arabidopsis thaliana. These studies led to the identiﬁcation of a
few genes related to sRNA biogenesis and functions [5,8,9],
and also new groups of functional sRNAs [10–17]. For miR-
NAs, besides the traditionally-recognized mature miRNAs,
high expression and target-cleavage function were also found
for the isomiRNAs, which are sRNAs produced from the same
genomic loci as miRNAs but with variable lengths, and miR-
NA*s, which are pairing sequences of mature miRNAs within
the same hairpin-shaped precursor [18–21]. On the other hand,
the known functional siRNA classes include (1) trans-acting
siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), which are phased sRNAs produced
from the TAS genes with the involvement of miRNAs and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) [22], (2) repeat-
associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs), which are generated from
transposons, heterochromatic and repetitive genomic regions
[23], (3) natural antisense siRNAs (nat-siRNAs), which are
derived from the overlapping regions of natural antisense
transcript pairs [24,25], (4) cis-acting siRNAs (ca-siRNAs)
produced by the cis-cleavage of TAS3 transcript [14] and (5)
DNA double-strand break induced small RNAs (diRNAs) in
response to DNA damage [16]. Besides the above mentioned
groups, there are also a large number of unclassiﬁed sRNAs
with unknown functions.

With the application of high-throughput sequencing tech-
nology, the population and expression of sRNAs have been
extensively explored in many plant species, revealing some
genomic regions enriched in sRNAs [23]. These genomic
regions tend to produce multiple, sometimes hundreds or thou-
sands of, sRNAs with variable lengths. The cluster-distributed
sRNAs can be grouped into small RNA clusters (SRCs), which
have caught some attention in recent years [26–28]. Studies
have shown that 24-nucleotide (nt) SRCs may contribute to
hybrid vigor in Arabidopsis and maize [29,30]. Moreover, bio-
informatics tools identifying SRCs have also been developed
[18,31]. Here, we summarize the current knowledge and fea-
tures of plant SRCs, as well as the facing challenges, with
the hope to facilitate functional studies of SRCs in plants.

Biogenesis of plant miRNAs and siRNAs

Both miRNAs and siRNAs are derived from the double-
stranded regions of RNA molecules. The difference is that
miRNAs are produced from the double-stranded stem region
of a single RNA molecule with hairpin-shaped precursors,
whereas siRNAs are generated from double-stranded duplexes
formed by two RNA molecules [5]. There are several steps
involved in miRNA biogenesis. Firstly, primary miRNAs
(pri-miRNAs), which are the original transcripts for miRNA
processing, are transcribed in most cases by RNA polymerase
II (RNAPII) [32,33]. In plants, pri-miRNAs are primarily pro-
duced from intergenic regions, whereas a considerable number
of animal miRNAs are encoded by introns of protein-coding
genes [34]. Secondly, pri-miRNAs are processed into precursor
miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) with stem-loop shaped secondary
structures by the endonuclease Dicer-like 1 protein (DCL1)
[35]. This process also requires the participation of many other
proteins, such as the RNA-binding protein DAWDLE (DDL)
[36], the C2H2-zinc ﬁnger protein SERRATE (SE) [37] and the
dsRNA binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1)
[38]. Thirdly, pre-miRNAs are processed by DCL1 into
21-nt double-stranded miRNA duplex in nucleus [39].

The double-stranded duplex of mature miRNA and its pairing
sequence, used to be named miRNA*, are then exported to the
cytoplasm through the action of the HASTY protein, which is
the plant ortholog of exportin 5, and other unknown factors
[40]. Increasing lines of evidence have shown that the miRNA*
sequences of some miRNAs are also functional under certain
circumstances. The miRNA and miRNA* are now more com-
monly named as miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p, respectively,
according to their positions on the hairpin-shaped precursor
[41–43]. The produced miRNA-5p or miRNA-3p will then
be methylated by HEN1 [44], a reaction that protects them
from being degraded by the small RNA degrading nuclease
(SDN) class of exonucleases [45]. Finally, the functional miR-
NA (either miRNA-5p, miRNA-3p or both) will be incorpo-
rated into Argonature (AGO) protein-centered RNA induced
silencing complex (RISC) to execute their functions [46]. Clas-
sically, plant miRNAs usually associate with AGO1 to induce
post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of RNA by pairing
to target sequences and resulting in RNA slicing and/or trans-
lation inhibition [47,48].

On the other hand, siRNAs are generated from dsRNA
duplexes and processed by one of the DCL family member
proteins (Table 1). siRNA precursors include single-stranded
RNA (ssRNA) molecules with near-perfect double-stranded
regions formed by the fold-back of an inverted-repeat (IR)
sequence [49], dsRNA duplexes formed by two RNA mole-
cules with sequence complementarity [24] or dsRNAs con-
verted from ssRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
(RdRPs) [50]. The resulting dsRNA molecules will be cleaved
sequentially into siRNAs, and loaded to AGO proteins of the
RISC complex to execute transcriptional or post-transcrip-
tional gene silencing functions via sequencing pairing [10]. In
plants, siRNAs of different lengths are produced by different
DCL family proteins and exhibit different AGO protein asso-
ciation preferences [13]. Majority of plant siRNAs are 24-nt
long, which are mainly produced by DCL3 and associate
with AGO4 protein [8]. Like miRNAs, the 21-nt plant siRNAs
are mainly produced by DCL1 and associate with AGO1
[51,52], whereas the 22-nt siRNAs are mainly produced by
DCL2 and may function as backups for the 21-nt or 24-nt
siRNAs [3].

SRCs produced from miRNA precursors

Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1993, the importance of miRNAs
has been more and more appreciated [53,54]. With the develop-
ment of high-throughput sequencing technology, many new
features of miRNAs have been identiﬁed.

Mature animal miRNAs are mainly 22-nt in length; how-
ever, majority of plant miRNAs are 21-nt long and this phe-
nomenon is more remarkable among conserved miRNAs
(Figure 1A). Nearly 80% of miRNAs are 21-nt long in
A. thaliana (Ath), which is higher than that in rice and maize
(Figure 1B). According to the biogenesis feature of miRNAs,
high abundant sequence reads should be detected from the
mature miRNA loci of miRNA precursors. For some miRNA
precursors, the pairing sequence of the mature miRNA, either
miRNA-5p or miRNA-3p, will also be functional therefore be
protected from degradation [55]. High abundance of these
mature miRNA pairing sequences has been observed under
some conditions (Figure 1C). According to miRBase release

20, 32.3% mature miRNAs are reported to have their pairing
miRNA-5p or miRNA-3p accumulated. Thus, the presence of
both miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p sequences is also considered
as strong evidence for the identiﬁcation of new miRNAs [19].
Besides the functional miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p, other
sRNAs with variable lengths have also been identiﬁed at or
around the genomic loci of miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p, due
to the imprecise cleavage of DCL enzyme. These sRNAs are
named isomiRNAs [18]. Therefore, two cluster-distributed iso-
miRNAs can be identiﬁed in a typical miRNA precursor,
whereas other regions of the precursor almost have no corre-
sponding sRNAs produced (Figure 1C). This feature is also
a critical criterion to identify bona ﬁde miRNAs [42]. Although
the sequences of isomiRNAs are either shorter or longer than
those of the mature miRNAs, isomiRNAs may share the same
target genes with the mature miRNAs. Nonetheless in some
cases, the isomiRNAs can gain new targets [56]. In addition,
expression variation among different tissues or developmental
stages has also been observed for some isomiRNAs [20]. Under
certain conditions, the expression of certain isomiRNAs can be
even higher than that of the canonical miRNAs [56,57].

Phased ta-siRNA clusters

ta-siRNAs are a class of 21-nt long plant-speciﬁc siRNAs pro-
duced from long dsRNAs [22,58]. Different from other siR-
NAs, ta-siRNAs are derived from the cleavage product of
mRNAs after being targeted by miRNAs [10]. In general,
the binding of miRNAs to speciﬁc target genes (mainly the
TAS family genes) leads to the cleavage of target genes at
the middle of miRNA binding sites [22]. The cleavage product
of mRNAs will be converted into dsRNA by RDR6 and sup-
pressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3) (Table 1). The resulting
dsRNA will be further processed by DCL4 in a step-wise

manner to produce a phased array of 21-nt siRNAs, starting
from the miRNA cleavage site (Figure 2). Therefore, a series
of in-phase produced siRNAs will be identiﬁed from both
strands of the dsRNA duplex converted from miRNA cleavage
product [22]. These in-phase produced siRNAs are termed
ta-siRNAs. Like miRNAs, ta-siRNAs also function by targeting
mRNAs via non-perfect sequence complementarity and induce
target cleavage at the middle of ta-siRNA binding sites [7].
Within the series of ta-siRNAs produced from the same gene,
usually only one ta-siRNA is functional, which has higher
expression than other ta-siRNAs [59]. ta-siRNAs were ﬁrst
identiﬁed in Arabidopsis in 2004 [22], and have now been exten-
sively found in many plant species, such as rice, maize and
Brassica napus [41,60,61]. The sequences and targets of ta-siR-
NAs also tend to be conserved across species. For example, the
50 D7 ta-siRNA produced from TAS3 gene targets ADP-ribo-
sylation factor 3 (ARF3) in both Arabidopsis and B. napus [41].

22-nt SRCs derived from retrotransposons

Although how cells distinguish sRNAs with 1-nt difference in
lengths is still largely unknown, several lines of evidence have
shown that the length is critical for the functions of some
sRNAs. For example, 22-nt long miRNAs that are derived
from the asymmetric duplex region of hairpin-shaped precur-
sors, such as ath-miR173 and ath-miR828 [43], are capable
of triggering the production of RDR6-dependent secondary
siRNAs from target RNAs, whereas the corresponding 21-nt
form of the same miRNA failed to do so [62,63].

The proportion of 22-nt sRNAs in maize is higher than in
Arabidopsis and rice [49,64–66]. Compared to euchromatic
and heterochromatic regions, 22-nt siRNAs in maize are more
enriched in regions encoding retrotransposons, especially
the Copia and Gypsy superfamily retrotransposons [30,67].

These 22-nt siRNAs are usually distributed in clusters on the
maize genome, therefore they can be considered as 22-nt SRCs
(Figure 3). Although the generation of most endogenous siRNAs
is dependent on RDR2 in Arabidopsis [68], a high abundance
of 22-nt SRCs has been detected in the mediator of paramuta-
tion 1 (MOP1, homolog of RDR2) mutant, suggesting that the

biogenesis of these 22-nt SRCs is independent of MOP1 [69].
Systematic studies of siRNAs between two maize inbred
lines (B73 and Mo17) and their hybrid revealed that some
retrotransposon-derived 22-nt SRCs are differentially expressed
between the two parental lines, as well as their hybrid, suggesting
their potential functions in regulating heterosis [30].

24-nt SRCs and their functions

Majority of endogenous siRNAs in plants are 24-nt long,
which are primarily produced from transposons and DNA

repeat sequences, especially heterochromatic regions [49]. siR-
NAs derived from expressed pseudogenes are also mainly 24-nt
long [49]. The biogenesis of 24-nt siRNAs in plants requires
the participation of a plant-speciﬁc RNA polymerase IV
(RNAPIV). RNAPIV binds to the speciﬁc genomic loci

69

through an unknown mechanism to produce ssRNAs [70]. The
ssRNA will then be converted to double-stranded duplex by
RDR2 and further processed into 24-nt siRNAs by DCL3
[71]. In plant, 24-nt siRNAs usually associate with AGO4 (also
AGO6 and AGO9 in some cases) and play roles in RNA-direc-
ted DNA methylation (RdDM) or transposon silencing [72].
Some 24-nt siRNAs, especially those derived from pseudo-
genes, can also modulate histone deacetylation and histone
methylation [11].

Due to the extensive existence of transposons and hetero-
chromatic regions, 24-nt SRCs are the most commonly seen
SRCs in plant genomes (Figure 4). Some 24-nt SRCs can be
quite large, which span long on the genome and contain thou-
sands of siRNAs. Several groups have studied the functions of
24-nt SRCs in regulating heterosis. Groszmann et al demon-
strated that the expression of 24-nt SRCs is remarkably
down-regulated in Arabidopsis hybrids [29]. It has been shown
that 24-nt SRCs derived from transposable elements (TEs) are
often inherited in an additive manner in hybrids, whereas the
expression of 24-nt SRCs associated with protein-coding genes
that function in pathogen defense, abiotic stress tolerance and
secondary metabolism is often down-regulated in hybrids [73].
In maize, 24-nt SRCs have relatively low abundance in peri-
centromeric regions but are highly enriched in euchromatic
regions. These 24-nt SRCs tend to be produced from the
hAT, CACTA and PIF/Harbinger families of DNA transpo-
sons [67]. These studies indicate that 24-nt SRCs may play
roles in regulating heterosis-related changes. However, the
functions of 24-nt SRCs in other physiological processes
remain to be investigated.

Conclusion and perspectives

The application of high-throughput sequencing technology has
greatly facilitated sRNA studies, and signiﬁcant progresses have
been achieved during the past few years. Yet few studies on plant
sRNAs have been focused on SRCs. Substantial challenges
related to SRC identiﬁcation and functional studies in plants
still remain. For example, as many siRNAs within SRCs have
multiple loci on the genome, how to discriminate the siRNA
expressed loci from others is a big problem. Are siRNAs within
a SRC equally important in terms of functions, or there are dom-
inant ones? A large number of SRCs have also been identiﬁed
from tRNAs and rRNAs recently, whether they are functional
or only degradation products remain to be addressed as well.
Nevertheless, the extensive presence of SRCs in plant genomes
is a good indication for their functional importance; the remain-
ing mysteries will be uncovered sooner or later.
