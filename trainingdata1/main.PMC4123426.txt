Abstract The functions of the liver and the pancreas differ; however, chronic inﬂammation in both
organs is associated with ﬁbrosis. Evidence suggests that ﬁbrosis in both organs is partially regu-
lated by organ-speciﬁc stellate cells. We explore the proteome of human hepatic stellate cells
(hHSC) and human pancreatic stellate cells (hPaSC) using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quanti-
tative proteomics to investigate pathophysiologic mechanisms. Proteins were isolated from whole
cell lysates of immortalized hHSC and hPaSC. These proteins were tryptically digested, labeled with
tandem mass tags (TMT), fractionated by OFFGEL, and subjected to MS. Proteins signiﬁcantly
different in abundance (P < 0.05) were classiﬁed via gene ontology (GO) analysis. We identiﬁed
1223 proteins and among them, 1222 proteins were quantiﬁable. Statistical analysis determined that
177 proteins were of higher abundance in hHSC, while 157 were of higher abundance in hPaSC. GO
classiﬁcation revealed that proteins of relatively higher abundance in hHSC were associated with
protein production, while those of relatively higher abundance in hPaSC were involved in cell

Introduction

Myoﬁbroblast-like stellate cells are found in both the liver and
the pancreas and are implicated in major diseases of both or-
gans [1]. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are found in the space
of Disse, between Kupffer cells and hepatocytes [2]. Analo-
gously, pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs) are located in the per-
iacinar space of the exocrine pancreas, intercalating duct and
acinar cells [3]. Stellate cells represent 5–8% of the total num-
ber of liver cells [4] and 4% of pancreas cells [5,6]. Despite the
low abundance of these cells in both organs, the various inter-
actions of stellate cells with their microenvironments implicate
these cells as key components of pathologic ﬁbrosis and ﬁbro-
tic diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis [7].
While numerous cellular characteristics of HSC have been
studied, to date, analogous studies of similar depth and scale
of human PaSC (hPaSC) have been limited. For instance, in
mid-2012, a PubMed search of ‘‘hepatic stellate cells’’ located
3374 articles, while a search of ‘‘pancreatic stellate cells’’ re-
sulted in only 409 articles. Nevertheless, the nearly ten-fold
greater number of publications for HSC is an underestimation
as abstracts with alternate names for HSC – such as, Ito cells,
lipocytes, pericytes, peri- and parasinusoidal cells – were not
included in this estimation [8]. As such, PaSCs (often also
abbreviated as PSC) are currently an underexplored resource
to developing a better understanding of diseases of the exo-
crine pancreas. Given the similar mechanisms regulating
HSC and PaSC, applying techniques that have been successful
in liver research may elucidate the pathogenesis and patho-
physiology of PaSC mediated-ﬁbrosis, which is associated with
chronic pancreatitis. A thorough understanding of the molec-
ular mechanisms governing HSC function in regeneration, and
potential analogous processes in PaSC, could revolutionize the
treatment of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.

HSC and PaSC share similar morphological and functional
features, despite originating from different organs. Both cell
types exist in a quiescent state, which upon exposure to exog-
enous signals, e.g., cytokines and growth factors, transdifferen-
tiate into an activated state [7]. Following activation, the
stellate cells also produce smooth muscle actin and secrete
extracellular matrix (ECM) components, pro-ﬁbrotic cyto-
kines, and pro-mitotic cytokines [1]. As such, studies have
implicated HSC and PaSC as integral to the development of
ﬁbrosis [9–14], which is central to the pathogenesis and pro-
gression of liver cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic
cancer.

Extensive proteomic analyses of HSC have been performed
[15–20]. However, few large-scale proteomic studies focusing
on PaSC have been published [21–23]. Furthermore, transcrip-
tomic analysis of HSC and PaSC has demonstrated 99% se-
quence
identity [3,24], but no analogous quantitative
proteomic comparison has been published is available in the
literature. While HSC and PaSC share similar structural and
functional characteristics, differences are expected as each cell
type resides in its unique microenvironment in organs with
vastly different functions. In this study, we aim to compare

the proteomes of a human HSC (hHSC) cell line, LX-2, and
a human PaSC (hPaSC) cell line, RLT-PSC, using state-of-
the-art MS-based quantitative (tandem mass tag isobaric label-
ing) proteomics. Similar to a previously published transcrip-
tomic analysis
comparing hHSC and hPaSC [25], we
identiﬁed the majority of proteins as common between the cell
types, but pronounced differences in certain protein classes
were also identiﬁed.

Results

MS analysis revealed differences in the abundance of hundreds of
proteins between hHSC and hPaSC

We used MS-based quantitative proteomic strategy to com-
pare the proteomes of hHSC and hPaSC (as outlined in
Figure 1). Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling upstream of mass
spectrometric analysis allows for multiplexed relative quantiﬁ-
cation of proteins in multiple samples [26]. In total, we identi-
ﬁed 1223 proteins with a TMT labeling efﬁciency of greater
than 99%, i.e., over 99% of the proteins identiﬁed were quan-
tiﬁed. Only a single protein, branched-chain-amino-acid ami-
notransferase, was identiﬁed exclusively in hHSC (Figure 2),
being present in all three hHSC replicates with 2 unique pep-
tides, but not in any hPaSC samples. Branched chain amino-
transferase functions as a catalyst
the
branched chain amino acids isoleucine, leucine, and valine
[27]. Although the possible reasons for the identiﬁcation of this
protein in hHSC and not hPaSC are yet to be determined,
branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase has been studied
previously in relation to liver development [28]. As such,

Venn diagram shows that only a single protein was exclusively

identiﬁed in both cell types. Of the 1222 quantiﬁed proteins, our
statistical analysis showed 888 proteins as not signiﬁcantly
different in abundance between the two cell types, 177 with
signiﬁcantly higher abundance in the hHSC sample and 157 with
signiﬁcantly higher abundance in the hPaSC sample.

branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase may merit fur-
ther investigation.

t-tests were performed on the remaining 1222 proteins to
determine signiﬁcant differences in abundance between the
two cell types (P < 0.05). The initial analysis identiﬁed 642
proteins present in signiﬁcantly different quantities. To correct
for multiple testing, we applied the Benjamini–Hochberg
method [29], which reduced the number of differentially abun-
dant proteins to 534. Of these, we identiﬁed 334 differentially
abundant proteins with a ±1.5-fold change in either cell type
compared to the other. In total, 177 proteins were enriched in
hHSC, 157 were enriched in hPaSC, while the abundance of
the remaining 888 proteins, which account for nearly 73% of
the total proteins identiﬁed in both cell types, were not signif-
icantly different between these cell types (Figure 2).

To graphically represent these t-test data, volcano plot –
log10(P value) vs. log2(fold change of hHSC/hPaSC) – was
constructed to graphically display the quantitative data (Fig-
ure 3A). Points above the non-axial horizontal line represent
proteins with signiﬁcantly different abundances (P < 0.05).
Points to the left of the left-most non-axial vertical line denote
protein fold changes of hHSC/hPaSC less than  1.5, while
points to the right of the right-most non-axial vertical line de-
note protein fold changes of hHSC/hPaSC greater than 1.5.
The number of
these differentially abundant proteins
(P < 0.05 and fold change >|1.5|) was binned according to
the speciﬁc fold-change of abundance between hHSC and
hPaSC (Figure 3B). The hHSC/hPaSC ratio allowed direct
comparison of protein abundance in hPaSC to that in hHSC.
We note that highest numbers of proteins with signiﬁcant dif-
ferences showed 1.5–2-fold change in abundance, while the 2–
3-fold bin contained the second highest number of proteins.
Only 46 proteins demonstrated a 3 or greater fold change in
either of the two cell types.

GO analysis revealed differences in the classiﬁcation of proteins
enriched in hHSC and hPaSC

Differentially abundant proteins were subjected to GO classiﬁ-
cation via the Panther Classiﬁcation System database [30] to
investigate biological processes, molecular function and cellular
compartment (Figure 4). To limit the number of classiﬁcations,
the analysis returned only those classiﬁcations with at least 5
proteins and a difference of at least 1% between the cell types.
Proteins signiﬁcantly enriched in hHSC were primarily re-
lated to protein production and regulation. For example, bio-
logical process classiﬁcation revealed that proteins involved in
nucleic acid metabolism, protein metabolism, and translation
were more abundant in hHSC than in hPaSC (Figure 4A).
In agreement,
functions of
hHSC-enriched proteins included mRNA binding, nucleic acid
binding, and RNA splicing factors (Figure 4B). Moreover, in
terms of cellular compartment, the hHSC-enriched proteins
were comprised of a substantially higher percentage of ribonu-
cleoprotein (RNP) complexes than hPaSC-enriched proteins
(Figure 4C). The speciﬁc proteins enriched in the hHSC sam-
ples include a large number of ribosomal subunits, eukaryotic
initiation and translation factors, and histones (Table S1), all

Figure 4 GO analysis illustrates classes of proteins differing between cell types
Proteins with signiﬁcant differences between the two cell types were subjected to GO classiﬁcation in terms of biological process (A),
molecular function (B) and cellular compartment (C). We set a threshold of 5 proteins per classiﬁcation and a difference of at least 1%
between the two cell types examined.

of which are linked to cellular transcription and translation
processes.

The majority of the proteins that were signiﬁcantly enriched
in hPaSC were related to cellular structure. In terms of biolog-
ical processes, these proteins were classiﬁed mainly in anatom-
ical morphology, cell communication, cellular morphogenesis,
cellular organization, and developmental processes
(Fig-
ure 4A). As expected, the biological processes correlated well
with their molecular function classiﬁcation (Figure 4B): cyto-
skeletal protein binding, cytoskeletal structure, protein binding
and structural molecules. These molecular functions indicate a
direct involvement in cell structure. Moreover, the cellular
compartment classiﬁcation of these proteins revealed that the
most populous categories were actin cytoskeleton, cytoskele-
ton and intracellular, consistent with the aforementioned bio-
logical processes and molecular functions (Figure 4C). The
speciﬁc proteins enriched in the hPaSC samples include annex-
ins, actinins, actin-related proteins, ﬁlamins, myosins and trop-
omyosins (Table S2), all of which are actin binding proteins
involved in cytoskeletal structure and function.

Comparison of proteomic data with previously published
transcriptomic data

Using a 23,000 feature oligonucleotide microarray, a previous
transcriptomic analysis discovered 29 genes of signiﬁcant dif-
ferential expression (fold difference > 2), between hHSC and
hPaSC [16]. Although it is difﬁcult to directly compare our dif-
ferential proteomic analysis to the aforementioned transcrip-
tomic analysis [25], due to confounders related to cell lines,
sample preparation techniques, and statistical methods used,
these studies revealed similar observations. In general, both
analyses indicated that the majority of the identiﬁed pro-
teins/transcripts were present in both cell types and did not
demonstrate signiﬁcant differences in abundance (P > 0.05).
While only 29 transcripts (9 in hHSC and 20 in hPaSC,
approximately 0.1% of the dataset) were determined to be en-
riched in the transcriptomic analysis [31], we identiﬁed a total
of 334 proteins (177 in hHSC and 157 in hPaSC, approxi-
mately 5% of our dataset) that were enriched in either sample.
Our protein counts, however, were determined using a 1.5-fold

difference threshold. Using a 2-fold threshold, as was done in
[25], the number of enriched proteins we identiﬁed would be re-
duced to 64 in hHSC and 76 in hPaSC (Figure 3B). Some of
the differences between the transcriptomics and proteomics
data may be attributed to regulation at the level of protein
translation [32].

Interestingly, for 5 of the 29 genes determined to be differen-
tially expressed in the transcriptomic analysis, their correspond-
ing encoded proteins were also identiﬁed as differentially
expressed in our proteomics analysis. These proteins included
actin, gamma-enteric smooth muscle (ACTG2), destrin, four
and a half LIM domains protein 1 (FHL1), L-lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase iso-
zyme L1 (UCH-L1) (Table 1). Except LDH, the remaining 4
proteins were all lower in abundance in hHSC compared to
hPaSC, and as such may be the ﬁrst proteins upon which to fol-
low-up. Proteins corresponding to the remaining 24 genes were
not identiﬁed in our proteomic analysis, and may be below the
detection limit of our analytical strategy.

Discussion

We have shown that the proteomes of hHSC and hPaSC are
similar at our depth of analysis. Using whole cell lysates, OFF-
GEL fractionation, and TMT MS-based quantitative proteo-
mics we quantiﬁed over 1200 proteins. Of these proteins, we
determined several hundred to be signiﬁcantly enriched in
one of the two cell types, although over 70% of the proteins
did not differ signiﬁcantly between the two cell types. GO clas-
siﬁcation revealed that the majority of proteins of higher abun-
dance in hHSC are related to protein production. Such a result
may imply that cellular proliferation is at a higher rate in
hHSC than hPaSC. Conversely the majority of proteins of
higher abundance in hPaSC play a role in cellular structure,
which may indicate that a different set of proteins are used
in hPaSC to maintain or regulate changes in cellular morphol-
ogy. The mechanisms underlying such distinct differences are
unclear, and further studies are necessary to determine its
causes and implications.

A comparison of previously published transcriptomic data
with our proteomic data yielded similar general trends. The
majority of the proteins were of comparable abundance in
each cell type, and all but one protein was identiﬁed in both
cell types. However, the transcriptomic data showed no differ-
ences in over 99% of the genes investigated, whereas over 70%
of the total proteins in our proteomic data did not demonstrate
signiﬁcant differences. Discordance between mRNA and
protein analyses is common. Studies have shown similar low

correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data, par-
ticularly when the depth of proteomic data is
limited
[25,33,34]. Although central dogma of molecular biology illus-
trates the ﬂow of information from mRNA to proteins, other
factors – for example, translational efﬁciency, alternative splic-
ing, complex formation and degradation rates and localization
– can affect the level of proteins independent of the transcript.
This may have been the case with L-lactate dehydrogenase,
whose transcript was half as abundant in hHSC compared to
hPaSC, but at the protein level was 2.5 times as abundant in
the hHSC compared to hPaSC. Limited by the data collected,
we cannot determine the true source of this disparity. Greater
proteome coverage could provide further evidence supporting
the similarities identiﬁed in our proteomics study between
hHSC and hPaSC, and may uncover additional proteins which
are signiﬁcantly different in the two cell types, for example
those discovered by transcriptomic analysis.

The ﬁve proteins listed in Table 1 may serve as promising
candidates for follow-up experiments, as many have been pre-
viously associated with hepatic and/or pancreatic disease.
Smooth muscle actin has been implicated in ﬁbrosis in both he-
patic [35–37] and pancreatic [38] disease, as this protein is a
marker of activation of stellate cells from quiescence [39,40].
Likewise, the actin binding protein destrin is associated with
perineural invasion of pancreatic cancer [41], and has been
associated with effects on hepatic tumor cells in the presence
of an anti-tumor drug [42]. Four and a half LIM domains pro-
tein 1 is a low abundant protein in the liver and pancreas and is
commonly linked to myopathies [43], but its role in pathophys-
iological aspects of hepatic and pancreatic disease is currently
unknown. L-lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is involved in
tissue breakdown and turnover, which has been shown to be
elevated in cancer cells, including those of pancreatic cancer
[44]. In addition, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 is
a deubiquitinating enzyme highly speciﬁc to neurons [45] and
has a role in tumor development [46], however, its role in pan-
creatic and hepatic disease remains undetermined. These pro-
teins may be investigated further to study their involvement
in the pathophysiology of pancreatic and/or hepatic disease.

Although immortalized cell lines are accepted for initial
investigation, particularly for the ease of propagation and
homogeneity, freshly isolated cells from their in vivo environ-
ment may better reﬂect the true cellular characteristics. In fact,
disparities with the transcriptomics dataset [31] and our pro-
teomics data may also be a result of our proteomics data being
based on immortalized cell lines, while the transcriptomics
data were from freshly isolated cells. As such, while the work
herein focuses on immortalized hHSC and hPaSC cell lines,
performing these experiments with freshly isolated cells would

110

Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 105–113

avoid potential confounding by artifacts introduced by the
immortalization process and thus reveal more similarities with
the previously collected transcriptomics data. Such studies
would be valuable as these freshly isolated cells are genotypi-
cally unaltered from their in vivo states and are a more accurate
representation of in vivo stellate cells.

The differences identiﬁed between the two cell types may be
partially attributed to the organ of origin for these cells, as well
as the evolutionary divergence of these two cell types. Questions
surround the potential of a common origin of HSC and PaSC,
evidence suggests that PaSC and HSC have common precursor
cells in the neural crest [4]. These precursor cells give rise to
astrocytes, smooth muscle cells and neurons. In intermediate
stages, the precursor cells express nestin, glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) and smooth muscle actin, all of which are pro-
tein markers of stellate cells [47]. However, other data have
shown that pluripotent stem cells from the adult pancreas can
differentiate into cell types characteristic of pancreatic endo-
crine, exocrine and stellate cells [48], and HSC may be differen-
tiated from bone marrow [49], which would indicate that the
microenvironment of the cells, rather than a common precursor,
may be responsible for the phenotypic commonalities between
the two cell types. Further research exploring the origin of
HSC and PaSC would provide important data about hepatic
and pancreatic development, ﬁbrosis and carcinogenesis.

In summary, PaSC hold great promise in the study of chronic
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. These cells represent a valu-
able resource in improving our understanding of pancreatic dis-
ease pathogenesis, pathophysiology and therapy. Tapping into
the decades of prior HSC studies may rapidly expedite PaSC re-
search. We have used quantitative MS to identify nearly 900
proteins that are of similar abundance in hHSC and hPaSC, in
addition to over 300 which were enriched in one of the cell lines.
Similarities were expected as both cells share structural charac-
teristics, transdifferentiate into ECM-secreting activated cells
upon exogenous insult and play key roles in ﬁbrosis of their
respective organs. Transcriptomic studies have also provided
evidence of transcript similarity at the mRNA level [25]. How-
ever, fundamental differences remain as these cells are part of
larger organs with dissimilar functions and are situated in very
different microenvironments. Without further evidence, it is
premature to correlate these proteomic differences between liver
and pancreas with the regenerative capacity of the liver and the
absence of such in the pancreas. However, application and
methodological enhancements of the quantitative proteomics
techniques described herein may facilitate future studies of pan-
creatic regenerative potential via in-depth characterization of
hHSC and hPaSC proteomes. Further research is necessary to
fully characterize the differences and similarities between hHSC
and hPaSC proteomes and to elucidate further the roles of the
differentially-expressed proteins in healthy and diseased livers
and pancreata.

Materials and methods

Materials

Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s-F12 medium (DMEM/F12;
11330) was purchased from Gibco (Carlsbad, CA). Fetal bo-
vine serum (FBS; F0392) was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO). CellStripper (25-056-CL) was purchased from

Mediatech (Manassas, VA). TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tag-
ging Kit was purchased from Thermo Scientiﬁc (Rockford,
IL). Sequencing-grade modiﬁed trypsin (V5111) was obtained
from Promega (Madison, WI). SeeBluePlus2 Pre-Stained stan-
dard (LC5925), lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer
(NP0008), NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels
(NP0335), SimplyBlueCoomassie stain (LC0665) and 2-(N-
morpholino)
sulfate

gen (Carlsbad, CA). Other reagents and solvents were from
Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Burdick & Jackson (Mor-
ristown, NJ), respectively.

ethanesulfonic acid-sodium dodecyl

Cell lines and maintenance

The hHSC cell line LX-2 [50] was a kind gift from Dr. Scott
Friedman (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and the hPaSC
cell line RLT-PSC [51] was a gift from Dr. Ralf Jesnowski
(German Cancer Research Center). Cell growth and propaga-
tion was carried out as previously described [21,22].

Cell lysis and protein extraction

One milliliter of TBSp (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4
supplemented with 1· Roche Complete protease inhibitors)
containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% SDS was added to each
cell pellet. Cells were homogenized by 12 passes through a 27
gauge (1.25 inches long) needle and incubated on ice with gen-
tle agitation for 1 h. The homogenate was then sedimented by
ultracentrifugation at 100,000 · g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the
supernatant was
collected. Protein concentrations were
determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (23225,
ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc).

Tryptic digestion and TMT labeling

Each cell lysate was diluted to a concentration of 150 lg of to-
tal protein per 100 ll of 100 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbon-
ate (TEAB) buffer. Protein digests were performed as speciﬁed
in the manufacturer’s instructions for the Thermo Scientiﬁc’s
TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit (catalog #90064B).
Similarly, TMT labeling was performed according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Each biological replicate was labeled
with a unique tag. hHSC samples received tags 126, 128, and
130, while hPaSC samples received tags 127, 129, and 131
(as illustrated in Figure 1). Prior to fractionation, samples were
desalted using OASIS HLB reversed-phase cartridges (Waters,
186000383) as outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions. The
methanol-eluted peptides were vacuum centrifuged to dryness.

OFFGEL peptide fractionation

Peptides were reconstituted in a 0.2% ampholyte solution in
water (GE Healthcare, 17-6000-87). Peptides were separated
on a 24-cm IEF strip (GE Healthcare 17-6002-44) using stan-
dard program OG24PE00 on an Agilent OFFGEL 3100 sys-
tem,
collected from OFFGEL wells and deposited in
separate tubes. 150 lL of 0.1% TFA was added to each well
and then incubated for 15 min. This extraction was added to
the tube containing the ﬁrst aspirate. Each sample was desalted
in TopTip SCX columns (Glygen, TT2SSC) using a binding

Paulo JA et al / Proteomics of Pancreatic & Hepatic Stellate Cells

111

solution containing 0.1% formic acid and 20% acetonitrile,
and releasing solution containing 5% ammonium hydroxide
and 30% methanol releasing solution. The eluent was vacuum
centrifuged to dryness.

LC–MS/MS analysis

Peptides were reconstituted in 5% formic acid and 5% aceto-
nitrile in water prior to fractionation by nanoﬂow reversed-
phase ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (nanoLC,
Eksigent) in-line with a linear trap quadrupole mass spectrom-
eter (LTQ, Thermo Scientiﬁc). The reversed-phase liquid chro-
matography columns (15 cm · 100 lm ID) were packed in-
house (Magic C18, 5 lm, 100 A˚ , Michrom BioResources).
Samples were analyzed with a 60-min linear gradient (5–35%
acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid) and data were acquired
in a data-dependent manner, with 6 MS/MS scans for every
full scan spectrum. Precursor ion activation and dissociation
was accomplished via pulsed Q dissociation (PQD) to allow
the observation of low m/z fragments that are usually excluded
from standard collision-induced dissociation (CID). The colli-
sion energy was set at 32, the isolation wavelength at 2 Th, the
activation Q at 0.55 and the acquisition time at 0.4 ms.

Bioinformatics and data analysis

All data generated were searched against the Human UniProt
database (downloaded November 11, 2011) using the Mascot
search engine (v.2.3; Matrix Science, Boston MA). Table S3 in-
cludes a complete list of proteins identiﬁed. One miscleavage per
peptide was allowed and mass tolerances of ±1 Da (monoiso-
topic) for precursors and of ±0.8 Da for fragment ions were
used, as is default for LTQ data analysis. Amino acid modiﬁca-
tions: ﬁxed: carbamidomethyl (Cys); variable: TMT6plex (N-
term) and TMT6plex (K). Mascot search results are combined
using in-house-developed software. In compliance with recom-
mendations [52–54] proposed by the major proteomic journals,
we utilized protein identiﬁcation validation methods that mini-
mize false positives and report only high conﬁdence identiﬁca-
tions. Our false discovery rate (FDR) was 1% at the peptide
level, as determined by searching the same dataset against the
target database and a decoy database; the latter featuring the re-
versed amino acid sequences of all the entries in the Human Uni-
Prot database [55,56]. Median intensities of reporter ions for
each protein were determined normalized across all samples.

Statistical analysis

t-tests, Benjamini–Hochberg corrections [29] and volcano plots
[57] were produced in Excel 2010 (Microsoft; Redmond, WA).
Three biological replicates were performed for each cell type
and proteomic differences were evaluated for statistical signif-
icance (P < 0.05) by student t-tests, and corrected for multiple
testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Means were
calculated for the three biological replicates and fold-changes
were determined by dividing the mean intensity value of the li-
ver samples by that of the pancreas samples for each protein.
The fold change was transformed using the log2 function, so
that the data is centered around zero, while the Benjamini–
Hochberg corrected P value was  log10 transformed for
volcano plot scaling.
