ABSTRACT
Summary: Dose–response information is critical to understanding
drug effects, yet analytical methods for dose–response assays
cannot cope with the dimensionality of large-scale screening data
such as the microarray proﬁling data. To overcome this limitation, we
developed and implemented the Sigmoidal Dose Response Search
(SDRS) algorithm, a grid search-based method designed to handle
large-scale dose–response data. This method not only calculates the
pharmacological parameters for every assay, but also provides built-
in statistic that enables downstream systematic analyses, such as
characterizing dose response at the transcriptome level.

1 INTRODUCTION
Dose–response assays are routinely used in today’s pharmaceutical
development. Mechanistically, compound:target binding occurs at
a single site and follows the law of mass action that is reﬂected
by the sigmoidal dose–response pattern seen in many assays
(Balakrishnan, 1991). In statistics, sigmoidal dose-responses can be
identiﬁed by non-linear regression, a form of regression analysis
where the model function is a non-linear combination of the model
parameters (Seber and Wild, 1989). Non-linear regression methods
such as the well-known Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm involve
successive approximations that aim at minimizing an error function
(Marquardt, 1963). Despite the general applicability of the iterative
non-linear regression methods, there are a couple of limitations
in their application to large-scale dose–response screening data.
First, the iterative methods do not impose a boundary on the model
parameter values, and thus the output model may contain unrealistic
or uninterpretable values such as a negative EC50. Second, these
methods only calculate the parameter values and ﬁtting statistic for
the best model, but do not provide a means that can be integrated in
downstream analyses such as the characterization of transcriptome
response (Ji et al., 2009).

Ji et al.

recently described a grid search-based
algorithm, Sigmoidal Dose Response Search (SDRS), for identifying
transcripts that exhibited sigmoidal dose-response to the treatments
of kinase inhibitors. Since the SDRS algorithm is generic and can
be expanded to identify other dose–response patterns in different
sources of quantitative data, we have implemented the method as
a Perl module with C inline codes (Bio::SDRS). We demonstrated
the general utility of the method using a dataset from high content
screening (HCS).

2 METHOD AND IMPLEMENTATION
Our implementation of the SDRS algorithm includes a typical
sigmoidal dose–response model
for one-site compound:target
interaction,

Y = A+(B−A)/(1+(X/C)D)

where Y is the assay readout value, X is the dose and the four
unknown parameters correspond to minimal response (A), maximal
response (B), EC50 (C) and the Hill slope (D).

In essence,

the SDRS algorithm tests a series of candidate
EC50 values (i.e. search doses) across the experimental dose range.
Therefore, at every search dose it is a three point grid search for
the one-site model. For transcription proﬁling data, every probeset
on the array is treated as an independent assay for the response
of its corresponding transcript and its expression values at the
experimental doses constitute the assay data.

We assume that every assay generates a positive readout. For
every assay, the range for the parameter A is determined based on
the six (default, or per user deﬁned) lowest readout values, and is
set to be the mean value plus or minus two multiples of the standard
deviation (SD). If the lower boundary is less than zero, it is reset to
the minimal of the readouts. The search step for A is one-fourth of
the SD. Similarly, the range for the parameter B is determined using
the six (default, or per user deﬁned) highest values and the step
is also one-fourth of the SD. The parameter D can vary between
−6.3 and 6.3, with a step of 0.3. (In reality, D can vary from −∞
to +∞. However, when the absolute value of D is >6, additional
increments have only marginal impact on the estimates of the other
three parameters.) Placing data-driven limits on parameter values
allows SDRS to exclude unusable parameters such as negative EC50
values.

At every search dose, the SDRS algorithm evaluates all possible
combinations of parameter values and calculates the deviation

of expected values based on the dose–response model from the
observational data. The goodness of ﬁt is measured by an F-statistic:
F= MSR
MSE , where MSR is the mean square of the variance explained
by the model and MSE is the mean square of error (Supplementary
Table S1). Assuming that the residuals are normally distributed,
the F-statistic follows an F-distribution, F(p−1, n−p), where n
is the number of experimental dose points and p is the number of
parameters in the model. For every assay, at every search dose tested,
the (local) maximal F-statistic and the corresponding parameter
values are recorded.

At the end of the grid search, every assay is associated with a series
of F-statistic. An assay is designated as ﬁtted to a dose–response
model if its global maximal F-statistic (i.e. best ﬁt) is larger than
a predeﬁned critical F value, for example, at P <0.05. For each
assay, the parameter values that gave rise to the global maximal
F-statistic deﬁne the optimal model. The 95% conﬁdence interval
for C (i.e. EC50) is deﬁned as from the lowest search dose where
the local maximal F-statistic is larger than the critical value to the
highest search dose that meets the same criteria. Conﬁdence intervals
for other model parameters can be found similarly.

One output of SDRS is qualitatively similar to that of an iterative
algorithm: each assay is associated with a predicted EC50, P-value
and fold-change (i.e. the ratio of B to A). However, SDRS also
generates an F-statistic for every assay at each search dose. This
output, which is unique to the grid search method, allows for a
global characterization and comparison of dose responses (Ji et al.,
2009). For example, the F scores at a search dose can be fed to a
multiple test correction procedure (such as FDR) to calculate the
number of ‘true responses’ at the dose. Repeating this procedure
for every search dose across the dose range can uncover peak(s)
of response. The F score output also allows for pathway impact
mapping and dose–response comparison at the transcriptome level
across the dose range.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Herein, we present the SDRS algorithm, which is implemented as
a Perl module with C inline codes (Bio::SDRS). We applied the
algorithm to a dataset from HCS assays that measured programmed
cell death using caspase 3, caspase 8 and cytochrome C as readouts

in the ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-4. The SDRS outputs
were compared with those generated by XLﬁt, a software that
implements the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (Table 1). XLﬁt
identiﬁed 19 dose responses in these assays. In contrast, SDRS
identiﬁed three dose responses in addition to those identiﬁed by
XLﬁt. The three additional dose responses identiﬁed by SDRS
appear to be real (Supplementary Figure S1). There is a gradual
increase in cytochrome C readouts as the Compound1 concentration
increases. In the case of Compound4, it is likely that the compound
also has a dose response since both the caspase 8 and cytochrome
C assay produced high readouts at the highest dose. When both
response plateaus are present, the parameter values generated by
SDRS are almost identical to those generated by the iterative method
(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). However, when one of the
curve plateaus is not present, i.e. where A or B are not well deﬁned,
the output is dependent on the behavior of the algorithm utilized. For
example, when the high plateau is missing, extreme values for B and
C are generated, with C often larger than the maximal experimental
dose (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). Similarly, when the
low plateau is missing, iterative methods may generate negative
estimates for A and C. Although there is no ‘right’ solution in these
cases, as the data are not sufﬁcient for parameter estimation, SDRS
generates more ‘realistic’ estimates because it imposes constraints
on the parameter values based on assay data and experimental dose
range (Table 1).

Although SDRS was initially developed to handle genomic scale
transcriptional dose–response data, it can be used to analyze all other

types of dose–response data from qPCR and lead evaluation where it
performs as efﬁciently as iterative non-linear regression methods (Ji
et al., 2009, and Rui-Ru Ji). For large datasets, SDRS can be run in
parallel very efﬁciently across a multicore system (Supplementary
Table S2). SDRS is robust to the naturally occurring variability
in large-scale screening data, where the assays are not necessarily
‘optimized’. Importantly, only SDRS provides a full set of F-statistic
across the dose range that can be utilized in downstream system level
analyses and comparisons.
