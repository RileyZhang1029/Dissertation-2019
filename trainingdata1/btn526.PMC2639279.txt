ABSTRACT
Motivation: Cis-acting
frequently
constrained by both sequence content and positioning relative
to a functional site, such as a splice or polyadenylation site.
We describe an approach to regulatory motif analysis based on
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Whereas existing pattern
recognition algorithms commonly focus primarily on sequence
content, our method simultaneously characterizes both positioning
and sequence content of putative motifs.
Results: Tests on artiﬁcially generated sequences show that NMF
can faithfully reproduce both positioning and content of test motifs.
We show how the variation of the residual sum of squares can be
used to give a robust estimate of the number of motifs or patterns
in a sequence set. Our analysis distinguishes multiple motifs with
signiﬁcant overlap in sequence content and/or positioning. Finally, we
demonstrate the use of the NMF approach through characterization
of biologically interesting datasets. Speciﬁcally, an analysis of mRNA
3(cid:2)-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation) sites from a broad
range of higher eukaryotes reveals a conserved core pattern of three
elements.

1 INTRODUCTION
Regulatory sequence identiﬁcation and characterization remains an
important and challenging problem. Many classes of functional
sequences, for instance those involved in processing of precursor
mRNA (pre-mRNA), are constrained both by sequence content
and positioning with respect to a functional site. Standard pattern
recognition tools for sequence analysis typically either ignore
positioning effects altogether, or else force the positioning to ﬁt
a predeﬁned model, such as a Gaussian distribution (Ao et al.,
2004). Recent reviews of computational approaches to pattern
recognition have pointed out that positioning preference remains
an underutilized means of specifying motifs (Li and Tompa, 2006;
Tompa et al., 2005). Speciﬁc positioning of motifs, especially
relative positioning, can be evolutionarily conserved (Vardhanabhuti
et al., 2007). Characterization of positioning dependencies have
most commonly been approached in variants of positional word

counting (PWC) (Fairbrother et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2005; Salisbury
et al., 2006), tracking both occurrence and relative position of all
of the sequence words of a given size k (k-mers). PWC results in
a two-dimensional matrix (V), in which rows are indexed by k-mer
and columns are indexed by position relative to a functional site. The
rows of such a matrix can be interpreted as unnormalized conditional
probability distributions, reﬂecting the probability of observing the
speciﬁc k-mer at a given position relative to the functional site (and
conditional on its presence).

Previous analysis based on PWC relied on standard clustering
approaches, such as hierarchical or k-means, identifying groups of
k-mers with similar positioning probabilities near functional sites
(Hu et al., 2005; Loke et al., 2005). Several approaches have been
developed to merge the clusters of related k-mers into a single
representative positional weight matrix (PWM) (Hu et al., 2005;
Loke et al., 2005). These approaches produce reasonable results
in the instance of independent, non-overlapping motifs, however,
functional motifs often overlap signiﬁcantly in positioning and/or
sequence content. A particularly relevant case can be found in
the UG- and U-rich elements that occur downstream of vertebrate
(cid:2)
3
-processing sites. These elements are quite degenerate in sequence
content (Hu et al., 2005; Salisbury et al., 2006; Zhao et al.,
1999), and have overlapping but distinct positioning distributions
(Salisbury et al., 2006), conditions that result in a number of U-rich
k-mers with multi-modal positioning distributions, reﬂecting the
likelihood that the k-mer can appear as a part of either the U- or
UG-rich motif (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 1).

This deﬁnes the challenge to be addressed: given the set
of positioning distributions for all k-mers (as deﬁned in the
PWC matrix), derive the underlying motifs that are most likely
to have generated it. To solve this problem, we adapted the
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, a dimension
reduction technique ﬁrst developed for image processing (Lee and
Seung, 1999) that has subsequently gained popularity in processing
high-dimensional biological data, such as microarrays (Carmona-
Saez et al., 2006; Kim and Tidor, 2003; Pascual-Montano et al.,
2006b). NMF, similar to principal components analysis, generates
Òbasis vectorsÓ (referred to here as ‘elements’) to reduce the
dimensionality of large datasets. The original authors found that the
non-negativity constraint resulted in elements that reﬂected distinct
components of the underlying data, for instance eyes or a nose
in facial images. In our analysis, this is analogous to elements
representing speciﬁc sequence patterns or putative regulatory motifs.

We ﬁrst deﬁne terminology: in the abstract analysis of NMF, we
refer to a set of features that are measured in samples. In tangible
examples, we have pixels measured in images, gene probesets
measured in microarray experiments, or sequence words (k-mers)
counted in positions or windows. The successful application of
NMF relies on the validity of the following assumptions: (1) the
measurement of feature i in sample j can be approximated as a linear
superposition of r patterns [equation (1)]; (2) the m-th term in the
sum is the product of two probabilities: the probability of observing
feature i in pattern m and the probability of observing pattern m in
sample j and (3) the relative probabilities of observing each feature
in the m-th pattern are constant across all samples.

In this article, we investigate the parameters of the NMF
method, speciﬁcally investigating the robustness of the solutions
with variation in the analysis parameters. We demonstrate the use
of the NMF algorithm for the detection and characterization of
sequence motifs that include constrained positioning, producing
models of both sequence content and positioning. We show how
variation in the residual sum of squares (RSS) of the approximated
data matrix provides a robust estimate of the appropriate number of
elements, while simultaneously revealing whether or not an NMF
analysis is appropriate for the dataset. Analysis of synthetic datasets
demonstrates that NMF can accurately describe both positioning and
sequence characteristics of implanted patterns, and that NMF ﬁnds
patterns that are missed by other approaches to pattern recognition.
Finally, we apply the NMF approach to two interesting biological
datasets: 3
-processing sites from a phylogenetically broad sampling
of eukaryotic organisms and transcription start sites from the fruit ﬂy,
Drosophila melanogaster (available in Supplementary Materials).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Synthetic test matrices and sequences
To test the theoretical basis for the use of the RSS to establish the number
of elements r, we generated two artiﬁcial matrices. The ﬁrst matrix was
generated from pseudo-random draws from a Gaussian distribution. The
second matrix was generated to precisely match the conditions that NMF
models. Starting with a random background, patterns to be added were
generated by pseudo-random draws that assigned (1) the probability of each
feature occurring in each pattern (corresponding to the W matrix, deﬁned
below), and (2) the probability of each pattern occurring in each measurement
(the H matrix deﬁned below).

To test the complete motif characterization procedure, we generated
randomized sequences (based on ﬁxed known dinucleotide frequencies)
seeded with known motifs (Table 1). In most tests, motifs were inserted
into 95% of the test sequences, however, we also explicitly also generated
sets of size T = 300 in which all motifs were put into 50% and 25% of
the sequences, respectively. In order to better mimic true conditions, we
used sequences with length 400 nt, deﬁning the center point as position
0, and used distinct dinucleotide frequencies for the negative and positive
portions of the sequences. To test the performance with changes in number
of sequences, we generated independent training sets with sizes T = 30,
100, 300, 1000, 3000 and 10 000, respectively. Motifs were placed within
these sequences according to independent pseudo-random draws from a
positioning distribution and a sequence content PWM. All sequence ﬁles
used in this analysis are available at http://harlequin.jax.org/nmf/.

2.2 Biological training sequences
We obtained putative 3
-processing sites from our database PACdb, which
uses EST-to-genome alignments to assign probable sites as described
previously (Brockman et al., 2005). Putative transcription start sites
and surrounding sequences for D.melanogaster were obtained from the
Supplementary Material from Gershenzon et al. (2006).

2.3 NMF decomposition
Starting with a set of training sequences all containing, and aligned on, a
common functional site, we generate the PWC matrix V, a two-dimensional
matrix of counts that is indexed by k-mer and relative position, respectively.
In practice, k-mers are counted in contiguous windows of size w, where each
k-mer is assigned to the window in which it begins. As such, k-mers can span
the boundary between adjacent windows, but will only be assigned to one. In
the case of small datasets (less than a few hundred training sequences), we
ﬁnd it advantageous to smooth each row of V independently, maintaining the
total counts across the entire row (for real or artiﬁcial data). Pseudocounts
are also an available option to compensate for small datasets, however they
have not explicitly been investigated in this study. Using the same update
and objective function as the original NMF publication (Lee and Seung,
1999), we decompose the PWC matrix V according to Equation (2), where
Vij = count of the i-th sequence word in the j-th position window, Wim = the
weight of the i-th k-mer in the m-th element, Hmj = activity of the m-th
element in the j-th position window, M is the number of k-mers considered,
N is the number of positioning windows, and r is the number of elements
created.

= W[Mxr] x H[rxN]

V[MxN]

We interpret the r basis vectors as representing distinct patterns of sequence
content and positioning (Graber et al., 2007),
including both speciﬁc
sequence elements representing functional components, along with speciﬁc
changes in sequence composition such as found at the junction between UTR
and intergenic sequence. In practice, we typically view the positioning data
(H) in its raw form and also in a normalized form, in which each column of
H is scaled to a common area under its curve. The raw data view enables
comparison of the relative activity between elements, whereas the normalized
view emphasizes the speciﬁcity of positioning for each element. All plots in
this article are normalized.

A critical issue in any dimensional reduction analysis is the selection
of the reduced number of dimensions (r). Previous attempts to optimize
selection of r in NMF analysis have focused primarily on the cophenetic
correlation coefﬁcient (CCC) (Brunet et al., 2004; Pascual-Montano et al.,
2006a). We ﬁnd that variation in the RSS between the data matrix (V) and
the NMF-estimated matrix (WH) provides a natural means for estimation of
r, in as much as this plot shows an inﬂection when r matches the proper
number of dimensions. In practice, while an optimal NMF solution requires
several hundred random restarts, the determination of r can be made with

a signiﬁcantly smaller number of solutions, typically 20–30 for tested each
value of r (data not shown).

We ﬁrst investigated variation of RSS with variation of r in two artiﬁcial
datasets, with and without patterns inserted. The RSS of the purely random
matrix shows a roughly linear decrease with increased number of elements
(Fig. 1a), whereas the matrix with inserted patterns shows a clear inﬂection
point where r equals the number of patterns. Our interpretation of this result
is that while r is less than the number of patterns, there is excess variance
in the data that cannot be adequately approximated by the NMF matrix. In
contrast, as r equals and surpasses the true number of patterns, the additional
reduction of the RSS is minor, since the variation captured by the additional
elements is likely only random noise.

Further conﬁrmation of this phenomenon was obtained through NMF
analysis of three sequence sets, artiﬁcial sequences with and without inserted
patterns and 8500 sequences with length 400 nt centered on putative human
(cid:2)
3
-processing sites (Salisbury et al., 2006). PWC matrices were generated
from each sequence set, then subsequently analyzed via NMF, largely
reproducing the results of the artiﬁcial matrices (Fig. 1b). The ﬁrst set, with
no patterns inserted, shows a roughly constant and linear decrease in RSS
with increasing r. In contrast, the set with known motifs inserted shows an
inﬂection point at approximately the number of inserted patterns. Finally, the
analysis of putative 3
-processing sites also displays a disjoint pattern, with
an inﬂection point at approximately r = 9. For all analysis in this article, we
use the optimal value of r determined in this manner.

(cid:2)

The complete NMF analysis requires the selection of a number of free
parameters. Of particular note are the selection of window size (w) and
k-mers size (k). Larger windows give increased statistical robustness afforded
by aggregation but at the cost of less speciﬁc positioning. Longer words
enable better characterization of long patterns, but at the cost of increased
execution time as well as an increased number of sequences needed for
training. In the ideal case of a large number of training sequences, k would
be at least as long as the smallest expected motif, and w= 1, counting each
position individually. However, datasets are ﬁnite and can number only
a few tens to hundreds. Previous studies have provided estimates of the
minimum number of sequences required for reasonable estimation of k-mer
probabilities (Fairbrother et al., 2002). In practice, we typically select w and
k jointly such that the product wT is at least ﬁve times greater than 4k, the
number of k-mers under consideration.

2.4 Converting NMF word lists (W.j) to motifs
As we reported previously (Graber et al., 2007), we assume that the weighted
list of k-mers for each element can be interpreted as the expected distribution
of k-mer counts for each element. The optimal motif is inferred as the
motif with the maximum multinomial probability of observing the expected
distribution. The speciﬁcs of the probability calculation were described
previously (Graber et al., 2007). Brieﬂy, the probability of observing any

2686

speciﬁc k-mer within a motif is the sum of the probabilities of observing
the motif at all positions within the motif,
including those that span
the boundaries between the motif and the background. This summation
speciﬁcally enables characterization of motifs of nearly arbitrary size
regardless of the choice of k. To optimize the search of potential motifs,
we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach (Gelman et al.,
1995). The length of the motif is ﬁrst sampled from a user-speciﬁed range
and then nucleotide probabilities at each position are ﬁlled randomly. The
multinomial distribution for the initial motif is scored against the expected
distribution, and then the following procedure is used to update the motif.
A speciﬁc k-mer (wi) is sampled according to the distribution returned by
the NMF analysis. Then a position j within the current motif is sampled
according to the match of the k-mer within the motif. Finally, the motif
is either made more or less similar to the k-mer at motif positions j to
j+k−1, depending upon whether or not wi is over- or underrepresented
in the current model compared with the expected distribution. Following
a standard MCMC approach, updated motifs are automatically accepted if
the multinomial probability increases, and randomly accepted according to
a Boltzmann distribution if the multinomial probability decreases (Gelman
et al., 1995). This process iterates until no improvement is observed for a
user-speciﬁed number of iterations.

In the current implementation of the NMF pattern ﬁnder, we have
made no attempt to optimize performance. A full analysis, including PWC
creation, NMF decomposition and motif construction typically lasts tens
to hundreds of minutes, depending on values of T, k, w and r. Preliminary
tests incorporating the web-based bioNMF resource (Mejia-Roa et al., 2008)
showed signiﬁcant time savings, while also conﬁrming the analysis results.

2.5 Comparison with other pattern-ﬁnding approaches
NMF pattern identiﬁcation was compared with several other approaches,
including the Gibbs Sampler (Lawrence et al., 1993), the Improbizer (Ao
et al., 2004), YMF (Sinha and Tompa, 2003), Weeder (Pavesi et al., 2004)
and oligo-analysis tools (van Helden, 2003). As with previous studies of
pattern identiﬁcation tools (Li and Tompa, 2006; Tompa et al., 2005), an
artiﬁcial dataset (T = 300) was used as the basis for comparison, speciﬁcally
to remove uncertainty of the exact patterns present in the test sequence set.
The Gibbs sampler and the Improbizer were set to ﬁnd six nucleic acid motifs,
searching on single strand only. The Gibbs sampler was allowed to vary motif
size between 5 nt and 8 nt. The Improbizer automatically determines optimal
motif size. Background frequency estimates (required for YMF, Weeder and
oligo-analysis) were generated through analysis of the randomized sequences
with no motifs inserted. Hexamers were counted for YMF and oligo-analysis,
and the ‘SMALL’ setting was used in Weeder. All other settings were left as
defaults.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Characterizing the method and exploring

parameters with artiﬁcial sequence sets

(cid:2)

We previously used the NMF method to characterize sequences
involved in controlling 3
-processing and trans-splicing in the
nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (Graber et al., 2007). As
described in that work, the complete NMF method is dependent
upon several free parameters, including but not limited to, the size
of the k-mers in the initial count (k), the position window size (w),
the number of elements (r) and the number of training sequences
available (T).

To investigate the effects of these parameters and speciﬁcally to
test the robustness of the results with variation in the parameters, we
generated an artiﬁcial dataset in which motifs with deﬁned sequence
content and positioning were inserted into sequences generated from
a deﬁned dinucleotide background. Six different motifs were created

with varying levels of speciﬁcity in both positioning and sequence
(Table 1). To reduce computational complexity, we varied only one
parameter at a time, while holding all others ﬁxed. Figure 2 shows
an example analysis, comparing the actual and NMF-derived motifs
for the T = 300 test set.

3.1.1 Variation in training set size (T) The number of training
sequences (T) is of critical importance, since it is often out of the
researcher’s control, yet explicitly determines the statistical power to
discern subtle signals. Training sets were generated of varying sizes
(T = 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000 and 10 000) and NMF analysis was
performed with parameters ﬁxed at w = 3, k = 4 (tetramers) and r = 8.
Note that while six motifs were inserted, the best results are obtained
with r = 8. As noted previously (Graber et al., 2007), the NMF
analysis identiﬁes both speciﬁc motifs and changes in background
composition along the length of the sequences. The additional two
elements in the NMF decomposition compensate for the change in
background at the center point of the test sequences.

The use of an artiﬁcial dataset allows explicit comparison of
NMF-derived patterns with the motif models. The rows of the
W matrix, which represent the frequency of occurrence for each
k-mer in each motif, were compared with an exact count of
the tetramers that were inserted as part of each motif (including
those that span the motif-background boundary) using a Pearson’s
correlation. The best match of each NMF motif to an inserted
motif is reported in Table 2(Panel A). Similarly, the columns of
the H matrix were compared with the exact distribution of starting
positions for each motif by Pearson’s correlation, with the best
match reported in Table 2(Panel B). The NMF approach successfully
identiﬁes the positioning for all motifs in the sets with T ≥ 300
(r ≥ 0.80), with nearly perfect reproduction for T ≥ 3000 (r ≥ 0.88).

Table entries list the best-match Pearson’s correlations between (Panel A) the exact
k-mer counts generated by insertion of the patterns and rows of the NMF W matrix;
and (Panel B) the positioning distribution used for pattern insertion and columns of the
H matrix.

Even in the smallest datasets, the worst match (motif 4, r = 0.31)
is still statistically signiﬁcant. The sequence content determination
varies in a similar fashion. The strongest motif, with consensus
AATAAA, is unambiguously matched in all datasets (r ≥ 0.9). As
with positioning, the tetramer content of all motifs are well-matched
for all sets with T ≥ 300 (r ≥ 0.62). It is interesting to note that
motif 2, which has identical sequence information content to motif
3, but a less speciﬁc positioning distribution, is less well identiﬁed,
indicating that both the sequence and positioning speciﬁcity can
affect our ability to successfully characterize motifs. Full output
from these analyses are available in Supplementary Figure 2.

3.1.2 Variation in other parameters and conditions As described
in Section 2, the choice of word size (k) and window size (w) are
compromises between conﬂicting needs. Tests on the T =300 dataset
with variations of w and k show that the identiﬁed motifs are robust
with parameter variation. Separate analyses were also performed
on datasets with patterns inserted into either half or a quarter of
the sequences in the training set. Motifs 3–5 (Table 1) were clearly
identiﬁed in both sets, motif 2 was identiﬁed the 50% set, while the
weakest patterns (1 and 6) were poorly matched at best in both sets.
Details of these tests are available in Supplementary Figures 3–5.

3.1.3 Comparison with existing tools To further assess the utility
of the NMF approach, we compared it with a number of popular
pattern recognition tools, focusing on the T =300 test set. The
disparate nature of the results returned from these tools complicates
comparison of the speciﬁc results, therefore we present a summary
(Table 3) that focuses primarily on whether or not a reasonable
match to each pattern was found. For tools that produce a PWM
representation, the match is reported as the sum of the Euclidean
distances between columns in the known and inferred motifs
(seq d in Table 3) (Gupta et al., 2007), aligned as to produce the

minimum distance. For tools that produce positioning data or
models, the match is reported as the Pearson’s correlation between
the actual and inferred positioning distributions. Best match
consensus patterns are reported for pattern-based tools. The NMF
approach identiﬁes signiﬁcant matches in both positioning and
sequence content for all six inserted motifs in our test set. The best
alternative method was the oligo analysis tools, which return patterns
that reasonably match the consensus patterns of all six inserted
motifs, however, only consensus sequences are returned, with no
distinct positioning information. No other tool produces matches
to more than four of the inserted motifs. Further comparisons are
available in Supplementary Materials.

The principal beneﬁts of the NMF approach come from the focus
on speciﬁc positioning of motifs relative to functional site. Nearly
all pattern recognition tools focus on the identiﬁcation of patterns
that occur more frequently than expected according to a background
model that is generated either from the input sequences themselves,
or from a known background (typically putative promoter regions
reﬂecting the bias of these studies towards transcription factor
binding site identiﬁcation). The test sequences used here were
generated from a relatively AT-rich background. Motifs 3 and 4
(Table 1) do not differ signiﬁcantly from this background. This is
reﬂected in the poor rate at which these motifs were identiﬁed by
the alternative tools tested here (Table 3). From these results, we
conclude that, for the speciﬁc problem of identifying signals with
positioning constraint, NMF outperforms alternative approaches.

3.2 Analysis of biologically interesting sequence sets
-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation) sites Thirty
3.2.1 3
years of study have demonstrated that the sequences that control
(cid:2)
3
-processing in eukaryotic organisms show very distinct positioning
about the 3
-processing site. One recent study postulated up to 15
functional elements in the human 3
-processing signal (Hu et al.,
2005). Based on our analysis of mouse (Fig. 3), and several other
mammals (Supplementary Fig. 7), we ﬁnd ﬁve or possibly six
distinct elements based on positioning speciﬁcity. We observe clear
evidence for two upstream elements: the UGUA-like element and
the canonical AAUAAA-like hexamer, shown as mouse elements 2
and 3, respectively in Figure 3. Downstream, we ﬁnd three elements
that can be described as UG-rich (element 5), U-rich (element 6) and
G-rich (element 7). In addition, as with previous studies, we ﬁnd
some evidence for a putative upstream U-rich element, evidenced
by elements 4 and 6. Elements 1 and 8 are representative of changes

in the background composition in the transition from CDS to UTR
to intergenic region.

Previous comparative studies of 3

-processing sites have shown
both common and distinct features (Lee et al., 2007; Salisbury
et al., 2006) between organisms. We closely examined a number
of organisms, and show the results for a phylogenetically broad
sampling here (Fig. 3),
including mouse, fugu, mosquito and
rice. (Analyses of several additional organisms are available in
Supplementary Fig. 7). Somewhat strikingly, our inclusion of
detailed analysis of positioning constraints reveals a conserved
core pattern in essentially all higher eukaryotes, consisting of
the upstream UGUA (Venkataraman et al., 2005), polyadenylation
signal, with canonical consensus AAUAAA (Proudfoot and
Brownlee, 1976), and downstream U-rich elements (Gil and
Proudfoot, 1987). While it seems apparent that the balance in
importance (and conservation) between these elements has varied,
the basic pattern of these elements remains largely the same in both
sequence content and positioning (Fig. 3).

the downstream UG-rich element

We can also use our analysis to highlight where the 3

-processing
control sequences diverge. As we previously reported (Salisbury
et al., 2006),
is speciﬁc
to metazoans other than nematode. The organisms that have
incorporated a UG-rich element also appear to have a corresponding
shift in the positioning of the downstream U-rich element. The
downstream G-rich element (mouse element 8 in Fig. 3) appears
to be speciﬁc to amniotes (Salisbury et al., 2006). Our analysis of
invertebrate genomic sequences (mosquito, fruit ﬂy and nematode)
indicates the presence of an additional downstream A-rich element
(Fig. 3, mosquito element 7) with positioning similar to the
mammalian G-rich sequences.

(cid:2)

Finally, it is informative to contrast our results with the previous
large-scale analysis of human 3
-processing sites (Hu et al., 2005).
As stated above, the authors of that study identiﬁed 15 distinct motifs
determining 3
-processing site placement, whereas we ﬁnd ﬁve or
six. The previous study used a less speciﬁc positioning classiﬁcation
than ours, initially identifying putative functional sequence words
on the basis of their overrepresentation in one of four positioning
regions, spanning positions −100 to −40, −40 to 0, 0 to +40 and
+40 to +100 relative to the 3
-processing site. These words were
then subsequently clustered on the basis of sequence similarity, and
positional weight matrix representations were generated from the
clusters. A number of their ﬁnal elements, however, show similar
positioning distributions, and sequence patterns that are arguably
close enough to represent variants of a single, more general, pattern
[e.g. Fig. 4 in Hu et al. (2005)]. In contrast, our approach ﬁrst
groups sequence words based on the similarity of positioning at
a signiﬁcantly ﬁner resolution (typically windows of 3–5 nt). In
addition, we beneﬁt from the ‘fuzzy clustering’ nature of NMF,
speciﬁcally in that each sequence word can contribute to the
modeling of multiple elements in a weighted manner. Based on
these differences, we believe that our analysis generates a more
general, inclusive picture of the constraints of the elements of the
(cid:2)
3
-processing site control sequence. We nonetheless leave open the
possibility that the subdivision of these elements, such as generated
previously (Hu et al., 2005), may represent valid subclassiﬁcations
of elements.

3.2.2 Fruitﬂy transcription start sites The elements that comprise
the core promoter in the fruit ﬂy (D.melanogaster) have been the

NMF motif characterization

subject of several recent studies (Gershenzon et al., 2006; Ohler
et al., 2002). Many of the identiﬁed elements displayed positioning
speciﬁcity, indicating an appropriate problem for NMF. We analyzed
2561 core promoter sequences (Gershenzon et al., 2006) extending
from 250-nt upstream to 100-nt downstream of the transcription
start site. Our analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8) identiﬁes a number
of patterns that are consistent with the previous studies, while also
highlighting possible antagonistic relationships.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We have described here a novel approach to the characterization of
putative regulatory motifs, using NMF to simultaneously determine
both positioning and sequence content. In contrast with other
dimension reduction algorithms, the NMF decomposition produces
component matrices with direct intuitive interpretations, reﬂecting
the positioning and sequence content of the resulting elements.
We also demonstrated that variation of the RSS between the
actual and reduced data provides a means of estimating the proper
number of elements. Finally, in contrast with other pattern detection
algorithms, our analysis is explicitly geared to the detection of motifs
with constrained positioning, and consequently outperforms these
algorithms for this speciﬁc problem.

(cid:2)

The motifs generated by the NMF approach are well suited
for inclusion in probabilistic predictive models, such as those for
transcription start site, splice site, 3
-processing site, or full gene
prediction. To this end, we are working to cast the NMF output into
a form that can directly be incorporated with the open-source Genie
software (Kulp et al., 1997; Reese et al., 1997). We discuss a number
of potential improvements to the NMF in Supplementary Materials.
The NMF approach provides a robust and novel approach to
characterization of putative regulatory elements with positioning
speciﬁcity. Given the importance of this additional constraint, our
approach will provide beneﬁts to analyses beyond the few examples
presented here.
