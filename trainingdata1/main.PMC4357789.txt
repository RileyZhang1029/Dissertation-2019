Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for regenerative med-
icine. Generating iPSCs from immunologically immature newborn umbilical cord blood mononu-
clear cells (UCBMCs) is of great signiﬁcance. Here we report generation of human iPSCs with great
efﬁciency from UCBMCs using a dox-inducible lentiviral system carrying four Yamanaka factors.
We generated these cells by optimizing the existing iPSC induction protocol. The UCBMC-derived
iPSCs (UCB-iPSCs) have characteristics that are identical to pluripotent human embryonic stem
cells (hESCs). This study highlights the use of UCBMCs to generate highly functional human iPSCs
that could accelerate the development of cell-based regenerative therapy for patients suffering from
various diseases.

inﬁnite resource for drug screening. When Yamanaka’s [1]
and Thomson’s research groups [2] successfully reprogrammed
human somatic cells to become induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), ethical
issues involved in using human embryonic
stem cells (hESCs) were avoided. For cells to be successfully
used for cell or tissue therapy, a perfect match of human leu-
kocyte antigens (HLAs) [3]
is required between the trans-
planted cells and the recipient patient’s own cells. Since there
is limited availability of early-stage human embryos used for
hESC derivation, it is highly difﬁcult to obtain HLA-matched
hESCs for all patients. Nonetheless, iPSCs can be derived from
the patient’s own somatic cells, thus making it possible to gen-
erate HLA-matched cells for each patient. Scientists have suc-
cessfully reprogrammed several somatic cell types, including
ﬁbroblasts [4,5], keratinocytes [6], extraembryonic tissues [7],

umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCBMCs) [8–13],
peripheral blood cells [13–19] and cells obtained from urine
[20,21], to iPSCs.

Several factors, including the age, origin and type of the
cells used, deeply impact the reprogramming efﬁciency and
the quality of the iPSCs generated [22]. Among all the human
cell types, UCBMCs have many advantages and can be used
successfully to generate iPSCs. First, unlike dermal ﬁbroblasts,
UCBMCs can be readily collected without invasive proce-
dures. Second, accumulated nuclear and mitochondrial muta-
tions are likely to be present in adult cells [23,24]. Such
mutations cannot be corrected during the reprogramming pro-
cess, and likely inﬂuence both the function and the tumor for-
mation risk of iPSCs. In contrast, are young and are expected
to carry few somatic mutations compared with adult cells.
Third, UCBMCs possess low immunogenicity due to their
immunological immaturity. Lastly and most importantly, pri-
mary culture of UCBMCs takes only 1–2 days, whereas pri-
mary culture of placental chorionic mesenchymal cells and
dermal ﬁbroblasts can take more than 10 days. Because the
time period from primary cell collection of UCBMCs to iPSC
formation is short compared with that from other cell types,
and UCBMCs are subjected to less stringent criteria for
HLA-donor–recipient selection compared with other cells, iPS-
Cs derived from UCBMCs have wider potential in cell or tissue
replacement therapy compared with iPSCs derived from adult
cells.

In 2008, scientists successfully reprogrammed mouse B lym-
phocytes into iPSCs [25], paving the way for derivation of iPS-
Cs from blood cells. Shortly after that, two groups reported
that they successfully reprogrammed human cord blood cells
into iPSCs [8,9], providing an easily accessible and valuable
cell source for the generation of iPSCs that could be used in
basic research as well as clinical applications. However, there
are still several problems present in iPSCs generation that need
to be solved. For example, the reported induction efﬁciency is
extremely low. One study indicates that only ﬁve colonies were
obtained from 8 · 104 CD133+ cells [8]. Haase et al. reported
that the exogenous transgenes of their iPSCs were not fully si-
lenced, implying that the iPSCs might not be completely repro-
grammed [9]. Linzhao Cheng’s group used 5 or more factors,
including oncogenes such as SV40LT, to reprogram CD34+
cord blood cells [13]. Aberrantly activation of these oncogenes
would potentially increase the tumor formation risk posed by
iPSCs.

Efﬁciency and safety are the two major issues involved in
clinical applications of iPSCs. Scientists have undertaken ma-
jor work aimed at improving iPSCs induction efﬁciency and
increasing iPSC safety. To improve iPSC induction efﬁciency,
many small molecules have been used in the reprogramming
process, such as valproic acid (VPA) [26], butyrate [27], BIX-
01294 and BayK8644 [28], vitamin C [7] and lithium [29].
Among these small molecules, several, such as histone deace-
tylase inhibitors [26,27] and G9a histone methyltransferase
inhibitors [28], affect the activity of epigenetic regulators.
The molecules applied to modulate epigenetic regulators may
cause off-target effects in iPSCs. For example, when treated
with histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA, embryos that have
been generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer exhibit poor
quality, despite high developmental efﬁciency [30]. Attempts
to increase iPSCs safety have centered on using a minimum
of factors and nonviral methods. For example, it was found

that Oct4 could independently reprogram human epidermal
keratinocytes into iPSCs [31]. Xiao-Bing Zhang’s group has
reprogrammed CD34+ human UCBMCs into iPSCs with high
efﬁciency using an EBNA1-based episomal vector carrying
Oct4 and Sox2 expression constructs. However, the histone
deacetylase inhibitor butyrate was used in the reprogramming
process. Previously, our lab successfully converted primed
hESCs into a naı¨ ve state using X medium [32]. Soon thereafter,
we found that X medium could increase the efﬁciency of pig
iPSC induction without the addition of small molecules that
affect the activity of epigenetic regulators (Gu et al., unpub-
lished data). We reasoned that X medium could reprogram hu-
man UCBMCs
into iPSCs more efﬁciently than could
canonical hESC medium.

Here, we describe reprogramming of human UCBMCs into
iPSCs using a dox-inducible lentiviral system carrying the four
Yamanaka factors with high efﬁciency via a modiﬁed iPSC
induction procedure. These iPSCs met all pluripotency criteria
commonly applied to hESCs. This high-efﬁciency process will
yield safe iPSCs by employing modiﬁed mRNA or proteins
with fewer reprogramming factors, which would further ad-
vance the development of patient-speciﬁc cell therapy using
iPSCs derived from UCBMCs.

Results and discussion

Optimization of human UCBMC culture conditions to generate
iPSCs

Mononuclear cells were suspended in hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) culture medium and iPSCs were adherent in the culture
medium (Figure 1A). To generate human pluripotent stem cells
from UCBMCs, these cells must be made to grow as an adher-
ent population. We tried using several kinds of cellular matrix,
including Matrigel, Cell Start, laminin, gelatin and MesenCult-
XF Attachment Substrate, to induce attachment of UCBMCs
for adherent growth. We found that MesenCult-XF Attach-
ment Substrate had the strongest effects
in promoting
UCBMCs attachment to the surface (Figure 1B). Therefore,
in all our subsequent experiments, we used MesenCult-XF
Attachment Substrate to pre-coat the culture dishes for iPSCs
induction.

Generation of iPSCs from human UCBMCs with
a dox-inducible lentiviral system

It has been demonstrated that adherent cells are easier to
reprogram than suspension cells. As mononuclear cells are
able to attach efﬁciently on MesenCult-XF Attachment Sub-
strate, we supposed that iPSCs could be generated efﬁciently
under this condition. Since cryopreserved umbilical cord blood
was available in the cord blood banks worldwide, we used
cryopreserved UCBMCs
iPSC induction. Human
UCBMCs attached on MesenCult-XF Attachment Substrate
were transduced with expression constructs for Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4 and c-Myc by dox-inducible lentiviral-mediated gene
transfer. Since not all blood mononuclear cells became at-
tached to the MesenCult-XF Attachment Substrate, we specu-
lated that passaging the infected attached blood mononuclear
cells onto feeders would be difﬁcult and that some of the cells
might detach and enter into suspension, which would also

inﬂuence the iPSC generation. Therefore, we attempted to im-
prove the iPSC induction procedure (Figure 1C). Instead of
passaging the infected blood mononuclear cells onto feeders
two days after transduction, we added feeders onto the in-
fected cells. Previously, our lab found that X medium can efﬁ-
ciently induce primed hESCs to assume a naı¨ ve state without
transfection of exogenous genes [32], and, soon after, we found
that X medium can also increase the efﬁciency of pig iPSC
induction (Gu et al. unpublished data). From this observation,
we reason that X medium may also improve the efﬁciency of
human iPSC induction. Thus, we used X medium instead of
the canonical hESC medium in the reprogramming procedure.
Twenty-ﬁve days post infection, colonies with hESC-like mor-
phology emerged and were picked up to generate stable cell
lines.

We used the ratio of the number of ES-like colonies against
the number of input blood mononuclear cells to estimate
reprogramming efﬁciency. In our experiment, 100 colonies
emerged from approximately 1 · 105 cells subjected to the
infection procedure; therefore, the reprogramming efﬁciency
was about 0.1%, which was higher than that reported by
Giorgetti et al. (5 colonies from 8 · 104 CD133+ cells) [8].
Our induction efﬁciency was nearly the same as what Haase
et al. reported [9]. However, they selectively used the cord
blood endothelial cells, whereas we used cord blood mononu-
clear cells without selection of progenitor cells. We presume
that the undivided mononuclear cells in cord blood may inﬂu-
ence the efﬁciency of iPSC induction.

Without using small molecules that modulate epigenetic
regulators, we were able to efﬁciently generate iPSCs from
human UCBMCs by modifying the existing iPSC induction
procedure to employ X medium. This will facilitate derivation
of clinical-grade iPSCs free of exogenous genes. Our lab
found that pig iPSCs can be generated more efﬁciently in X

medium than in the canonical hESC medium. In this study,
using our improved iPSC induction procedure, we failed to
generate iPSC lines in hESC medium but succeeded in gener-
ating iPSCs in X medium, with greater efﬁciency than that re-
ported for other reprogramming media. These results clearly
indicate that X medium is better than hESC medium for the
reprogramming process. Using the X medium, we could try
to generate iPSCs in endangered species such as the giant
panda, Tibetan antelope and tiger in order to study their
developmental processes and mechanisms of drug response,
which could provide information that may be employed to
better protect them.

Human UCB-iPSCs express speciﬁc pluripotency markers

We obtained a total of 18 UCB-iPSC lines and selected three
for further characterization, including 0627-10, 0627-12 and
0702-7.

As early as passage three, the UCB-iPSCs could be main-
tained in the absence of dox, which indicated that the UCB-iPS-
Cs were not dependent on exogenous genes, and the endogenous
pluripotency genes are fully activated. The UCB-iPSCs exhibited
morphology consistent with that of hESCs (Figure 2A). The
0702-7 line was passaged more than 50 times without differenti-
ation and without undergoing apoptosis. These cells expressed
alkaline phosphatase (Figure 2B) and possessed a normal karyo-
type, with 46 (XX) chromosomes (Figure 2C).

RT-PCR results indicated that the UCB-iPSCs expressed
pluripotency genes Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4, Rex1, Lin28a
and Lin28b (Figure 2D). Immunoﬂuorescence results showed
that our UCB-iPSCs expressed the pluripotent markers Oct4,
Sox2, Nanog, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 at
the protein level (Figure 2E).

Human UCB-iPSCs can differentiate into all three germ layers

To verify that UCB-iPSCs generated in our laboratory possess
acquired pluripotency, we used the embryoid body (EB) for-
mation assay. Three independent iPSC lines were grown in sus-
pension without bFGF. All three populations formed round
EBs the next day. Eight days after plating, we collected the
EBs for further study (Figure 3A). RT-PCR analysis showed
that the EBs expressed markers of all three germ layers, ecto-
derm (Gad1 and Pax6), mesoderm (Enolase and Osteonectin)
and endoderm (Nicastrin and Alpha-fetoprotein) (Figure 3B).
Teratoma formation ability is a hallmark characteristic of hu-
man pluripotent stem cells. We injected cells from three inde-
pendent cell lines subcutaneously into SCID mice and found
teratomas in all injected mice after 8 weeks (Figure 3C). Histo-
logical analysis revealed that the teratoma comprised tissues of
all three germ layers, including epithelium (ectoderm), carti-
lage (mesoderm), adipose (mesoderm), muscle (mesoderm),
intestine (endoderm) and gland (endoderm) (Figure 3D).

In summary, we have successfully reprogrammed human
UCBMCs into iPSCs. The obtained UCB-iPSCs exhibited all
pluripotency characteristics and passed the testing criteria that
have been deﬁned for human pluripotent stem cells. Our ﬁnd-
ings strongly indicate that the controllable expression of exog-
enous genes with a dox-inducible system with high efﬁciency
represents an advance toward clinical application of iPSCs in
the near future.

There are still many problems associated with the use of
iPSCs in clinical trials. For example, random insertion of the
exogenous reprogramming genes into the host genome might
inﬂuence the function of the resultant iPSCs. The cancer-re-
lated gene c-Myc, which is among the genes deliberately over-
expressed in the reprogramming of iPSCs, might increase the
neoplastic potential of the iPSCs [33]. Although Xianmei
Meng et al. have successfully reprogrammed human UCBCs
using a pCEP4 EBNA1/OriP-based episomal vector contain-
ing the woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element
(WPRE) and expression constructs for Oct4 and Sox2 [34],

their reprogramming efﬁciency was very low and they did not
test whether the vector was inserted into the genome. These
limitations might inﬂuence the clinical application of their iPS-
Cs. Therefore, our future studies will focus on reprogramming
human UCBMCs into iPSCs via an episomal vector or
mRNA, without using oncogenes but instead using our modi-
ﬁed high efﬁciency reprogramming protocol. This certainly
will provide safe and easily accessible iPSCs for clinical thera-
peutic usage.

Materials and methods

Isolation of mononuclear cells from human umbilical cord blood

Cord blood from healthy volunteers was collected into sterile
blood bags and transported to the laboratory on ice. The blood
was transferred into a T75 sterile culture ﬂask and mixed with
PBS at a 1:1 ratio. Then, 1/4 volume of 0.5% methylcellulose
was added to the cell suspension and the ﬂask was incubated
without shaking for 30 min at room temperature to allow red
blood cells sediment. The supernatant with fewer red blood cells
was collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm at room temperature
for 10 min. Then the cell pellet was collected and resuspended in
PBS, mixed with Ficoll at a 1:1 ratio and centrifuged at 2000 rpm
for 30 min at room temperature. The white middle layer of the
solution, which contained the mononuclear cells, was collected
and the cells were cultured in HSC medium (see below).

Cell culture

bovine

10% fetal

Human UCBMCs were cultured in HSC medium, which con-
tains StemSpan medium (STEMCELL Technologies) supple-
mented with
serum (FBS, Life
Technologies), 50 ng/ml TPO (R&D), 50 ng/ml FL (R&D),
50 ng/ml G-CSF (R&D), 10 ng/ml IL3 (R&D) and 10 ng/ml
IL6 (R&D). Human UCB-iPSCs were initially cultured in X
medium, which was prepared by mixing hESC basic medium
and N2B27 medium at a 1:1 ratio and supplemented with
1000 U/ml mLIF (Millipore) and 10 ng/ml bFGF (R&D).
The hESC basic medium contained knockout-DMEM (Life
Technologies), 20% knockout serum replacement (KOSR, Life
Technologies), 100 lM NEAA (Life Technologies), 2 mM L-glu-
tamine (Life Technologies), 55 lM b-mercaptoethanol
(Life
Technologies) and 1000 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Tech-
nologies). The N2B27 medium was prepared as previously de-
scribed [35]. Brieﬂy, knockout-DMEM supplemented with N2
(Life Technologies) was combined at a 1:1 ratio with Neurobasal
Medium supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies), to which was
added NEAA (Life Technologies) at 100 lM, L-glutamine (Life
Technologies) at 2 mM, b-mercaptoethanol (Life technologies) at
55 lM, penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 1000 U/ml
and bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) at 2.5 lg/ml. At passage
5–10, the cells were transferred to hESC basic medium supplemented
with 10 ng/ml bFGF. 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (high
glucose) and supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 lM NEAA,
2 mM L-glutamine and 1000 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

Lentivirus production

Cell culture dishes were coated with 0.1 mg/ml PDL (Sigma)
for 2 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS afterward. These

pre-coated dishes were used to culture 293T cells. Cells were
plated at 6 · 106 cells in a 100-mm pre-coated dish and incu-
bated at 37 °C overnight. Before transfection, medium was re-
moved and replaced with 7.0 ml opti-MEM medium (Life
Technologies) per 100-mm dish. 293T cells were transfected
with 8 lg PSPAX (Addgene), 4 lg PMD.2G (Addgene) and
12 lg FUW vectors carrying one of the four Yamanaka factors
per 100-mm culture dish using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus
reagents (Life Technologies). The transfection was done
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Twelve hours post
transfection, the transfection medium was removed and 15 ml
of DMEM medium (high glucose) with 1% FBS was added per
100-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, the supernatant was
collected as the ﬁrst virus-containing medium and replenished
with 15 ml of fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 1%
FBS, which was collected after another 24 h as the second
virus-containing supernatant. The virus-containing superna-
tant was ﬁltered through a ﬁlter with the pore size of
0.45 lm (Millipore) and centrifuged in Amicon Ultra-15 Cen-
trifugal Filter Units with Ultracel-100 membrane (Millipore)
at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris and con-
centrate the virus. The concentrated virus was stored at
 80 °C for subsequent use.

Induction of iPSCs from human UCBMCs

UCBMCs were cultured in 12-well sterile culture plates pre-
coated with MesenCult-XF Attachment Substrate in HSC
medium without antibodies. Each of the four concentrated len-
tiviral supernatants was added to the culture medium at the
dosage of 10 ll per well. Eight lg/ml polybrene (Sigma) was
added to the medium to enhance the infection efﬁciency.
Twenty-four hours post transduction, the virus-containing
supernatant was removed and HSC medium was added. After
24 h, the HSC medium was replaced with X medium and
1 · 105 feeder cells were added to each well. The medium
was changed every day. The developed colonies were picked
25–40 days post transduction and mechanically dissociated
with a needle to yield small clumps. Finally, the small clumps
were transferred into 24-well plates with feeders and X
medium.

Alkaline phosphatase staining

Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using the
Alkaline Phosphatase Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction.

Immunoﬂuorescence staining

Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room
temperature and washed with PBS three times. Then, the cells
were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for
1 h for permeabilization. After being washed three times with
PBS, the cells were blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h at room tem-
perature. Primary antibodies against OCT4 (1:200 Santa),
SOX2 (1:200, Millipore), NANOG (1:200, Abnova), SSEA-3
(1:200, Millipore), SSEA-4 (1:200, Millipore), TRA-1-60
(1:200, Millipore) and TRA-1-81(1:200, Millipore) were diluted
in 2% BSA and applied to the cells, which were then incubated at
4 °C overnight. After incubation, cells were washed three times

(for 5 min each time) with PBS, and then secondary antibodies
including donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to
Cy3 (1:200, Jackson), donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to
Cy5 (1:200, Jackson), donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to Cy5
(1:200, Jackson) and donkey anti-rat IgG conjugated to Cy3
(1:200, Jackson) diluted in 2% BSA were applied to the cells,
which were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Finally,
cells were washed three times with PBS (for 5 min each time).
Cells nuclei were stained with 1 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitro-

Total RNA from UCB-iPSCs was extracted with Trizol re-
agent (Life Technologies) using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Pro-
mega) to remove genomic DNA. Then the RNA was reversely
transcribed to cDNA with random primers using M-MLV
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. PCR
was performed in a 25 ll solution containing 12.5 ll 2X Es-
Taq Master Mix
forward primer
(10 lM), 0.5 ll reverse primer (10 lM), 1 ll cDNA and 10 ll
water. The PCR reaction was performed in a thermal cycler
at 95 °C for 5 min for 1 cycle; 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s
and 72 °C for 30 s for a total number of 30 cycles; 72 °C for
10 min for 1 cycle and followed by holding at 4 °C. The
PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Primer se-
quences used in the experiments are shown in Table S1.

EB and teratoma formation

For the EB formation assay, the conﬂuent cells were dissoci-
ated into small clumps using 1 mg/ml dispase (Life Technolo-
gies). The dissociated small clumps were then cultured in low-
attachment dishes using hESC basic medium without added
growth factors. The day after plating, the cells were transferred
into a new dish to remove attached cells and the medium was
changed every other day. Eight days later, the EBs were col-
lected to extract RNA and test for expression of differentia-
tion-related genes.

For the teratoma formation assay, conﬂuent cells in a 6-
well plate were harvested by dispase, then collected into tubes,
centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 2 min and resuspended in 100 ll
PBS. The cells were then injected subcutaneously into SCID
mice. The mice were sacriﬁced 8 weeks after injection accord-
ing to the guidelines and regulations of the Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The teratomas were
ﬁxed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, sliced and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
