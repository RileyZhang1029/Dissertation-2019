ABSTRACT
Summary: Amino acid residues are under various kinds of local
environmental
restraints, which inﬂuence substitution patterns.
Ulla,1 a program for calculating environment-speciﬁc substitution
tables, reads protein sequence alignments and local environment
annotations. The program produces a substitution table for every
possible combination of environment
features. Sparse data is
handled using an entropy-based smoothing procedure to estimate
robust substitution probabilities.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the evolution of proteins, individual amino acid residues are under
various kinds of local environmental restraints such as secondary
structure type, solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding patterns.
Previous study of amino acid substitutions as a function of
local environment has showed that
there are clear differences
among substitution patterns under various environmental restraints
(Overington et al., 1992). The unique patterns of amino acid
substitutions have been successfully exploited to predict the stability
of protein mutants (Topham et al., 1993), to identify potential
interaction sites (Chelliah et al., 2004; Gong and Blundell, 2008)
and to detect remote sequence-structure homology (Chelliah et al.,
2005).

However, estimating amino acid substitution probabilities is
not a trivial problem, especially when there are a very small
number of observations in speciﬁc combinations of environments.
To cope with the sparse data problem, an algorithm was developed
by Sali (1991) as an extension of the method used by Sippl
(1990) to derive robust potentials of mean force. Several variants
of the generalized procedure such as Makesub (Topham et al.,
1993) and SUBST (Mizuguchi, unpublished results) have been
subsequently implemented for smoothing substitution probabilities.
Nevertheless, each lacks crucial features implemented in the

other, and they use slightly different procedures for smoothing
substitution probabilities, which may lead to very different amino
acid substitution matrices.

To overcome these problems, we developed Ulla, a program
for calculating environment-speciﬁc substitution tables (ESSTs), to
unify all the major features of the previously developed programs
and to provide additional functionalities. The program also generates
heat maps from substitution tables to visualize the degree of
conservation of amino acids under the environmental restraints.

2 DESCRIPTION
Ulla reads multiple sequence alignments and annotations for local
environments in JOY template format (Mizuguchi et al., 1998a).
Users can provide their own deﬁnition of environment features, and
an environment feature can be constrained to count substitutions
only when the environment of residues is conserved. Ulla also
supports conﬁning percent identity (PID) range of sequence pairs to
be considered and uses BLOSUM-like weighting scheme (Henikoff
and Henikoff, 1992) to minimize sampling bias from highly similar
sequences.

Ulla uses entropy-based smoothing procedures

to reduce
problems caused by sparse data. It
is an iterative procedure
that estimates probability distribution by perturbing the previous
probability distribution with the successive measurement (Sali,
1991; Sippl, 1990). Hence, starting from a uniform frequency
distribution,
the estimated probability distribution at each step
serves as an approximation for the next probability distribution (see
Supplementary Material for details).

3 EXAMPLE USAGE
As an illustration, we generate ESSTs
from HOMSTRAD
alignments (Mizuguchi et al., 1998b) with environment feature
deﬁnitions of secondary structure type and solvent accessibility
(Fig. 1a):

# values adopted in .tem (alignment) file (string);\\
# class labels assigned for each value (string);\\

Ulla: a program for calculating environment-speciﬁc amino acid substitution tables

Ulla produces three different types of substitution tables: raw counts
tables, substitution probability tables and log-odds ratio tables. Heat
maps also can be generated to visualize resultant substitution tables
(Fig. 1b).

4 CONCLUSION
Ulla generates ESSTs from a sparse data set using entropy-based
smoothing procedures. It allows us to conduct analyses of amino
acid substitution patterns under various environmental restraints.
The resultant ESSTs can be exploited in many ways such as binding
site prediction, remote homology detection, and protein stability
estimation.
