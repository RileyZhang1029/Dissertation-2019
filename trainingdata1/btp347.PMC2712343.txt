ABSTRACT
Summary: Due to the availability of new sequencing technologies,
we are now increasingly interested in sequencing closely related
strains of existing ﬁnished genomes. Recently a number of de novo
and mapping-based assemblers have been developed to produce
high quality draft genomes from new sequencing technology reads.
New tools are necessary to take contigs from a draft assembly
through to a fully contiguated genome sequence. ABACAS is
intended as a tool to rapidly contiguate (align, order, orientate),
visualize and design primers to close gaps on shotgun assembled
contigs based on a reference sequence. The input to ABACAS is a set
of contigs which will be aligned to the reference genome, ordered and
orientated, visualized in the ACT comparative browser, and optimal
primer sequences are automatically generated.
Availability and Implementation: ABACAS is implemented in Perl
and is freely available for download from http://abacas.sourceforge.

1 INTRODUCTION
The recent development of ultra high-throughput sequencing
technologies has led to a huge increase in the number of genome
sequencing projects being carried out (Mardis and Elaine, 2008).
For small genomes, it is now possible to obtain high sequencing
coverage with a single run of a new sequencing machine. Therefore
there is widespread interest in sequencing large numbers of closely
related species or strains where a high quality reference sequence
already exists, for instance, to explore population structure and
genetic variation. A number of new assemblers have been developed
for carrying out both de novo and mapped assemblies from new
technology reads (Chaisson et al. 2004; Miller et al. 2008). However,
a signiﬁcant amount of manual intervention is still required to go
from a set of contigs to fully contiguated sequence.

The problem of rapidly contiguating draft assemblies has existed
since the inception of genome sequencing. A number of tools
have previously been developed for this purpose such as Bambus
(Pop et al. 2004), BACCardI (Bartels et al. 2005), Projector2
(van Hijum et al. 2005) and OSLay (Richter et al. 2007).
Ideally, automatic contiguation programs consist of two major

parts; ordering and orientating contigs based on a reference and
closing gaps between ordered contigs. Bambus requires users to
provide linking information between contigs generated from various
methods including mapping of contigs to a related genome. Post
processing of the resulting set of scaffolds is required to generate
a pseudomolecule and close gaps. BACCardI provides support in
genome ﬁnishing by scaffolding contigs based on virtual clone maps
alongside other features. Projector2 is a web service application for
closing gaps in prokaryotic genome assemblies. The most recent
tool in the area, OSLay requires a mapping ﬁle between a reference
(or a set of contigs) and sets of contigs to ﬁnd synteny. The results
could be used as inputs to the assembly viewer Consed (Gordon
et al. 1998) to design primers.

ABACAS is a stand alone program intended to rapidly contiguate
(align, order, orientate), visualize and design primers to close gaps
on shotgun assembled contigs based on a reference sequence. Some
of the features of ABACAS include showing ambiguous contigs or
overlapping contigs, visualizing repetitive regions, considering base
qualities of contigs for primer design and enabling users to drag and
drop contigs.

2 METHODS
Figure 1 describes the overall pipeline implemented in ABACAS. It uses
MUMmer (Kurtz et al. 2004) to ﬁnd alignment positions and identify areas
of synteny of the contigs against the reference. The output is then processed
to generate a pseudomolecule taking overlapping contigs and gaps in to
account. MUMmer’s alignment programs, Nucmer and Promer, are used
followed by the ‘delta-ﬁlter’ and ‘show-tiling’ utilities.

Gaps in the pseudomolecule are represented by N’s. ABACAS
automatically extracts gaps on the pseudomolecule and, based on ﬂanking
sequences above a base quality threshold, designs primers for gap closure
using Primer3 (Koressaar and Remm 2007). As part of the primer design step
the uniqueness of the sequence is checked by running a sensitive NUCmer
alignment. ABACAS allows users to adjust parameters such as melting
temperature, size, ﬂanking region and size of contig ends to exclude from
picking primers. It then produces a list of sense and antisense primer oligos
as well as a detailed Primer3 output that contains additional information on
each gap position.

ABACAS generates a comparison ﬁle that can be used to visualize
ordered and oriented contigs in ACT, the Artemis Comparison Tool (Carver
et al. 2008). Synteny is represented by red bars where colour intensity
decreases with lower values of percent identity between comparable blocks.
Information on contigs such as the orientation, percent identity, coverage

(14 chromosomes). To give a quantitative example of the results, in
the Plasmodium berghei chromosome 2 ﬁnishing effort, the number
of contigs was reduced from 60 to 36 with nine potential joins via
ABACAS. Forty-six PCR products were generated to close gaps
and 38 of these were successful in closing gaps in the assembly.
In C. difﬁcle cdbi1, the initial number of contigs larger than 2 kb
was reduced from 37 to 10 after PCR and primer walks. On the
other hand, the six contigs of C. difﬁcle cd196 were contiguated to
a single contig based on primers suggested by ABACAS. The main
difference compared to existing tools is the possibility to include
ABACAS in a high-throughput automated workﬂow. In summary,
ABACAS is primarily used in post-assembly applications as a
ﬁnishing tool. It is used both to generate high quality reference-
based genome scaffolds and to assist ﬁnishing efforts by directing
primer design. At the Sanger institute, ABACAS has been included
in the production pipeline to automatically ﬁnish draft assemblies.
Ongoing work includes improving mapping of contigs in highly
divergent species.

and overlap with other contigs can also be visualized by loading the output
feature ﬁle on ACT. Contigs that were not mapped can be included separately.
Repetitive regions in the reference can also be identiﬁed using a MUMmer
self-comparison and visualized in ACT alongside quality of the contigs.

If all of the contigs are not mapped, there is an option to run tBLASTx
(Altschul et al. 1997) on contigs that are not included in the pseudomolecule
using sequences from the reference that correspond to the gaps. Additional
contigs to the pseudomolecule can be dragged and dropped to the correct
position using ACT.

3 IMPLEMENTATON
ABACAS is implemented in Perl and requires MUMmer and
(optionally) BLAST installed on the local machine. The user
supplies a FASTA ﬁle of contigs and a reference genome in FASTA
format. As the program can be used in an iterative process of
contiguating a genome sequence, the output ﬁles produced after
each running of the program can be fed back into the program as
input.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ABACAS has already been used on a number of eukaryote
and prokaryote genome projects at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute. Prokaryote
include Escherichia
coli 8178, Escherichia coli K88, Escherichia coli K99,
Yersinia enterocolitica—ﬁve biotypes, Clostridium difﬁcle and
Mycobacterium canetti. It is also being used to ﬁnish a number
of eukaryote genomes of Babesia bigemina (four chromosomes),
Trypanosoma vivax (11 chromosomes) and Plasmodium Berghei
