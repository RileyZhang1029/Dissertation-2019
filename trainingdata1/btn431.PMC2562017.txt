ABSTRACT
Summary: We report a previously uncharacterized CHHC Zn-ﬁnger
domain identiﬁed in spliceosomal U11-48K proteins, tRNA methyl-
transferases TRM13 and gametocyte speciﬁc factors. We show that
this domain behaves as an independent folding unit and that it
stoichiometrically binds zinc in a one-to-one ratio. Based on the
conserved sequence features we predict that this domain may
function as a RNA recognition and binding module.

1 INTRODUCTION
Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in gene expression. In
higher eukaryotes pre-mRNA introns are removed by two distinct
spliceosomes. The majority of
introns are excised by the
U2-dependent (major) spliceosome that consists of ﬁve small
ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 and a
large number of protein splicing factors. A subset of eukaryotic
organisms contains a second class of introns, the so-called U12-
introns. Although the U12-introns constitute a small fraction of all
introns (<1%), they have been identiﬁed in various genes implicated
in biologically important processes such as DNA replication and
repair, transcription, translation, signal transduction and cell cycle
control (Burge et al., 1998; Levine et al., 2001). It has been shown
that many genes contain both U2- and U12-introns. The U12-introns
are recognized by the minor U12-type spliceosome that is formed
by the U11, U12 U4atac/U6atac snRNPs and the U5 snRNP, which
is common to both spliceosomes.

Both major and minor spliceosomes share similar assembly
pathways and catalytic mechanisms. Despite these similarities, the
two splicing systems display several fundamental differences. In
contrast to U1 and U2 snRNPs, U11 and U12 exist mainly as an
18S U11/U12 di-snRNP complex. The U2-dependent spliceosome
(cid:2)
assembly is initiated by the interaction of U1 snRNP with the 5
splice site followed by the association of U2 snRNP with the branch
point site of the pre-mRNA. In the U12-dependent assembly, the
18S U11/U12 di-snRNP binds simultaneously to the 5
splice and
branch point site (Frilander et al., 1999).

Both splicing systems share common protein components, but
there are proteins that are unique to the minor spliceosome (Will
et al., 2004). These include seven proteins with molecular weight
20, 25, 31, 35, 48, 59 and 65 kDa. Four of them (25K, 35K, 48K
and 59K) have been shown to associate with the 12S U11 snRNP
(cid:2)
and probably play a role in the U11/U12 snRNP assembly and/or 5
splice site recognition.

In contrast

to the major spliceosome,

the U12-dependent
spliceosome is less extensively studied and limited information is
available about its protein components and their function. Here,
we show that the minor spliceosomal protein U11-48K contains a
genuine CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain. We also demonstrate that this
domain is similar and probably evolutionarily related to the Zn-
ﬁnger domains identiﬁed in the TRM13 tRNA modifying enzymes
and gametocyte speciﬁc factors.

2 METHODS
Protein sequence comparisons and database searches were performed with
BLAST suite v.2.2.18 (Altschul et al., 1997). Pattern search was carried out
with PHI-BLAST (Zhang et al., 1998). Two-step PSI-BLAST searches were
performed as described before (Andreeva et al., 2008). TBLASTN was used
to scan nucleotide and EST databases at NCBI and ENSEMBL in order to
identify additional protein homologs. Initial clustering of protein sequences
was performed using BLASTCLUST. Multiple sequence alignments were
constructed and analysed using Jalview (Clamp et al., 2004). Analysis
of protein disorder and compositionally biased regions were performed
with PONDR (Romero et al., 2001) and SEG (Wootton et al., 1996),
respectively.

The DNA encoding the second exon of human U11-48K corresponding to
residues 53–87 (the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain) was cloned into a pRSET-
derived vector containing an N-terminal fusion of His6-tag,
lipoamyl
domain and TEV protease cleavage site to generate the plasmid pHLT-
ZnF U11-48K. The plasmid was transformed in Escherichia coli C41 cells
(Miroux and Walker, 1996) and the protein was expressed for 12 h at
22˚C. The U11-48K Zn-ﬁnger domain was ﬁrst puriﬁed using Ni-afﬁnity
chromatography followed by TEV protease cleavage. The next steps of
puriﬁcation included a second Ni-column to separate the cleaved fusion
partner and a ﬁnal gel ﬁltration. Protein homogeneity and purity was assessed
using mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE.

Zinc binding of U11-48K was determined using the PAR/PMPS assay
as previously described (Hunt et al., 1985). For a detailed description of
this method and other biophysical methods used in this study, refer to the

3 RESULTS
3.1 Domain identiﬁcation and phyletic distribution
Multiple sequence alignment constructed from U11-48K homologs
revealed a highly conserved region containing four invariant Cys
and His residues. Using a consensus pattern C-P-X(4)-H-X(9)-H-
X(3)-C derived from the alignment and the conserved region of
human U11-48K as a query sequence we performed a PHI-BLAST
search (E-value threshold of 200) against NR database. The pattern
search retrieved similar segments from∼190 proteins. Some of these
proteins produced two distinct matches, suggesting that this region
is tandemly repeated. Despite the insigniﬁcant PHI-BLAST scores,
all identiﬁed fragments had a high sequence identity (>30%) with
the query sequence.

In order to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the PHI-BLAST results,
we initially clustered the full-length sequences matching the
pattern. Multiple alignments generated for each distinct cluster
were evaluated for the presence of common sequence motifs.
Based on the observed conserved features we further reﬁned and
merged the initial clusters. In addition, we performed iterative PSI-
BLAST searches (proﬁle inclusion threshold of 0.01) against the
NR database using representative sequences from each cluster as
queries. These searches yielded the identiﬁcation of new homologs
with similar separation of the Cys- and His-residues (full list of the
identiﬁed sequences is provided in the Supplementary Material). The
proﬁle searches also indicated a number of false positives (7.8%
of all PHI-BLAST hits) in some singleton clusters and they were
excluded from further consideration.

As a result, we obtained three clusters corresponding to three
distinct protein families. Besides the U11-48K family, these include
the families of tRNA methyltransferase TRM13 and gametocyte
speciﬁc factors GTSF (also known as UPF0224), both named
after their only experimentally characterized members. The TRM13
family is typiﬁed by the yeast protein YOL125w (Genbank
identiﬁer gi:74676591) that catalyses the 2
O-methylation of tRNA,
whereas the GTSF family is represented by the D7 protein
(gi:118217) and Cue110 (gi:29244024) that are preferentially
expressed in germinal tissues. The common region (∼30 residues)
containing the conserved pattern was present in a single copy
in all
identiﬁed U11-48K and TRM13 homologs. All GTSF
homologs contained two repeats of this motif separated by a short
linker.

(cid:2)

ion
Cys- and His-residues are usually involved in metal
coordination. Given the size of the identiﬁed fragments,
their
repetitive nature and strict conservation of Cys- and His-residues,
it is likely that this region represents an independent domain folded
around a central zinc ion. Therefore, hereafter we refer to it as a
CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain.

The CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domains were found only in eukaryotes.
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of all identiﬁed Zn-
ﬁnger domains showed that they diverge in four main clusters that to
a large extent correspond to the U11-48K, TRM13 and GTSF protein
families. Homologs of U11-48K were found in vertebrates, plants
and insects that are known to contain U12-type introns. Analysis
of the genomic and EST databases revealed previously unreported
orthologs in Schistosoma mansoni, Biomphalaria glabrata, Hirudoo
medicinalis and Ciona intestinalis. The presence of U11-48K in
these organisms is consistent with the proposed early evolution of
the minor spliceosome (Russell et al., 2006). U12-type introns have

2278

been identiﬁed in some protists and fungi, but we were unable to
detect U11-48K relatives in these genomes.

In contrast to U11-48K, the TRM13 family is more ubiquitous
and present in protozoa, fungi, plants and metazoa. We found that
in some amoebozoan genomes, in particular Entamoeba dispar
and Entamoeba histolytica, the TRM13 gene is duplicated. The
yeast TRM13 is responsible for the 2
-O-methylation of ribose
in the position 4 of tRNAPro,His,Gly (Wilkinson et al., 2007).
Apparently, this modiﬁcation is highly conserved in eukaryotes,
including humans, and can account for the high conservation and
wide distribution of TRM13 enzymes.

(cid:2)

GTSF homologs were found in two protozoan, Tetrahymena
thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia, and a vast number of
metazoan genomes. No orthologs were identiﬁed in fungi and plants.
In most of the genomes, the predicted GTSF gene is present in
multiple copies, but some lineages have a single copy of this
gene (Supplementary Material). The P. tetraurelia, for instance,
possesses three predicted GTSF homologs, whereas T. thermophila
has only one. A recent analysis of the P. tetraurelia genome suggests
that Paramecium lineage probably underwent at least three whole-
genome duplications (Aury et al., 2006). Thus the presence of two or
more GTSF copies in the genomes can account for a gene duplication
event that had happened early in the eukaryotic evolution. This also
suggests a plausible evolutionary scenario that includes an early
duplication and fusion of the Zn-ﬁnger domain followed by multiple
gene duplications. The metazoan GTSF-like proteins formed two
paralogous subfamilies (named GTSF-FamA and GTSF-FamB) with
distinct sequence motifs and predicted gene structure. The duplicated
CHHC Zn-ﬁnger motif in GTSF-FamA corresponds to a single exon,
whereas each Zn-ﬁnger domain in GTSF-FamB is encoded by an
individual exon. Similar domain-exon correlation was observed in
all U11-48K homologs. These ﬁndings suggests that the Zn-ﬁnger
domain might be a minimal unit of evolution and events such as exon
shufﬂing may have contributed to the architectural and functional
diversity observed in the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger containing proteins.

3.2 Domain features and architectures
The CHHC Zn-ﬁnger does not show sequence similarity to any
known or previously characterized Zn-ﬁnger domain. Multiple
alignment of all identiﬁed CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domains indicated
several conserved residues, some of which may contribute to the fold
stability (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material, Fig. 1). Besides the
strictly conserved Cys- and His-residues, residues with hydrophobic
side-chains tend to occupy positions 1, 2, 6, 14, 19 and 23. Highly
conserved are a Pro residue at position 5 and Asp/Asn (Asx) at
position 7. Asx and Pro are usually found in turns. The high
conservation of these residues in the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domains
may reﬂect a requirement for a speciﬁc backbone conformation.
The multiple alignment also revealed several clusters of positively
charged residues that may have a functional role. In Znf1-GTSF, all
vertebrate U11-48K and nearly all TRM13 Zn-ﬁnger domains these
residues were located near the C-termini. The amoebozoan TRM13
and the Znf2-GTSF Zn-ﬁnger domains had very distinct patterns of
basic residues that could account for different function.

With the exception of TRM13, the other two protein families had
very simple domain architectures with one or two Zn-ﬁnger domains
as their only globular domains (Supplementary Material, Fig. 2).
We found that the amino acid composition of U11-48K proteins

Novel CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain

For instance, human U11-48K is enriched with E, R, K and S as
much as 2.0-, 2.2-, 1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively. This analysis was
supported by the prediction of nearly 55% protein disorder with
PONDR and the identiﬁcation of two long low-complexity regions
at the N- and C-terminus with SEG. Taken together, this suggests
that the central part containing the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger is probably the
only region of folded globular structure.

In addition to the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain, the TRM13 proteins
contain a putative CCCH-type Zn-ﬁnger and methyltransferase
domain (Pfam domain PF05206, Finn et al., 2006). Using a
transitive sequence database search we were able to detect
similarity between the TRM13 methyltransferase domain and
classical methyltransferases. This result was conﬁrmed by two-
step iterative PSI-BLAST search that retrieved with signiﬁcant
E-values a number of methyltransferase domains classiﬁed in SCOP
(e.g. d1p91a_ with E = 1e-34, d1kpga_ with E = 1e-31, d1sqga2
with E = 4e-14; SCOP Superfamily sunid = 53335). A combination
of Zn-ﬁnger and methyltransferase domains is not uncommon. It
is found, for instance, in another family of RNA modiﬁcation
enzymes, RlmAI/RlmAII, that catalyzes the methylation of the 23S
rRNA nucleotides G745/G748 in g–/g+ bacteria, respectively. The
Zn-ﬁnger domain in these enzymes is thought to be responsible for
the speciﬁc recognition and binding to the rRNA substrate (Das
et al., 2004).

3.3 Biochemical characterization
We have cloned and expressed the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger of the human
U11-48K protein. The CD spectrum indicates that the puriﬁed
domain is partly structured. The 1D-NMR spectrum shows several
resonances beyond 8.5 p.p.m. (up to 9.3 p.p.m.), which clearly
demonstrates that the domain is folded and thus provides evidence
that the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger can exist as an independent folding
unit (Supplementary Material, Fig. 3). By using colorimetric zinc-
binding assay, we conﬁrm that the predicted CHHC Zn-ﬁnger
domain indeed binds zinc. Our results show that it stoichiometrically
binds zinc ions in a one-to-one ratio (Fig. 2).

3.4 Probable biological function
The CHHC Zn-ﬁnger motif may possess a RNA binding function.
This prediction arises from the fact that this domain is present in
two proteins known to bind RNA (U11-48K and TRM13) and that it
contains the sequence determinants that can mediate this function.
OH in
position 4 of tRNAPro, tRNAHis and tRNAGly. This is one of the few
modiﬁcations found in the middle of duplex RNA and one of only
four modiﬁcations that occur in the acceptor stem of the tRNA.
Binding to tRNA is crucial for the enzyme selectivity and substrate
recognition. TRM13 binds with high afﬁnity to its cognate substrates
but exhibits no detectable binding to other tRNA species (Wilkinson
et al., 2007). It is conceivable that the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain may
mediate this selective binding by recognizing a speciﬁc shape or
particular structure of the cognate tRNAs. It may also contribute
to the correct positioning of the substrate tRNA in the enzyme
active site.

signiﬁcantly differs from the average amino acid composition
observed in globular domains (data not shown). These proteins are
enriched in disorder promoting residues (Q, R, S, P, E, K) and have
a low content of order promoting residues (Dunker et al., 2001).

During the preparation of this article, Turunen et al. (2008)
reported that U11-48K protein contacts the 5
splice site in the
early spliceosomal complex and that this interaction requires U11-
(cid:2)

ss base-pairing as a prerequisite. Besides the conserved Zn-ﬁnger

domain, U11-48K contains a strictly conserved, probably non-
globular region rich in basic residues that can potentially bind to
RNA. Having in mind that the 5
splice site is highly conserved in
the U12-type introns, two hypotheses can account for the interaction
of U11-48K with the 5
splice site. One possibility is that the non-
globular region of U11-48K mediates this interaction. Alternatively,
the CHHC Zn-ﬁnger domain may directly contact the 5
splice site
and thereby contribute to the U12-intron recognition.

(cid:2)

The molecular function of the GTSF family is unknown, but the
presence of two copies of a CHHC Zn-ﬁnger motif allows function
prediction. Two members of this protein family, the xenopus protein
D7 and mouse Cue110, are preferentially expressed in gametocytes
and are localized in the cytoplasm (Smith et al., 1988; Yoshimura
et al., 2007). We propose that these proteins may play a role in the
storage of maternal and paternal RNA that is synthesized in large
amounts during early gametogenesis.

4 CONCLUSIONS
The CHHC Zn-ﬁnger is a novel domain present in spliceosomal U11-
48K proteins, TRM13 enzymes and gametocyte speciﬁc factors. Our
experimental analysis conﬁrms that this domain is a genuine Zn-
binding module that in isolation behaves as an independent folding
unit. Based on the conserved sequence features, we predict that this
domain may function as a RNA recognition and binding module.
Future analysis will aim to structurally characterize this domain and
to elucidate its molecular function.
