Abstract The initiation factor eIF5A in Trichomonas vaginalis (TveIF5A) is previously shown to
undergo hypusination, phosphorylation and glycosylation. Three different pI isoforms of TveIF5A
have been reported. The most acidic isoform (pI 5.2) corresponds to the precursor TveIF5A,
whereas the mature TveIF5A appears to be the most basic isoform (pI 5.5). In addition, the inter-
mediary isoform (pI 5.3) is found only under polyamine-depleted conditions and restored with
exogenous putrescine. We propose that differences in PI are due to phosphorylation of the TveIF5A
isoforms. Here, we have identiﬁed phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry. The mature
TveIF5A contains four phosphorylated residues (S3, T55, T78 and T82). Phosphorylation at S3
and T82 is also identiﬁed in the intermediary TveIF5A, while no phosphorylated residues are found
in the precursor TveIF5A. It has been demonstrated that eIF5A proteins from plants and yeast are
phosphorylated by a casein kinase 2 (CK2). Interestingly, a gene encoding a protein highly similar
to CK2 (TvCK2) is found in T. vaginalis, which might be involved in the phosphorylation of
TveIF5A in T. vaginalis.

Introduction

The precursor eIF5A undergoes a speciﬁc spermidine-depen-
dent post-translational modiﬁcation known as hypusination
for eIF5A activation [2]. During hypusination, a unique amino
acid, Ne-(4-aminobutyl-2-hydroxyl) lysine, called hypusine, is
generated by transferring the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine
to a speciﬁc lysine residue in precursor eIF5A [2]. Both the ly-
sine residue and the ﬂanking residues are conserved among
eukaryotes [3]. Hypusine is exclusively synthesized in precursor
eIF-5A [3]. Besides hypusination, eIF5A proteins are phos-
phorylated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (eIF5Ab) [4,5] and
maize (ZmeIF5A). The phosphorylation in ZmeIF5A occurs
at serine residue 2 (S2) [6]. Interestingly, eIF5A is represented
by more than one isoforms in Plasmodium falciparum, presum-
ably due to post-translational modiﬁcations [7]. Expression of

two eIF5A isoforms was decreased modestly during schizont
development, while expression of another isoform with a con-
siderably more acidic isoelectric point (pI) was increased 15-
fold and demonstrated a signiﬁcant fold change during the
proteomic analysis of P. falciparum at various developmental
stages [7].

eIF5A from Trichomonas vaginalis (TveIF5A) is of archae-
bacterial origin [8]. T. vaginalis is the protozoan parasite respon-
sible for trichomonosis, which is the most common sexually
transmitted infection. Trichomonosis is associated with an in-
creased risk of human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection
[9], pelvic inﬂammatory disease [10] and adverse pregnancy out-
comes [11]. Our previous studies reported that two spots with
different isoelectric points (pI) (5.2 and 5.5) were detected in
the T. vaginalis protein extracts. These two spots corresponded
to the precursor (pI 5.2) and mature TveIF5A (pI 5.5), respec-
tively [8], and the mature isoform contains the hypusine residue
[12]. Interestingly, when putrescine biosynthesis was inhibited in
T. vaginalis using 1,4-diamino-2-butanone (DAB) and the para-
sites were then transferred to a medium containing exogenous
putrescine, a new TveIF5A spot with a pI of 5.3 was observed
[12]. According to sequencing analysis, these three isoforms
shared identical primary structures; however, the precursor
and intermediate isoforms were 19 kDa, while the mature iso-
form was 20 kDa, which is phosphorylated and glycosylated
[12]. Moreover, in silico analyses of the precursor isoform indi-
cated that serine residues S3, S21, S83 and S153, threonine (T)
residues T78 and T114, and tyrosine (Y) residues Y37 and Y96
are potential phosphorylation sites [12]. In this study, we went
further to identify the phosphorylated residues in TveIF5A
using LC–MS/MS. We found that mature TveIF5A contains
four phosphorylated residues, S3, T55, T78 and T82; among
which S3 and T82 were also phosphorylated in the intermediary
isoforms, whereas no phosphorylated residues were identiﬁed in
the precursor TveIF5A.

Results

T. vaginalis was grown in TYM-serum medium (control) or
transferred into a medium containing exogenous putrescine
after DAB treatment (DAB-treated). The extracted proteome
was subjected to 2D gel separation and an identical gel was
immunoblotted for the identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc spots
immunorecognized by the anti-TveIF5A antibodies. In this re-
port, we focused on the 25–15 kDa region to identify phos-
phorylation sites in the three TveIF5A isoforms (Figure 1).
For the parasites grown in the control medium, spots that were
immunorecognized by the anti-peptide TveIF5A antibody cor-
responded to the precursor and mature TveIF5A isoforms
with pIs of 5.2 and 5.5, respectively (Figure 1A). As expected,
for the DAB-treated parasites that were then transferred into
medium containing exogenous putrescine, the intermediary
TveIF5A isoform was observed with a pI of 5.3 (Figure 1B).
These three spots were excised from the gels and digested with
trypsin to identify the protein and its possible phosphorylated
residues by MS/MS analysis. According to the MS/MS identi-
ﬁcation, all the three isoforms, with pIs of 5.5, 5.3 and 5.2,
respectively, corresponded to TveIF5A (Table S1). According
to previous reports, the pI 5.5 isoform corresponds to mature
TveIF5A, whereas the pI 5.3 and 5.2 isoforms correspond to
the intermediary and precursor TveIF5A, respectively.

Identiﬁcation of the three TveIF5A isoforms

Figure 1
Trichomonas vaginalis was grown under normal conditions (A)
or treated with DAB and then cultured in a medium containing
exogenous putrescine for 30 min (B). Total proteins were
extracted and separated on 15% polyacrylamide 2DE gel. The
gel was stained with Sypro-Ruby. Shown here are partial gels
containing small proteins (15–25 kDa) including TveIF5A iso-
forms (boxed). The pI of each TveIF5A spot is indicated at the
bottom. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate with
identical results.

The MS/MS data were analyzed to identify modiﬁcations
such as phosphorylated residues. We manually validated the
peptides to identify the phosphorylated residues. Figure 2
shows the phospho-site assignment for one of the phosphory-
lated peptides as an example. The peptide (SSAEEEVHH-
DLEIQEVDAGSQEK)
(pI 5.5)
(Figure 2A) and intermediary (pI 5.3) (Figure 2B) TveIF5A
had a monoisotopic mass of 3107.3357 and the S2 residue of
this peptide represented a phosphorylated residue (Table 1).
Peptide MSSAEEEVHHDLEIQEVDAGSQEK was identiﬁed
for the precursor TveIF5A (pI 5.2); however, no phosp hory-
lated residues were revealed (Figure 2C).

found in the mature

The phosphorylation sites were identiﬁed by manual valida-
tion of the phosphorylated peptides (Tables 1 and S2) using
Mascot analysis as described in Material and Methods section.
The mature isoform (pI 5.5) contains four phosphorylated res-
idues, S3, T55, T78 and T82, whereas the intermediary isoform
(pI 5.3) contains two phosphorylated residues at S3 and T82
(Table 1). No phosphorylated residues were observed in the
precursor TveIF5A (pI 5.2).

The position of the phosphorylated residues in the primary
sequence of TveIF5A is shown in Figure 3A. Multiple sequence
alignment analysis indicated that T55 is highly conserved in all
the species detected, while S3 and T78 are replaced with acidic
residues D or E in most of the remaining species and T82 often
is replaced with S, a residue potentially undergoing phosphor-
ylation. K57, the residue for hypusination in TveIF5A [12],
and the ﬂanking sequences are highly conserved across all spe-
cies examined (Figure S1). TveIF5A share 37% identity with
eIF5A from Leishmania mexicana. We thus generated a 3D
model of TveIF5A using eIF5A from L. mexicana (PDB:
1XTD) [13] as the template. According to the 3D model, the
phosphorylated residues T55 and T82 are near K57
(Figure 3B).

Figure 2 Phospho-site assignment and manual validation
The peptides SSAEEEVHHDLEIQEVDAGSQEK in the mature (A) and intermediary (B) TveIF5A and MSSAEEEVHHDLEIQEV-
DAGSQEK in the precursor TveIF5A (C) were obtained by Mascot analysis and subjected to manual validation for the phosphorylation
sites. The S2 in peptide SSAEEEVHHDLEIQEVDAGSQEK from the mature and intermediary TveIF5A isoforms produced a positive
signal for phosphorylation, whereas, the corresponding residue is not phosphorylated in the precursor.

Several eukaryotic translation initiation factors are re-
ported to be phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2). For
example, S2 that is highly conserved in plants and protozoan
parasites (Figure S1) is phosphorylated in most plant eIF5A

proteins that have been examined so far [14–16] . In most plant
eIF5As, the phosphorylation of S2 is performed by a protein
that belongs to the family of CK2 kinases [17]. Given the
involvement of CK2 in the phosphorylation of plant eIF5A,

Discussion

The highly conserved eukaryotic translation initiation factor
5A (eIF5A) is involved in a broad spectrum of cellular
functions. In Arabidopsis, three eIF5A isoforms have been

identiﬁed including AteIF5A1, AteIF5A2 and AteIF5A3,
which play different roles in various biological processes [14–
16]. For example, AteIF5A1 is involved in xylem formation,
whereas AteIF5A2 participates in cell division, growth and
death caused by pathogen infection and AteIF5A3 responds
to osmotic and nutrient stresses [14–16].

Three TveIF5A isoforms have been reported with the ma-
ture isoform phosphorylated [12]. Using LC–MS/MS, we dem-
onstrated in this study that the precursor TveIF5A is not
phosphorylated; the intermediate isoform is phosphorylated
at S3 and T82 and the mature isoform is phosphorylated at
S3, T55, T78 and T82. These results are in agreement with
our previous in silico analyses [12].

Despite the absence in mammalian eIF5A [18], N-terminal
S2 is highly conserved in plants and protozoan parasites exam-
ined, which could potentially be phosphorylated by CK2 [19].
In maize, S2 phosphorylation of eIF5A plays a unique role in
regulating the intracellular localization of eIF5A and the nu-
clear export of mRNAs it binds to [18]. However, no phos-

(unpublished data),

phorylation was observed at S2 in TveIF5A; instead, phos-
phorylation was detected at S3 in the mature and intermediary
TveIF5A isoforms. Our preliminary data suggest that TveI-
F5A might bind to certain mRNAs that possess eIF5A consen-
sus-binding elements
suggesting that
phosphorylation of mature TveIF5A might participate in spe-
ciﬁc regulation of this protein in T. vaginalis as well. Interest-
ingly, S3 is replaced with acidic residues D/E in most other
species. Similar replacement is also observed for T78. TveIF5A
is highly similar to its counterparts found in other protozoa,
plant and human. According to our previous phylogenetic
analyses, TveIF5A is more closely grouped with the bacterial
elongation factor P [8]. These suggest an early evolution of
TveIF5A and high conservation in the evolutionary scale.

Phosphorylated residues T55 and T82 are located near K57,
the site for hypusination in TveIF5A. In particular, the con-
served T55 is located in the same loop with K57. In higher
eukaryotes, the positively charged hypusine residue in eIF5A
facilitates its bind to exportin 4 (Exp4), enhancing the nuclear
export of eIF5A [20]. On the other hand, the negative charge in
the phosphorylated residues may prevent the interaction of
eIF5A with its nuclear receptor, causing an accumulation of
eIF5A in the nucleus [18]. Interestingly, human CK2 possesses
a nuclear localization signal [21], which might phosphorylate
and retain eIF5A in the nucleus [18]. A recent study showed
that the phosphorylated proteins might have a crucial function
in the morphological transformation of T. vaginalis from tro-
phozoite to amoeboid or pseudocyst [22]. Our preliminary
study suggests that hypusination may be involved in stabilizing
mRNA coding for these proteins (unpublished data). Until
now, it remains obscure whether there is a link between hypu-
sination and phosphorylation or whether their proximity has a
biological signiﬁcance. Further studies are needed to elucidate
the speciﬁc function of mature TveIF5A, the potential involve-
ment of phosphorylation and its association with hypusination
in the role of this protein.

CK2 is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein
kinase present in all eukaryotes [23]. Several eukaryotic trans-
lation initiation factors are reported to be phosphorylated by
CK2. For example, CK2 phosphorylates S2 in eIF2b from hu-
man [24], S318 in eIF2a, T52 and T85 in eIF2b, and S209,
T240 and S451 in eIF5 from wheat [25].

Our data also show that T. vaginalis contains an ORF cod-
ing for TvCK2. It was reported that the consensus substrate se-
quence for CK2 is S/T-x-x-E/D/pS [17]. Interestingly this
consensus sequence was found in the phosphorylated S3 resi-
due (MSSAE. . .) and in the phosphorylated T82 (..TSHE..)
in TveIF5A. CK2b is autophosphorylated [26] at S2
(MSSSEEV. . .) and S3 (MSSSEEV. . .) [17,26]. Interestingly,
TveIF5A also contains S2 and S3 (MSSAEEE. . .) in its N-ter-
minal domain, suggesting that phosphorylation at S3 of TveI-
F5A revealed by MS/MS analysis might be performed by CK2
present in T. vaginalis. Thus, TvCK2 might phosphorylate the
S3 or T82 residues of TveIF5A. However, we cannot rule out
the possibility that other kinases are involved in phosphoryla-
tion of TveIF5A, since there are 880 putative kinase genes in
T. vaginalis genome, which encode distinct protein kinases [27].
in
T. vaginalis, TveIF5A precursor is a non-phosphorylated iso-
form and mature TveIF5A is phosphorylated at S3, T55, T78
and T82, whereas the intermediate isoform, which is found un-
der polyamine depletion and upon restoration using exogenous

In conclusion, LC–MS/MS analysis indicates

that

putrescine, is phosphorylated at S3 and T82. The differential
phosphorylation proﬁles may explain the different pIs of three
TveIF5A isoforms. An endogenous CK2 that is expressed in T.
vaginalis might be involved in the phosphorylation of TveIF5A.

Materials and methods

T. vaginalis culture

The parasites were grown in Diamond’s trypticase-yeast
extract-maltose (TYM) medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated horse serum (TYM-serum) for 24 h at 37 °C
(referred to as normal medium). The polyamine metabolism
was inhibited as previously reported [12]. Brieﬂy, the parasites
were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in TYM-serum medium supple-
mented with 20 mM 1,4-diamino-2-butanone (DAB) (Sigma
Chemical, St. Louis, MO), washed with sterile phosphate-buf-
fered saline (PBS) and transferred to TYM-serum medium
supplemented with 40 mM putrescine for 30 min (Sigma) (re-
ferred to as DAB-Putrescine).

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE)

Parasites from T. vaginalis (1.8 · 108) were collected by cen-
trifugation at 900g for 5 min (4 °C), washed three times with
PBS (pH 7.0) and lysed in rehydration solution containing
7 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 70 mM DTT, 2% IPG buffer (pH
4–7) and trace bromophenol blue (Bio-Rad) as previously re-
ported [28]. For the ﬁrst dimension, 70 lg of protein was ap-
plied to an IPG strip (17 cm, pH 4–7 linear; Bio-Rad). All
isoelectric focusing took place on a Protean IEF system
(Bio-Rad). Before the second dimension, the proteins were
reduced (10 mg/ml DTT) and alkylated (25 mg/ml iodoaceta-
mide) step-wise. Equilibrated IPG strips were separated on
15% SDS–PAGE gels and were then stained using SYPROÒ
Ruby Protein Gel stain (Invitrogen) following procedures
described by the manufacturer or transferred onto nitrocellu-
lose membranes for 2DE Western blotting. Finally,
the
stained gels were documented using a Gel Doc EQ (Bio-
Rad) system. Image analysis was performed using the
PDQuest software (Bio-Rad).

Western blotting

The 2DE separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellu-
lose membranes and blocked with 0.5% skim milk in
1 · PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-Tween) for 18 h at 4 °C.
The membranes were incubated with anti- TveIF5A mouse ser-
um (1:1000 dilution) [8] for 18 h at 4 °C, washed ﬁve times with
1 · PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), incubated with a perox-
idase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution; Bio-
Rad) for 2 h at 25 °C, and developed by chemiluminescence
using an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Plus Western blot-
ting detection system (GE Healthcare) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Preimmune mouse serum (PI) was used
as a negative control (1:1000 dilution).

Finally,

the image analysis was performed using the
pDQuest software (Bio-Rad) to match the immunorecognized
spots with their corresponding protein spots in the gels. These
spots were then excised from the gels and digested with trypsin
for identiﬁcation by mass spectrometry.

Identiﬁcation of phosphorylated residues

Screening of databases and the sequence analysis of CK2 from
T. vaginalis

After staining the gels, the spots were excised and digested
using trypsin according to a previous protocol [29]. Samples
were incubated for trypsin digestion overnight (37 °C), and
100 ll of extraction buffer (1:2 (vol/vol) 5% formic acid/aceto-
nitrile) was then added to each tube. The tubes were incubated
for 15 min (37 °C) in a shaker. Samples were centrifuged at
900g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected in a tube
and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The samples were redis-
solved in 20 ll of 0.1% (vol/vol) triﬂuoroacetic acid in a tube,
puriﬁed using C18 ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore, USA) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s instruction and then injected into
the instrument as previously reported [28].

Search parameters

The default search parameters were such that a Mascot server
(Matrix Science, London, UK, available at http://www.matrix-
science.com, version 2.2; Matrixscience, London, UK) thresh-
old score of 5% indicated that the protein identiﬁcation was
likely incorrect. The Mascot Distiller v2.1 was used for peak
list generating software. All samples were searched with the
taxonomy ﬁlter ‘‘Other Eukaryota’’ (379307 sequences). The
database search parameters were set as follows: enzyme (tryp-
sin with a maximum of one missed cleavages); ﬁxed modiﬁca-
tions (carbamidomethyl (±57.021 Da at cysteine residue));
variable modiﬁcations (deamidated (±1 Da at cysteine resi-
due)) and methionine oxidation (±15.995 Da at methionine
residue) Phospho (ST), Phospho (Y); peptide mass tolerance
(±1.2 Da); fragment mass tolerance (±0.6 Da); mass toler-
ance for precursor ions (±100 ppm); and mass tolerance for
fragment ions (±0.6 Da). The protein identiﬁcation reporting
criteria included at least two MS/MS spectrum matched at the
95% level of conﬁdence (molecular weight search score ± 25)
and the presence of a consecutive b and/or c ion series of three
or more amino acids. Instrument type is ESI-QUAD-LIT.

In silico analysis

The N-terminal domains of eIF5A from different species were
aligned using the Clustal W program (http://www.ch.emb-
net.org/software/ClustalW.html) using gap penalties of 10
to minimize internal gaps. The sequences of Zea mays
(NP_001105550.1), Oryza sativa (CAC84392.1), Arabidopsis
thaliana (AEE29088.1), Toxoplasma gondii (EEB00280.1), P.
falciparum (AAM46152.1), S. cerevisiae (AAB65008.1), Schizo-
saccharomyces pombe (CAB16195.1), Homo sapiens (NP_0
01961.1), Mus musculus (CAI35154.1), Drosophila melanogaster
(NP_611878.1), Entamoeba histolytica (XP_657397.1), Leish-
mania infantum (CAB95733.1), and T. vaginalis (ADE62353.1)
were used for the alignment.

TveIF5A modelling

The Swiss-Model Workspace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/)
tool was used to model TveIF5A using L. mexicana eIF5A
(X-ray resolution: 2.70A˚ ) (PDB ID: 1XTD) as the template.
The PyMol software (DeLano Scientiﬁc LLC v0.99) was used
to highlight the phosphorylation sites in TveIF5A.

consensus

The CK2 gene sequences from several species were obtained
from the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.-gov/
Genbank/). The search for the CK2 gene in the trichDB gen-
ome database (http://www.trichdb.org/trichdb/) was per-
formed using the
sequences of CK2 from
Leishmania major, H. sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and S. cere-
visiae as query. The deduced amino acid sequence of CK2 from
T. vaginalis (TvCK2) was subsequently aligned using the Clus-
tal W program (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/Clu-
stalW.html) and used to determine the percentage of identity
and E values for the related proteins by BLAST (http://
www.expasy.org/tools/blast/). The alignment with ClustalW
used gap penalties of 10 to minimize internal gaps.

Ampliﬁcation of tvck2 from T. vaginalis

T. vaginalis isolate CNCD147 was collected by centrifugation at
900g for 5 min at 4 °C (AllegraTM X-22 Centrifuge, Beckman
Coulter). The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of TRIzolR reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA
was extracted as recommended by the manufacturer and rever-
sely transcribed using the Superscript Reverse Transcriptase
kit (Invitrogen) and the oligo-dT (dT18) (10 pmol/ll) primer.
PCR ampliﬁcation was performed using the primers (sense: 50-
GATCGGATCCATGTCGCGTGGAAGGGCGGTTCAA
AG-30; antisense: 50-CTGCACTGCAGTTATGGTTCAAT
TTTCATGTTGCGAACAGAATCG-30). (GenBank accession
number for tvck2 is KC688695).
