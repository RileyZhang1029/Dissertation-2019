Abstract The availability of a large number of sequenced bacterial genomes allows researchers not
only to derive functional and regulation information about speciﬁc organisms but also to study the
fundamental properties of the organization of a genome. Here we address an important and chal-
lenging question regarding the global arrangement of operons in a bacterial genome: why operons
in a bacterial genome are arranged in the way they are. We have previously studied this question
and found that operons of more frequently activated pathways tend to be more clustered together
in a genome. Speciﬁcally, we have developed a simple sequential distance-based pseudo energy func-
tion and found that the arrangement of operons in a bacterial genome tend to minimize the clus-
teredness function (C value) in comparison with artiﬁcially-generated alternatives, for a variety
of bacterial genomes. Here we extend our previous work, and report a number of new observations:
(a) operons of the same pathways tend to group into a few clusters rather than one; and (b) the
global arrangement of these operon clusters tend to minimize a new ‘‘energy’’ function (C+ value)
that reﬂects the efﬁciency of the transcriptional activation of the encoded pathways. These obser-
vations provide insights into further study of the genomic organization of genes in bacteria.

Up till very recently, our understanding about the global
arrangement of operons in a bacterial genome has been very

limited, mainly because of the lack of relevant data. The avail-
ability of both genomic and transcriptomic data for a large
number of bacterial organisms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genome/browse/) provides unprecedented opportunities for
researchers to derive novel and deeper understanding about
what determines the organization of the genomic information
(such as operons and associated regulatory systems) in a gen-
ome. Understanding such an issue not only satisﬁes our scien-
tiﬁc curiosity but also provides useful information that can
guide the synthesis of artiﬁcially-designed chromosomes and
organisms in the emerging ﬁeld of synthetic biology [1–3]. A
number of computational studies have been carried out aimed
at understanding the genomic organization of genes. These

relatedness

include the studies of gene expression periodicities along a bac-
terial genome [4–8], transcriptional regulation [9–11], func-
tional
[5,12,13] and co-evolution relationship
versus genomic co-locations [14]. While substantial efforts have
been invested in studying the genome organization since early
90’s [15–18], our understanding about the factors and rules
that may determine the global organization of a genome is still
fragmented.

We have previously proposed the ﬁrst model aimed to ex-
plain the organizational principle of a bacterial genome [19].
Our main ﬁnding was that the global arrangement of operons
in a bacterial genome is tightly determined by the activation
frequencies of the biological processes encoded in the genome,
including metabolic and transcriptional regulation pathways
[19,20]. This relationship can be captured to a large degree
using a simple mathematical function, based on the sequential
relationships among the relevant operons [19].

Here we extend our previous work to provide new and dee-
per understanding about the global arrangement of operons.
Speciﬁcally we developed an improved scoring function which
makes the current genomic arrangement of operons stand out
more substantially against the alternative arrangements. This
allows us to discover that operons in the same metabolic or
transcriptional regulation pathway tend to group into a few,
rather than one, sequentially nearby clusters, and the global
arrangement of these operon clusters tends to make the tran-
scriptional activation of the encoded pathways as efﬁcient as
possible.

Results

We have carried out our study on Escherichia coli K-12, which
has 4144 protein-encoding genes [21] and 2462 predicted operons
[22]. The 347 biological pathways encoded in E. coli K12 are re-
trieved from EcoCyc [23] and expression data for each gene un-
der 466 growth conditions from the M3D database [24] are used
to estimate the activation frequency of each pathway.

Operons encoding the same pathways tend to be clustered
locally, but not globally, along the genome

We have previously used the following function to measure the
global clusteredness of the component operons of the ith path-
way, ci [19],

X

Mi

dij

j¼1

ci ¼

X

N

ci

i¼1

C ¼

ð1Þ

ð2Þ

where Mi represents the number of operons in the ith pathway
and dij is the distance between the jth operon and ½Mi=2th op-
eron (i.e., median operon) in the ith pathway. Then the overall
clusteredness of the operons encoding all the pathways, C, can
be measured using the following function:

where N is the number of pathways under consideration
(N = 347 in this study). A key discovery that we made was
that the current genomic locations of all the operons in
E. coli K12 tend to minimize this function in comparison with
artiﬁcially-generated alternatives [19].

Our recent study indicates that while our initial one-cluster
model per pathway provides an informative approximation, it
is too crude. Our current analysis suggests that each pathway,
particularly the one encoded by a large number of operons,
tends to consist of a few operon clusters along the genome,
as illustrated in Figure 1 (taking the four largest pathways in
EcoCyc as examples). Based on this realization and analysis
of the M3D gene expression data, we hypothesize that all the
operons are arranged at speciﬁc genomic locations to facilitate
the most efﬁcient transcription of the operons encoding each
pathway during the life cycle of the bacteria.

We aim to use the following C+ function (to distinguish
with previous C value, C+ was used here) to assess the validity
of this hypothesis by identifying a partition of the genome into
set of genomic segments such that the function is minimized:

 

!

X
X
fi  ti þ a

M

N

xij

j¼1

Cþ ¼

i¼1

ð3Þ

where N is the number of known pathways encoded in the tar-
get genome; M is the number of partitioned segments of the
genome to be determined; fi represents the activation fre-
quency of the ith pathway estimated from the gene expression
data in M3D following the method described previously [19]
(with default value 1 for each pathway if such information is
not available); ti is the number of partitioned segments con-
taining operons of the ith pathway; sj is the number of operons
in the jth partitioned segment (j 2 ½1; M), and sij is the number
of operons of the ith pathway covered in the jth partitioned
sij ¼ 0; otherwise
segment; xij
xij ¼ ðsj   sijÞ=sj; and a is a scaling factor whose default value
is set as 1. Intuitively, this function measures the total number
of partitioned segments that encode the operons of each path-
way across all the pathways, along with a measurement of the
density of such operons among all the operons encoded in each
partitioned segment. A detailed dynamic programming proce-
dure for calculating an optimal partition of a target genome,
along with the associated M value, is given in Materials and
methods section.

is deﬁned to be 0 if

We have randomly reshufﬂed the genomic locations of
X% (X = 10, 20,. . .,100) of all the E. coli K12 operons with
the locations of the remaining operons ﬁxed, and calculated
the C+ value of each reshufﬂed genome. We reshufﬂed the
genomic locations of selected operons 100,000 times for each
X, as we did in our original study [19]. Figure 2A shows the
C+ value distribution for all the selected Xs versus the cur-
rent genome of E. coli K12. Clearly we see that the C+ value
of the current genome tends to be smaller than the C+ val-
ues of the alternatives, i.e., the artiﬁcially-generated genomes.
To compare the current scoring function with our previous
scoring function C, we did the same calculation using the
previous function C (shown in Figure 2B). We have esti-
mated the tail probability of ‘‘X < the dash line’’ (dash line
denotes the current genomic arrangement), i.e., a P-value, for
each score distribution in Figure 2, which is summarized in
Table 1.

Through the above analysis, we have demonstrated that the
current genomic arrangement of operons in the genome of
E. coli K12 tends to minimize the C+ value compared to those
of the alternative genomic arrangements of operons; and the
C+ function makes the actual genome stands out more signif-
icantly than previous C function against the alternatives. The

estimating the actual pathway activation frequency based on
M3D microarray data is presented in Figure S1 and Table S1.

Pathway-based analysis of the genomic partition

The above calculation also gives rise to an optimal partition
of the E. coli K12 genome into 104 segments, which opti-
mizes the C+ value (see details in Table S2). We have exam-
ined how the operons encoding the 347 biological pathways
are located in the 104 partitioned segments of the E. coli gen-
ome. For each of the randomly-shufﬂed genomes and the
original genome of the E. coli K12 shown in Figure 2, we re-
trieved the corresponding partitioned segments and calcu-
lated the total number of partitioned segments covered by
each pathway across all the 347 pathways under consider-
ation. From Figure 3, we can see that this total number of
the current genome of E. coli K12 is clearly smaller than
any of the randomly-reshufﬂed genomes.

In a separate study (Ma et al., unpublished data), we pro-
vided strong evidence that each of the partitioned segments

corresponds to a supercoiled domain in the folded chromo-
some of E. coli K12 [25–28], each being independently fold-
able. Clearly when a pathway needs to be activated, the
(folded) segments containing operons of the pathway need
to unfold ﬁrst to make all the relevant operons transcription-
ally accessible, a process that consumes energy. The data
shown in Figure 3 suggests that the organism has evolved
to minimize the total number of segments that need to be un-
folded in order to activate each pathway, hence making this
part of the operating cost for the living bacteria as small as
possible.

Concluding remarks

We have previously demonstrated that operons encoding more
frequently activated pathways tend to be more clustered to-
gether in a genome [19]. We have also noted that what prevents
such operons from forming one cluster is that many individual
operons may each be involved in multiple pathways. Hence
they form multi-operon clusters as we have demonstrated in
this work that they tend to form a few operon clusters each

contained in a folded genomic segment. To activate a pathway,
energy is required to unfold the genomic segments that contain
the operons encoding the pathway, so that
the relevant
operons are transcriptionally accessible. By putting all these re-
sults together, we speculate, with strong evidence, that operons
encoding various pathways are speciﬁcally located in a given
genome such there is a tendency to minimize the overall energy
needed to have the relevant pathways transcribed, during the
life cycle of the bacteria.
