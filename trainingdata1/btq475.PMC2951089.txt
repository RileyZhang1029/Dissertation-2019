ABSTRACT
Summary: The BioRuby software toolkit contains a comprehensive
set of free development tools and libraries for bioinformatics and
molecular biology, written in the Ruby programming language.
BioRuby has components for sequence analysis, pathway analysis,
protein modelling and phylogenetic analysis;
it supports many
widely used data formats and provides easy access to databases,
external programs and public web services, including BLAST, KEGG,
GenBank, MEDLINE and GO. BioRuby comes with a tutorial,
documentation and an interactive environment, which can be used
in the shell, and in the web browser.
Availability: BioRuby is free and open source software, made
available under the Ruby license. BioRuby runs on all platforms that
support Ruby, including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. And, with
JRuby, BioRuby runs on the Java Virtual Machine. The source code
is available from http://www.bioruby.org/.

1 INTRODUCTION
Research in molecular biology depends critically on access to
databases and web services. The BioRuby project was conceived in
2000 to provide easy access to bioinformatics resources through free
and open source tools and libraries for Ruby, a dynamic open source
programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity
(www.ruby-lang.org).

The BioRuby software components cover a wide range of
functionality that is comparable to that offered by other Bio*
projects, each targeting a different computer programming language
(Stajich and Lapp, 2006), such as BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002),
Biopython (Cock et al., 2009) and BioJava (Holland et al., 2008).
BioRuby software components are written in standard Ruby, so they
run on all operating systems that support Ruby itself, including
Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and Windows. With JRuby, BioRuby

also can run inside a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing
interaction with Java applications and libraries, like Cytoscape for
visualization (Shannon et al., 2003).

Both BioRuby and Ruby are used in bioinformatics for scripting
(Aerts and Law, 2009), scripting against applications (Katoh et al.,
2005), modelling (Lee and Blundell, 2009; Metlagel et al., 2007),
analysis (Prince and Marcotte, 2008), visualization and service
integration (Philippi, 2004). The web development framework
‘Ruby on Rails’ is used to create web applications and web services
(Biegert et al., 2006; Jacobsen et al., 2010). BioRuby provides
connection functionality for major web services, such as the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; see example in Fig. 1)
(Kanehisa et al., 2008), and the TogoWS service, which provides
a uniform web service front-end for the major bioinformatics
databases (Katayama et al., 2010).

The BioRuby source tree contains over 580 documented classes,
2800 public methods and 20 000 unit test assertions. Source code
is kept under Git version control, which allows anyone to clone the
source tree and start submitting. We have found that Git substantially
lowers the barrier for new people to start contributing to the project.
In the last 2 years, the source tree has gained 100 people tracking
changes and 32 people cloned the repository.

is part of

The BioRuby project

the Open Bioinformatics
Foundation, which hosts the project website and mailing list,
and organizes the annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference
together with the other Bio* projects. A number of BioRuby features
support Bio* cross-project standards, such as the BioSQL relational
model for interoperable storage of certain data objects or their
implementation is coordinated across the Bio* projects, including
support for the FASTQ (Cock et al., 2010) and phyloXML (Han and
Zmasek, 2009) data exchange formats.

2 FEATURES
BioRuby covers a wide range of functional areas which have been
logically divided into separate modules (Table 1).

BioRuby allows accessing a comprehensive range of public
bioinformatics resources. For example, BioRuby supports the Open
Biological Database Access (ODBA) as a generic and standardized
way of accessing biological data sources. In addition, BioRuby

can directly process local database ﬁles in a variety of different
ﬂat ﬁle formats, including FASTA, FASTQ (Fig. 2), GenBank
and PDB. BioRuby also allows querying and accessing remote
online resources through their interfaces for programmatic access,
such as those provided by KEGG, the DNA Databank of Japan
(DDBJ), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

BioRuby has online documentation, tutorials and code examples.
It is straightforward to get started with BioRuby and use it to replace,
or glue together, legacy shell scripts or to mix Ruby on Rails into
an existing web application.

BioRuby comes with an interactive environment, both for the
command-line shell and in the browser. Ideas can be quickly
prototyped in the interactive environment and can be saved as
‘scripts’ for later use. Such an interactive environment has shown to
be especially useful for bioinformatics training and teaching (Fig. 1).
New features, and reﬁnements of existing ones, are constantly
being added to the BioRuby code base. Current development activity
focuses on adding support for the semantic web, and on designing
a plugin system that allows adding entirely new components in a
loosely coupled manner, such that experimental new code can be
developed without having an impact on BioRuby’s core stability
and portability.

3 CONCLUSION
The BioRuby software toolkit provides a broad range of funct-
ionality for molecular biology and easy access to bioinformatics

Fig. 1. BioRuby shell example of fetching a KEGG graph using BioRuby’s KEGG API (Kanehisa et al., 2008). After installing BioRuby, the ‘bioruby’
command starts the interactive shell. With the bﬁnd command, the KEGG MODULE database is queried for entries involved in the metabolic ‘cytrate cycle’
or tricarboxylic acid cycle. The purple and blue colours, in input and output, reﬂect two modules in the carbon oxidation pathway. The user loads and conﬁrms
entries by using ﬂatparse and pathways commands. Next, KEGG ORTHOLOGY database IDs are fetched and the colours are assigned to enzymes in each
module. Finally, KEGG generates the coloured image of the ‘cytrate cycle’ pathway and the image is saved locally.

language with a focus on simplicity and productivity, which targets
all popular operating systems and the JVM. The BioRuby project
is an international and vibrant collaborative software initiative that
delivers life science programming resources for those researchers
who want to beneﬁt from the productivity features of the Ruby
language, as well as from the larger Ruby ecosystem of reusable
open source components.
