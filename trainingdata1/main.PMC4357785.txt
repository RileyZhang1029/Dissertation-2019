Abstract We aimed to shed new light on the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in liver cancer using
an integrative in silico bioinformatics analysis. A new protocol for target prediction and functional
analysis is presented and applied to the 26 highly differentially deregulated miRNAs in hepatocel-
lular carcinoma. This framework comprises: (1) the overlap of prediction results by four out of ﬁve
target prediction tools, including TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda, DIANA-microT and miRDB
(combining machine-learning, alignment, interaction energy and statistical tests in order to mini-
mize false positives), (2) evidence from previous microarray analysis on the expression of these tar-
gets, (3) gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the miRNA targets and their
pathways and (4) linking these results to oncogenesis and cancer hallmarks. This yielded new
insights into the roles of miRNAs in cancer hallmarks. Here we presented several key targets
and hundreds of new targets that are signiﬁcantly enriched in many new cancer-related hallmarks.
In addition, we also revealed some known and new oncogenic pathways for liver cancer. These
included the famous MAPK, TGFb and cell cycle pathways. New insights were also provided into
Wnt signaling, prostate cancer, axon guidance and oocyte meiosis pathways. These signaling and
developmental pathways crosstalk to regulate stem cell transformation and implicate a role of
miRNAs in hepatic stem cell deregulation and cancer development. By analyzing their complete

interactome, we proposed new categorization for some of these miRNAs as either tumor-suppres-
sors or oncomiRs with dual roles. Therefore some of these miRNAs may be addressed as therapeu-
tic targets or used as therapeutic agents. Such dual roles thus expand the view of miRNAs as active
maintainers of cellular homeostasis.

Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of short non-coding RNA
post-transcriptional regulatory molecules found in many spe-
cies, including human, which play a major role in many funda-
mentally important biological processes [1]. About 3% of
human genes encode miRNAs [2,3] and >1500 miRNA genes
have been predicted or experimentally shown to play critical
roles in normal cellular functions [4], which are often found
in fragile sites on chromosomes [5]. The expression of miRNAs
is highly speciﬁc for the tissue and the developmental stage
[6,7]. Several miRNA proﬁle signatures are being advanced
as markers of different cancers [8,9]. They are involved in
numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle, proliferation,
apoptosis and response to stress [10]. Although miRNA regu-
lation mainly utilizes the RNA interference pathway to
suppress the expression of protein-encoding genes at posttran-
scriptional level [11], other modes of action are emerging [12].
Principles of miRNA target binding show that miRNA has key
targets that it binds to in almost complete complementarity at
the target sites (the 30UTR of mature mRNAs), leading to their
degradation (canonical binding). In addition, for most targets,
50 dominant
seed region or
incomplete complementarity to 50 and 30 (30UTR compensa-
tory) occurs, resulting in translational suppression [11,12].
Biogenesis and transcription of miRNAs have been thoroughly
reviewed [13] and more insights into miRNA transcription
regulation are ongoing. miRNAs can work both as tumor
tumor
suppressors

complementarity to the

and as oncogenes

[8,9,14,15]. As

(Figure 1)

suppressors, they repress oncogenic targets, but are usu-
ally down-regulated in cancer tissues [15]. Others are up-regu-
lated and have a stimulating role for cancer progression
[14,16]. These miRNAs can up regulate multiple cancer
hallmarks [17]
through induction of different
pathways and biological processes (adhesion, proliferation,
transcription, translation and inﬂammation), hence, several
cancer hallmarks that contribute to cancer initiation and devel-
opment are affected [17]. This dual role as oncomiRs and
tumor suppressors has stimulated multiple studies on miRNAs
and cancers [8,10], prompting full identiﬁcations of miRNA
target genes [18].

The difﬁculty of miRNA target prediction and biological
validation has been a major obstacle to miRNA research.
Experimental identiﬁcation of miRNA targets is still slow,
since some miRNAs are difﬁcult to isolate by cloning due to
low expression, low stability, tissue speciﬁcity and problems
in cloning procedures. Computational algorithms have been
developed to identify miRNA target genes, since the 30UTRs
of transcripts were shown to contain miRNA binding sites
[19] (Figure 2). To develop such algorithms, principles of miR-
NA target recognition are often established based on empirical
evidence. A lot of features are used by mammalian target pre-
diction programs. These include base pairing pattern, thermo-
dynamic
the miRNA–mRNA duplex [20],
comparative sequence analysis of target sites in different
species, multiple target site evaluation, site accessibility and
UTR context [20–22]. The well known miRanda program
employs a two-step algorithm: in the ﬁrst step, an alignment
algorithm is used to align the seed region of the miRNA to

stability of

the 30UTRs of the target mRNAs and in the second step, cross-
species conservation and target accessibility are used for
conﬁrming the target, in addition to the several other afore-
mentioned factors [22,23]. More recently, several new algo-
rithms
using machine-learning
approaches like support vector machine (SVM), artiﬁcial
neural network (ANN) such as the MTar tool
[24] and
Bayesian classiﬁers [25], trained on known miRNA target
datasets. Some recent tools also combined other features like
negative examples for improving the speciﬁcity and sensitiv-
ity. Still, the sensitivity and particularly the speciﬁcity of tar-
get prediction can be
improved [26,27]. The use of
combinations of target prediction tools as recently presented
by the miRWalk and the mirror servers address some of
these issues [28,29]. However, the mirror server analyzes
combinations of miRNAs, not
and
miRWalk only ﬁnds targets based on its algorithm, and then
ﬁnd the scores of those combinations using other tools. This
motivated us to employ an improved approach for target
prediction based on consensus of
tools and multiple
statistical steps.

individual ones,

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide health
problem with tools for early diagnosis and novel therapies ur-
gently needed. Prognosis and survival rates can be improved
signiﬁcantly in cases of early diagnosis. Hence, the need arises
for ﬁnding early biomarkers and drug targets as well as novel
therapeutic intervention strategies [30]. Several studies indi-
cated that some miRNAs were differentially expressed in liver
disease and could be potential biomarkers [31–37]. Interest-
ingly, different miRNAs and molecular mechanisms were
unravelled for HCV-induced and HBV-induced HCC [31]. In
addition, pathways related to apoptosis, DNA damage, recom-
bination and signal transduction were activated in HBV,
whereas those related to antigen presentation, lipid metabo-
lism, cell cycle, proteasome and immune response were acti-
vated in HCV [31].

Furthermore, there has been a controversy in the literature
about the roles of miRNAs in different cancers. Most reports
point to miRNA deregulation being associated with the genesis
and development of cancers [14,38,39]. Other studies reported
miRNAs as contributing to cellular immune responses to
pathogens and cancers [40–46].

The large number of high throughput data generated and
the different expression proﬁling studies in liver cancer has
triggered this investigation of a holistic look on the functional
roles of miRNAs in liver cancer [31–37,47]. Here, we aim to
investigate the functional roles of deregulated miRNAs during
initiation and development of HCC by performing a uniﬁed
meta-analysis. To our knowledge, this integrative in silico bio-
informatics analysis has not been previously performed. An
improved protocol for miRNA target prediction with multiple
steps of statistical validation was introduced to help minimize
false positives. The analysis steps included identiﬁcation of key
miRNAs deregulated in HCC from different reports in the lit-
erature [16,31–37,47], followed by identiﬁcation of their target
genes using an integrated in silico approach. Identiﬁcation of
the key enriched pathways and gene ontology annotations
which affected cancer hallmarks were then conducted. Finally,
at Step 4 of the framework, we attempted to classify the impor-
tant miRNAs as tumor suppressors or oncomiRs.

This analysis unravelled the participation of miRNAs in
regulation of key oncogenic and new pathways affecting liver
cancer, such as the MAPK, TGFb, Wnt, cell cycle and oocyte
meiosis pathways that drive tumorigenic transformations of
somatic and stem cells. Also, different roles for the miRNAs
examined have been revealed, many of which have been previ-
ously validated by experimental studies, thus providing
support to our ﬁndings. For example, a new role for HCV-in-
duced, HCC-upregulated miR-96 has been inferred in sup-
pressing expression of
some important oncogenes. This
analysis also led us to infer that some miRNAs are up-regu-
lated target oncogenes (upregulate tumor suppressor miRNAs)

and thus contribute to ‘‘ﬁghting’’ cancer progression, while
‘‘mixed-effect miRNAs’’ were found that have both tumor
suppressors and oncogenes as targets, thus playing a dual role.
The novel protocol for comprehensive meta-analysis proposed
in this study could be extended to other cancers.

Results

The miRNAs with highly differential expression in cancerous
versus non-cancerous tissue were identiﬁed from published
miRNA proﬁling studies [17,31–39,47] as well as in the Pheno-
miR database (www.mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenomir/
). These miRNAs, their expression levels and their predicted
and validated target genes are listed in Table S1. There are
17 miRNAs with high expression in HCC (including miR-18,
miR-224, miR-21, miR-182, miR-183, miR-222, miR-96,
miR-9, miR-216, miR-155, miR-301, miR-221, miR-324-5p,
miR-186, miR-151, miR-106b and miR-374). Additionally,
there are 9 miRNAs with low expression in HCC (miR-199a-
3p, miR-125a, miR-195, miR-199a-5p, miR-200a, miR-122a,
miR-139 miR-214 and miR-34a).

Improved prediction of miRNA targets

To ﬁnd miRNA target genes with a good compromise between
sensitivity and speciﬁcity, several steps were included to mini-

mize false positives and false negatives (Figure 2). (A) First we
identify the overlap, which is the consensus among four out of
ﬁve different algorithms; (B) identifying seed-region full com-
plementarity and low hybridization energies and (C) statistical
analysis through a process of shufﬂing the miRNAs was per-
formed for target validation (P < 0.005 for all targets); and
(D) ﬁnally, expression of miRNAs and their targets was anti-
correlated using liver cancer microarray studies [48]. Such
expression anti-correlation provides another layer of evidence,
suggesting that they are real miRNA targets.

The miRNA targets commonly picked up by 4 out of 5 dif-
ferent programs (TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda, DIANA-mi-
croT and miRDB) (Figure 2 and methods for details) were
identiﬁed with a Perl script (Table S1). These were then com-
pared to the experimentally-validated targets according to
miRTarBase and miRecord to identify novel targets. The
important miRNA target sets that contribute to the hallmarks
of cancer are presented in Figure 1. Further improvements to
reduce false positives were achieved by making use of informa-
tion from a previous gene expression analysis study in HCC
[48]. The target genes that showed expression inversely-corre-
lated with that of miRNAs were collected from the liver micro-
array dataset available as a supplementary ﬁle [48] and are
indicated by an asterisk (*) in Table S1. Moreover, RNAhy-
brid was used to calculate the minimum free energy (MFE)
of the duplex miRNA:mRNA [49]. RNAhybrid was optimized

Shown are the examples for hybridization between miRNAs and their respective target genes for miR-195 and FGF-7 (A), miR-195 and

CELSR1 (G), miR-224 and NUP153 (H), indicating different modes of target recognition exhibited by miRNAs (canonical for some key
targets that would undergo degradation similar to siRNA mode of action, while 50 dominant and 30UTR compensatory for targets that
would undergo translational suppression). All these examples show the fertility of our approach of uniﬁed target prediction, as all targets
have MFE <  20 kcal/mol (I). Green represents miRNA and red represents the target sequence. MFE stands for minimum free energy.

to show the hybridization at the 30UTR of the target genes.
The common targets were thus conﬁrmed according to low
MFE values. Examples of the miRNA-gene interactions are
illustrated in Figure 3. Some of miRNAs can bind at different
sites within the 30UTR of the target gene at different MFEs
and different modes of binding as illustrated in the description
of Figure 3. The key targets of miRNA would have canonical
matching and these miRNAs employ the similar mode of gene
silencing as siRNAs through mRNA cleavage and degradation
[11,12]. Statistical shufﬂing to determine the signiﬁcance of the
target prediction approach was then performed, which was sig-
niﬁcant (P < 0.005) for all the predicted targets. The extre-
mely low P values (<60.05) indicate that these targets are
likely to represent true targets. These results highlight the high
speciﬁcity and richness of our approach in using consensus
predictions for targets and combining microarray validation,
whenever possible, and free energy hybridization/target acces-
sibility. This detailed analysis enabled us to deﬁne different
modes of binding for some of the targets and hence their pro-
spective regulation modes (mRNA cleavage versus transla-
tional suppression). The recent miRWalk and mirror servers
were also used [26,27], providing a platform for target predic-
tion using the miRWalk algorithm to check the prediction
results across different tools and mirror to provide a combina-
torial view of targets of these set of miRNAs.

tools

Some examples of target genes with high prediction scores
using most
include CPEB4, PLAG1, TP53INP2,
PRKCE, BCL2, CUGBP22, FOXQ1, PEX5, PEX13, FGF7,
ETS1, E2F5, RASA1 and ARHGEF12 (see Table S1 for the
full names and miRNAs targeting these genes). In Table 1
we listed some important predicted transcription factors
(TFs) and regulators of growth factors and their regulatory
genes that have been targeted by some miRNAs examined in
this study due to their important link to cancer and potential
as drug targets/tumor suppressors.

Enrichment analysis of gene ontology annotations and pathways

testing [50]. Most of the gene ontology (GO) annotations were
associated with regulation of cell cycle, transcription, cell
adhesion, cell signaling, apoptosis and proliferation pathways
(Figures 4 and 5, S1–S3 and Tables 2–4). Therefore, a strong
link exists between these target pathways and the hallmarks
of cancer [51,52] and how the miRNAs can affect carcinogen-
esis of the liver [48,50–53]. Enriched pathways were evaluated
using the gene set enrichment analysis of GeneTrail. These en-
riched pathways that are targeted by these miRNAs and af-
fected genes and signiﬁcance
level are summarized in
Table 2. Some important genes and miRNAs appear in more
than one pathway, highlighting potential cross talks between
these pathways. The predicted targets covered almost all the
cancer hallmarks. The DAVID bioinformatics tool was used
to calculate the P value of the most signiﬁcant GO annotations
with FDR correction. This was done for the target set of the
ﬁrst seven miRNAs in Table S1 as shown in Figure 4. In Fig-
ure 5, the enriched GO annotations and pathways of the target
set of the 22 miRNAs using GenTrail are presented as well as
in Tables 2–4. The results of GeneTrail analysis showed a sig-
niﬁcant P-value for some important GO annotations and path-
ways. It was interesting that
these GO annotations and
pathways were highly linked to oncogenesis, transcription,
growth control and growth factors that affect the cell during
oncogenesis and the cell cycle (Figures 4 and 5).

The pathways that showed signiﬁcant enrichment for the
miRNA target set from Table S1 using the miRNA target
genes were of two categories: active pathways and inactive
pathways. Active pathways include MAPK signaling pathway
(P = 0.0030), TGFb signaling pathway (P = 0.0030), regula-
tion of the actin cytoskeleton pathway (P = 0.0173), prostate
cancer
pathway
(P = 0.0247), axon guidance pathway, which controls regula-
tion of actin cytoskeleton (P = 0.0117), Wnt signaling path-
way (P = 0.0053) and oocyte meiosis pathway (P = 0.0053).
On the other hand, there is only one pathway in the category

Finally, statistical functional enrichment analysis was per-

ment of many GO annotations of the 26 miRNAs provides a
clear picture for having a deﬁnitive impact on all HCC/other

Important pathways in HCC

Figure 6
Shown is the mTOR/AKP/PIP3 pathway that contributes to transformation of nodules into metastatic counterparts [57]. The target genes
are indicated in green and key pathway phenotypes are shown at the bottom. Deactivation of the MAPK pathway through inhibition/
repression of the up-regulating miRNAs or activation of suppressing miRNAs might be useful as an alternative therapeutic intervention
strategy. Genes are indicated in pink ovals; FGF signaling pathway, actin cytoskeleton pathway and mTOR pathway are represented with
lines in black, red and green, respectively.

cancer hallmarks (Figures 4–6). Whether these effects are posi-
tive or negative depends on the speciﬁc miRNA(s) and their
speciﬁc targets. This important impact of miRNAs in cancer
has opened new therapeutic modalities for liver cancer by sup-
pression or induction of these miRNAs [40–44].

Discussion

This study reports an improved protocol for prediction and
analysis of novel miRNA targets that have been shown to be
deregulated in liver cancer. It also sheds more light on their
functional roles in relative to oncogenesis. Our study identiﬁed
several targets related to oncogenesis and metastasis. Some of
the predicted miRNA targets in this study have already been
experimentally validated (according to databases of experi-
mentally veriﬁed targets such as miRecord and miRTarBase).

The improved miRNA target prediction protocol

In this study, functional role of miRNA targets in liver cancer
was evaluated and a comprehensive analysis of deregulated
miRNAs in HCC was performed, yielding novel insight into
carcinogenesis and metastasis. Below we discuss some of the
important novel targets, according to pathway analysis and
GO functional category enrichment analysis. The presence of
tens of already experimentally-validated targets, after inspec-
tion of the experimentally-validated target databases, was the

ﬁnal step to conﬁrm the reliability of this approach. The set
of overlapping targets (core or common targets) would have
a high speciﬁcity (low false positives), while the set of pooled
targets predicted with different programs would have a high
sensitivity, but high false positives. We used the core common
targets to analyze these deregulated miRNAs in order to get a
reliable analysis from the functional enrichment analysis. In
discussing some of the key targets in the pathways below; we
refer to the validated ones from miRecords and miRTarBase
with [V] and predicted ones with [P]. A quantitative evaluation
and comparison of the performance of our integrated ap-
proach is beyond the scope of this manuscript, and faces the
challenge of correlating heterogeneous microarray studies to
ﬁnd a substantial inverse correlation between a miRNA and
its targets. On a qualitative note, our core set is much smaller
than that presented by a single tool (Figure 2, target prediction
step), and has a high statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.01). More
detailed comparisons of methods are aimed in the future. We
then performed the pathway analysis and GO functional cate-
gory enrichment analysis, trying to understand how deregula-
tion of
important cellular and
molecular processes,
induce/repress critical pathways, and
hence contributing to carcinogenesis and metastasis.

before. Also, unlike previous reports which only present
enrichment analysis [35,50], an in-depth analysis is presented
and discussed concerning the roles of the miRNAs and the
contribution of their deregulation to cancer progression along
with their roles in cancer hallmarks. Also, the mode of regula-
tion of the different miRNAs whether to suppress or induce
the pathway or the hallmark is inferred. These unravel signif-
icant new and valuable information on the different pathways
affected by the set of highly differentially regulated miRNAs in
liver cancer, and key genes that are affected in each of the en-
riched pathways. Some previous reports on the roles of miR-
NAs in liver cancer rely only on experimentally validated
targets, thus limiting their scope of coverage [31,34,35,55]. In
addition, some studies based their views on the role of a certain
miRNA on only one validated target, which gives a very nar-
row and inaccurate perspective. Some exceptions in the litera-
ture include the recent work on global miRNA analysis in
breast cancer [56]. This study found previously mentioned
pathways linked to miRNA deregulation and liver cancer, such
as the MAPK, TGFb and cell cycle pathways, discussed in
studies and reviews such as [10,34,35,50]. Meanwhile, the
GeneTrail analysis showed up regulation of the Wnt signaling
and the oocyte meiosis pathways (Table 2), in addition to axon
guidance and actin cytoskeleton which are involved in develop-
mental processes and in stem cell differentiation and prolifera-
tion, highlighting a possible link between miRNAs and errors
in stem cell differentiation and their transformation into can-
cer stem cells [43,46,57]. The role of miRNAs in inducing can-
cer stem cells was previously noted for some well known tumor
suppressor miRNAs like miR-34a and others in different tu-
mors [16,44,46]. The link between miRNAs and stem cells
was in agreement with previous reports highlighting miRNA
roles in stem cell differentiation and liver cancer [44,57]. Also
worth noting is emergence of the enriched prostate cancer path-
way as an enriched pathway, signifying the important impact of
miRNAs in cancer and offering possible general uniﬁed roles for
these miRNAs in closely-related tumors like solid tumors.

The MAPK and mTOR signaling and cancer hallmarks

Interestingly, the MAPK signaling pathway was one of the en-
riched pathways with the highest statistical signiﬁcance (with
part of it and the candidate targets highlighted red in Figure S1
and some others shown in Table 2 and Figure 6 linked to cros-
stalks to other important pathways in cancer that are affected
by the miRNA targets). Dual mode of regulation of target
genes by miRNAs was noticed. For example, gene encoding
ﬁbroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) is targeted by two miRNAs:
miR-155 [V], which is validated in miRTarBase and miRWalk
with up-regulated expression in HCC, and miR-195 [P] with
down-regulated expression in HCC. FGF7 induces the MAPK
pathway by binding to extracellular receptors [58]. FGF7 is in-
ferred from its GO annotation to be involved in self-sufﬁciency
in growth signals and limitless replicative potential, in addition
to evading apoptosis and tissue invasion and metastasis [40]
(Figures 1 and 6). Besides, FGF7 is also a key regulator of
the actin cytoskeleton pathway (shown in pathway targets in
Table 2). Furthermore, up regulation of FGF7 expression con-
tributes to the FGF receptor signaling pathway [59] and posi-
tively regulates cell division, proliferation and keratinocyte
migration pathways, which were also signiﬁcantly enriched in

the GO analysis (Figures 4 and 6 for part of the FGF path-
way). Sufﬁciency in growth signals is revealed by signiﬁcantly
enriched GO terms such as growth and positive regulation of
transcription (Figures 3 and 4). Another important key gene,
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1) (Fig-
ure S1), is a target for miR-96 [P], which is up regulated in
HCC. MAP2K1 is the upstream activator of MAPK, thus
occupying a central role in the MAPK pathway. Given its high
selectivity to MAPK and elevated levels of constitutively acti-
vated MAP2K1 is frequently-observed in carcinoma cell lines
[60], MAP2K1 represents an excellent target for pharmacolog-
ical intervention.

Similarly, suppression of the MAPK signaling pathway
could be inferred by miR-34 [V]. miR-34 suppresses platelet-
derived growth factor A (PDGFRA) [V] (validated in miRTar-
Base) and other oncogenes that have been validated previously
such as c-Met, NOTCH and Wnt1 [41]. Although of its pre-
dominant down expression in many cancer cell lines, the mixed
levels of miR-34a in different liver cancer cell lines reported by
different investigators may reﬂect the opposing mechanisms
that affect its expression (activated by P53 and inactivated
by methylation and many other factors) and contribute to
enhancement or decrease of its tumor suppressor role in
ﬁghting cancer. Expression of miR-34a is activated by p53 pro-
tein, thus resulting in a high tumor-suppressing mode [61].
Also, miR-34 contributes to decreasing proliferation by target-
ing CCNE2 Cyclin E2 [V] (validated in miRTarBase and
miRWalk), which may allow proliferation when miR-34 is
down regulated. From our analysis and previous reports,
hsa-miR-34 also targets PDGFRA and E2F5, all of which in-
duce proliferation and replication [41]. Interestingly, miR-34,
which is currently introduced as a replacement therapy for
different cancers in the clinic, plays a clearly-deﬁned role in
stem cell regulation through regulating the Wnt signaling
pathway [41].

In agreement with this, growth hormone receptor (GHR) is
another predicted target for down-regulated miR-195 [P] in
cancer tissue (Figures 6 and S1). miR-195 contributes to
evading apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, cell growth, tissue
invasion and metastasis. This miRNA is an important
tumor-suppressor [45]. Insensitivity to anti-growth signals, an-
other important cancer hallmark, is illustrated by suppression
of a tumor suppressor of MAPK signaling, the SPRY4 gene
[62]. SPRY4 is predicted to be a target for miR-182 [P], which
is highly expressed in HCC. As a result, SPRY4 expression is
down-regulated in HCC. Additionally, RAS p21 protein acti-
vator 1 (RASA1), a target of up-regulated miR-182 [V] [63],
stimulates the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not
its oncogenic counterpart, hence, acting as a suppressor of
RAS and thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation
and differentiation. Due to its down regulation, the active
form of RAS is stimulated, which functions as an oncogene.
These data support the inference of an oncomiR role for
miR-182. Also, expression of receptor-type tyrosine-protein
phosphatase F (PTPRF) that is involved in the negative regu-
lation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
pathway [64] would be up regulated, since it is a target for
down-regulated miR-199a-3p [V] [65], leading to insensitivity
to anti-growth signals. CACNB4 is one of the important genes
in the MAPK pathway (controlled by miR-96 [V], which is
highly expressed in HCC), hence, helping in controlling the
MAPK signaling pathway.

The TGFb pathway

The TGFb was the second most highly enriched pathway (Fig-
ure S3). Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor II
(BMPRII), through which the BMP ligand transduces its sig-
nals in the TGFb pathway, was predicted as a target for
miR-106b over-expressed in HCC. Upon ligand binding,
BMPRII phosphorylates and activates BMPRI, which then
initiates downstream signaling by phosphorylating the recep-
tor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) [57]. Smad7, a negative regula-
tor of TGFb signaling, is targeted by miR-106b [V] [36] and
miR-21 [V] [66] highly-expressed in HCC, resulting in down
regulation of Smad7.

Cell cycle pathway

The E2F family plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle
and regulation of tumor suppressor proteins. E2F5, a regula-
tor of the TGFb and cell cycle pathways [67], was targeted
by miR-96 [P], miR- 34a [V] (validated in miRTarBase) and
miR-106 [P]. Down regulation of E2F5 through this combina-
torial mechanism by miR-96 and miR-106 inhibits the synthe-
sis of DNA, thus repressing the S phase. On the other hand,
E2F5 is involved in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting c-Myc,
an oncogene and a transcription factor that is believed to reg-
ulate expression of 15% of all genes [68]. Thus a reduced level
of E2F5 would lead to compromised control over c-myc. These
data suggest that involvement of different miRNAs with
opposing roles for E2F5 which itself has dual roles could result
in different outcomes.

Other new pathways linked to stem cells and their regulation
that are signiﬁcantly enriched in our analysis

Two additional pathways that were enriched for the miRNA
target set genes include regulation of actin cytoskeleton and
axon guidance. Cancer cells are marked by their ability to mi-
grate and invade the adjacent tissues. Interestingly, several
studies have shown that proteins linking migratory signals to
actin cytoskeleton are up regulated in cancer tissues [69,70].
For example, ﬁbronectin 1 (FN1) plays an important role in
the actin cytoskeleton pathway because it activates the integrin
(ITG) gene. ITG in turn activates a series of other genes, lead-
ing to the formation of actin ﬁbers and polymerization [71,72],
which connects the cells to each other. Therefore, the axon
guidance pathway is involved in regulation of the actin cyto-
skeleton and represents a key factor in the formation of the
neuronal network (Figures 6 and S2). Both pathways are in-
ferred to be linked with tissue invasion and metastasis cancer
hallmark.

The oocyte meiosis pathway is another enriched pathway
for our gene set (part of which is shown in Figure S3). This
pathway is highly important during the differentiation of stem
cells [73]. MAP2K1 that was described in the aforementioned
MAPK pathway is one of the most important genes in this
pathway and contributes to control of stem cells and their
oncogenic transformation.

Some other interesting targets in this pathway include aden-
ylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) and ADCY6, which are targets for
miR-182. ADCY6 has been experimentally veriﬁed previously
while ADCY2 is reported in this work for the ﬁrst time.

ADCY2 is involved in the chemokine signaling pathway and
is one of the key genes in the oocyte meiosis pathway. Once it
is activated through progesterone induction, it activates a series
of gene cascades leading to completion of the meiosis process.

Conclusion

Some important conclusions that could be drawn from this
study on some of the general features of miRNAs roles in liver
cancer are as follows. (1) The miRNA targets, as revealed from
their enriched GO annotations and pathways, cover many of
the known hallmarks of cancer [51,52,54]. Expression of many
growth and transcription factors is up regulated due to the
down regulation of their regulating miRNAs. (2) Positive con-
tribution to cancer development is implicated for many down-
regulated miRNAs that suppress important oncogenes, such as
miR-122, miR-214, miR-199a-3p/5p and miR-34a, and for sev-
eral up-regulated miRNAs that suppress tumor-suppressors,
such as miR-182 and miR-186 oncomiRs. Some miRNAs
may play dual roles by targeting both tumor-suppressors and
oncogenes. Therefore, without complete analysis of their tar-
gets and pathways (interactome), caution should be taken in
deﬁning the role of deregulated miRNAs in liver cancer, as
well as in using miRNAs in cancer therapeutics. (3) Some miR-
NAs down regulate cancer hallmarks by downregulating some
oncogenic pathways, which was also inferred by other studies
[74]. Although there is an ongoing debate on what are cancer
hall marks and the complex interplay between causes, onco-
genic events, signal transduction programs and hallmarks
[54,75], it is clear that miRNA deregulation can have dual
roles. (4) miR-96 was inferred in this study to play a tumor
suppressor role by targeting MAP2K1, E2F5 and CACNB4.
miR-96 was reported to suppress oncogenes such as glypi-
can-3 (GPC3) [76], although an oncomiR role was inferred
as well. Silencing of miR96 was associated with decreased
expression of osteopontin and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)
and FOXO3a and hence decreased invasion and metastasis
and proliferation, respectively [77,78]. Some targets were
found to be controlled by more than one miRNA. Also, some
TFs like TP63 gamma coordinate with miRNAs for regulation
of some targets, supporting the miRNA-TF regulatory net-
work analysis [79]. (5) Targets of miR-96, miR-106b, miR-
34a and miR-155 were most often highly represented in the
most enriched oncogenic pathways, suggesting their involve-
ment in liver cancer.

Materials and methods

The miRNA data were downloaded from miRBase release 19
(http://www.mirbase.org/). The steps of this comprehensive
global analysis of differentially-regulated miRNAs in liver can-
cer are detailed below and also illustrated in Figure 2. This
workﬂow is similar to the integrative automated siRNA design
and selection protocol and tool that we previously devised [80].

Protocol for miRNA target prediction

miRNA prediction was done using ﬁve different programs in
the present study to ensure high speciﬁcity in target prediction.
The programs that were used include TargetScan 5.1 [81],

ElHefnawi M et al / Wholistic Analysis of MicroRNAs in Liver Cancer

365

PicTar [82], DIANA-microT v3.0 [83], miRDB [84] and miR-
anda [23]. Targets that were commonly predicted by 4 or 5
out of 5 programs were retained. The programs were chosen
to represent different approaches for miRNA target predic-
tion. The miRanda prediction software identiﬁed potential
binding sites by looking for high-complementarity regions on
the 30UTRs, which is called seed region [23]. Then the resulting
binding sites are evaluated thermodynamically using the Vien-
na RNA folding package. The second program TargetScan 5.1
[81] combines thermodynamics-based modeling of RNA–RNA
duplex interactions with comparative sequence analysis to pre-
dict miRNA targets conserved across multiple mammalian
genomes. TargetScan mainly depends on perfect complemen-
tarity to the seed region of miRNA and then extends to com-
plementarity outside the region. PicTar also depends on the
seed region complementarity and its most distinguishing fea-
ture is its probabilistic identiﬁcation of combinations of target
sites [82]. DIANA-microT 3.0 [83] searches in the UTRs for
stringent seed paring (at least 7 consecutive Watson–Crick
pairs) to the miRNA. The last algorithm miRDB uses a newly
developed SVM classiﬁer [84].

Identiﬁcation of experimentally-validated targets and
differentially-expressed predicted targets in HCC

Next, the targets were compared against already predicted and
validated targets known in databases such as the database of
experimentally-validated targets in miRTarBase (http://mirtar-
base.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) and miRecord (http://mirecords.bio-
lead.org/) [79].

Statistical enrichment analysis of the predicted target set

for

the database

Statistically overrepresented functions were revealed in a sam-
ple of seven miRNA targets as a ﬁrst indication of essential en-
riched terms by using
annotation,
visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) (http://davi-
d.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp). This was combined with a
more comprehensive analysis, enrichment analysis of the pre-
dicted target set, using the GeneTrail tool [86] (http://gene-
trail.bioinf.uni-sb.de/) with FDR and Bonferroni corrections
for multiple items in the set. The list of predicted genes was
compared against a random list of genes to predict which func-
tions and pathways are enriched in the target genes and signif-
icance level
[50]. GeneTrail was used again to obtain the
functions of different miRNA target sets and their combina-
tions for identifying their possible roles in cancer.

Acknowledgements

The microarray dataset showing differentially-expressed genes
in hepatocellular carcinoma patients [48] was used to correlate
the predicted targets and those differentially-expressed in HCC
patients. The two-sample t-test was used for correlation anal-
ysis. This was yet another step to improve the reliability of
the predictions of the miRNA targets.

Ranking according to MFE

Ranking of miRNA targets was done using the RNAhybrid
program according to MFE, (DG) [36,81]. Some important
examples are illustrated in Figure 3.

Shufﬂing and statistical analysis of the targets

Statistical analysis of the targets was performed to support the
validity of the prediction. We used Jemboss (graphical user
interface for European Molecular Biology Open Software
Suite) Shufﬂe Seq program [85], in which the target’s sequences
were shufﬂed 500 times as previously described [17]. The 100
sets for each of the target genes were independently searched
against its reported predicted miRNA using miRanda soft-
ware. Z scores were calculated for each target using the equa-
tion Z ¼ X l
(where X is the miRanda score for real gene, l
and d are the mean and standard deviation for miRanda score
of each miRNA with shufﬂe gene). Then, P values were calcu-
lated to estimate the signiﬁcance of the predicted targets.
