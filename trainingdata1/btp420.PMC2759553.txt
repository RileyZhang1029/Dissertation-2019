ABSTRACT
Summary: SIMBioMS is a web-based open source software system
for managing data and information in biomedical studies. It provides
a solution for the collection, storage, management and retrieval of
information about research subjects and biomedical samples, as
well as experimental data obtained using a range of high-throughput
technologies, including gene expression, genotyping, proteomics
and metabonomics. The system can easily be customized and has
proven to be successful in several large-scale multi-site collaborative
projects. It is compatible with emerging functional genomics data
standards and provides data import and export in accepted standard
formats. Protocols for transferring data to durable archives at the
European Bioinformatics Institute have been implemented.
Availability: The source code, documentation and initialization
scripts are available at http://simbioms.org.

1 INTRODUCTION
The growing use of high-throughput technologies in biomedical
studies and the volume and complexity of data generated in
such experiments have created a need for dedicated software
systems to collect, store and manage these data. Moreover, essential
information about biomedical research subjects (patients) and
samples have to be recorded and linked to the data. Projects are often
collaborative, include many researchers and laboratories and may be
spread across different sites. Personal information must be managed
in a secure manner, the data access rights should be consistent with
ethical requirements. Generic laboratory information management
systems are not always appropriate for these purposes. The existing
open source software systems (e.g. Reich et al., 2006; Saal et al.,

2002; Saeed et al., 2003) have been primarily designed for use in a
single laboratory.

To address these issues, we have developed a web-based System
for Information Management in BioMedical Studies—SIMBioMS.
It was originally implemented for needs of a particular multi-site
project (MolPAGE, www.molpage.org). Since later it proved to be
easily customizable and scalable for other applications, including
population genomics studies, we generalized the system as open
source software.

SIMBioMS provides an interface for data entry via web
forms, upload facilities of pre-formatted datasets from ﬁles, data
export facilities (including conﬁgurable export deﬁnable by XML
templates) as well as advanced data access and user
rights
management. The system can be conﬁgured to support the minimum
information requirements MIBBI (Taylor et al., 2008), data can
be imported/exported in accepted standard formats MAGE-TAB
(Rayner et al., 2006) and ISA-TAB (Sansone et al., 2008), as well
as custom-made XML and tab-delimited formats, allowing for easy
data import and export from users’ own tools, and generic tools such
as Excel. A simple browsing and customizable data ﬁltering options
allow for the essential content exploration and report construction
on metadata level. Selected data can be imported into analysis tools,
such as Bioconductor.

2 SYSTEMS DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND

CUSTAMIZATION

The system consists of two components—Sample Information
Management System (SIMS) and Assay data and Information
Management System (AIMS) (Fig. 1). As the names suggest, SIMS
is designed to collect phenotypical, environmental and technical
information about samples, while AIMS handles the experimental
data from high-throughput assays. SIMS provides a simple solution
for data anonymization by creating identiﬁers linked to person’s

information in a separate module. SIMS extends a previously
published system (PASSIM; Viksna et al., 2007). The main new
features include customizability and compatibility with data formats
MAGE-TAB and ISA-TAB. While, PASSIM was designed to
manage patient and sample data, it did not have any means for
linking it to data from high-throughput assays.

AIMS is a new system ﬁlling this gap, designed for adoptability
for any technological platform, and for easy extraction of captured
data for analysis. It is linked to SIMS through a three-level hierarchy:
a person can be linked to one or more samples, a sample can have
one or more aliquots. Each aliquot can have one or more assays
performed on it, and each assay can be linked to one or more
data ﬁles. Assays are grouped in experiments and studies, each of
which can have one or more data ﬁles attached. For instance, raw
microarray data ﬁles would be normally linked to individual assays,
while normalized gene expression matrices to experiments. Assays
are technology-speciﬁc; the current AIMS conﬁgurations include
genotyping, sequencing, proteomics and metabonomics.

The two systems can be installed and used independently, or
jointly—if a laboratory already has a local informatics system for
sample or assay data, it can be used jointly with AIMS or SIMS,
respectively.

SIMBioMS run in Apache Tomcat servlet containers, or other
application servers. The data are stored in PostgreSQL databases,
but other popular database management systems have been tested
and can be used with minimal changes. The systems are platform
independent, and have been tested on several MS Windows and
Linux. Several preconﬁgured versions, including ones for type
2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and autoimmune diseases are
packed into .war web-application archives. AIMS/SIMS can be
installed either as local (e.g. on a laptop) or as centralized databases.
Installation for local use is a simple two-step procedure that does not
require special database software (java light database h2 is used).
Filtering functionality is customizable, for enumerated value ﬁelds
a drop-down list can be provided, ﬁelds are deﬁned as parameters.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The systems development effort up to now is ∼8 person-years.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the only open source web-
based system that integrates capturing of rich phenotypic data with
management of high-throughput data from multiple platforms for
needs of multi-site collaborative projects and that has already proven
its usefulness. We are currently running three SIMBioMS instances
to support collaborative projects, including an instance containing
data from over 25 000 assays on nine different technology platforms,
and an instance for population-wide epidemiology studies. We
have implemented protocols for data transfer to the permanent
data archives: ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2008) and European
Genotype Archive (EGA) and data from over 6500 assays have been
transferred. In the future, the system will be extended to include
next-generation sequencing data. Source code, documentation,
initialization scripts, templates for metadata conﬁguration, links to
demo instances and user guide are available at http://simbioms.org.
