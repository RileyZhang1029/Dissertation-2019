ABSTRACT
Motivation: Secondary structure prediction of RNA sequences is an
important problem. There have been progresses in this area, but the
accuracy of prediction from an RNA sequence is still limited. In many
cases, however, homologous RNA sequences are available with the
target RNA sequence whose secondary structure is to be predicted.
Results:
In this article, we propose a new method for secondary
structure predictions of individual RNA sequences by taking the
information of their homologous sequences into account without
assuming the common secondary structure of the entire sequences.
The proposed method is based on posterior decoding techniques,
which consider all the suboptimal secondary structures of the target
and homologous sequences and all the suboptimal alignments
between the target sequence and each of
the homologous
sequences. In our computational experiments, the proposed method
provides better predictions than those performed only on the basis
of the formation of individual RNA sequences and those performed
by using methods for predicting the common secondary structure
of the homologous sequences. Remarkably, we found that the
common secondary predictions sometimes give worse predictions
for the secondary structure of a target sequence than the predictions
from the individual target sequence, while the proposed method
always gives good predictions for the secondary structure of target
sequences in all tested cases.

1 INTRODUCTION
Secondary structure prediction of RNA sequences is one of the most
important fundamental problems in biological sequence information
analysis. The importance of accurate predictions has increased due
to the recent ﬁndings in functional non-coding RNAs. Although
a number of algorithms and tools have been developed for this
problem (e.g. Andronescu et al., 2007; Do et al., 2006a; Hamada
et al., 2008; Hofacker et al., 1994; Parisien and Major, 2008),
their accuracies are limited. In real cases, however, it is expected

(cid:3)

that the accuracies can be improved by taking into account the
information of RNA sequences that are homologous to the target
RNA sequence whose secondary structure is to be predicted. There
have been proposed several methods with this respect (e.g. Hamada
et al., 2006; Hofacker et al., 2002; Kiryu et al., 2007b).

The problem targeted by this article is deﬁned as follows.
Problem 1. Given a single RNA sequence x and a set of its
homologous sequences D, predict a secondary structure of x using
the information of D.

It is assumed that x and each sequence x

in D share a common
secondary structure, and the secondary structure of x is predicted by
combining information present in D. This problem can be solved by
mapping the predicted common structure of the entire sequences to
the target sequence as follows: (i) compute a multiple alignment
A for the set of sequences D∪{x} (e.g. Do et al., 2005, 2008;
Tabei et al., 2008), (ii) predict a common secondary structure of
A (e.g. Bernhart et al., 2008; Hamada et al., 2008; Seemann et al.,
2008) and (iii) predict a secondary structure of x by mapping the
predicted common secondary structure to the target RNA sequence x.
The obtained secondary structures are more reliable in general
than the predictions only from individual sequences. There are
problems in the above approach, however, because the secondary
structures of individual sequences are not exactly the same as
the common secondary structure and the quality of the multiple
alignment strongly inﬂuences the performance of the prediction.

In this article, we propose a novel estimator for Problem 1
which yields a direct prediction of the secondary structure of x
by combining the information of the homologous sequences D
without assuming the multiple alignment or the common structure
of the entire sequences (Fig. 1). The proposed method models
the probabilistic distribution of the pairwise common structure
between the target RNA sequence and each homologous sequence,
and maximizes the expected accuracy of the prediction of the
target RNA sequence under the combined probabilistic distribution.
The expectation is calculated under all the suboptimal secondary
structures of the target sequence and under all the suboptimal
pairwise alignments of the target sequence and its homologous
sequences using posterior decoding method, which is based on a
posteriori probabilities such as base-pairing probabilities of RNA or
match probabilities of alignment and has been successfully applied
in bioinformatics (Bradley et al., 2008; Carvalho and Lawrence,

decoding methods are used in the maximum expected accuracy
(MEA) estimator of CONTRAfold (Do et al., 2006a), the centroid
estimator (Carvalho and Lawrence, 2008; Ding et al., 2005) and
the γ -centroid estimator of CentroidFold (Hamada et al., 2008). We
demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method
outperforms that of conventional secondary structure prediction
methods.

2 METHODS
2.1 Discrete spaces and probability distributions
In this article, the following discrete spaces and probability distributions on
those spaces play important roles in order to deﬁne proposed estimators.
2.1.1 A space of secondary structures: S(x) A secondary structure of
an RNA sequence x is represented as an upper triangular binary matrix
θ ={θij}i<j, where the (i,j) element θij of the matrix θ is equal to 1 if
xi and xj form a base pair and to 0 if xi and xj do not form a base pair
(Fig. 2). A consistent secondary structure represented by θ should satisfy the
θji ≤1 for any j (each position in a
following constraints: (i)
sequence is allowed to form a base pair with one other base at most), and (ii)
θij+θkl ≤1 for any i < k < j < l (the formation of any two base pairs which
results in a pseudo-knot is not allowed). We denote with S(x) the space of
all secondary structures θ of an RNA sequence x. Note that to predict the
secondary structure of x is equivalent to predicting a point θ in S(x). We
obtain a probability distribution p(s)(·|x) on S(x) by using the McCaskill
model (McCaskill, 1990), the CONTRAfold model (Do et al., 2006a), the
Simfold model (Andronescu et al., 2007) and the SCFG model (Dowell and
Eddy, 2004). By using the distributions, a base-pairing probability p(s,x)
,
which is the probability with which xi and xj form a base pair, is computed as
θ∈S(x) I(θij =1)p(s)(θ|x), where I(·) is the indicator
p(s,x)
ij
function, which takes a value of 1 or 0 depending on whether the condition
constituting its argument is true or false. We refer to {p(s,x)
}i<j as a base
pairing probability matrix, which can be computed by using the inside–
outside algorithm (e.g. McCaskill, 1990), whose time complexity is O(|x|3)
where |x| is the length of x.

2.1.2 A space of pairwise alignments: A(x,x
) Similarly to the secondary
structure of an RNA sequence, a pairwise alignment of two sequences x
and x
(e.g. DNA sequences, RNA sequences or amino acid sequences) is
represented as a binary matrix θ ={θik}i,k, where θik =1 if xi is aligned with
k and θik =0 if xi is not aligned with x
(cid:3)
(cid:3)
k (Fig. 3). A consistent alignment
x
θik ≤1 for
represented by θ should satisfy the following constraints: (i)
θik ≤1 for any k, (iii) θik+θjl ≤1 for any i < j and l < k. In this
any i, (ii)

(cid:3)
is denoted by A(x,x

We can obtain the probability distribution p(a)(θ|x,x

) by using
the PHMM model (Durbin et al., 1998), the Miyazawa model (Miyazawa,
1995), the ProbAlign model (Roshan and Livesay, 2006), the CONTRAlign
model (Do et al., 2006b). By using the distributions, the alignment match

2.2 Designing estimators for Problem 1
Most of the existing decoding methods are regarded as the following
estimators (e.g. Carvalho and Lawrence, 2008; Hamada et al., 2008): if
Y is a space from which we would like to obtain a prediction, referred to as
a predictive space,  is a space which is referred to as a parameter space
and is potentially different from the predictive space, p(θ|d) is a probability
distribution on the parameter space  given a dataset d, and G(θ,y) is a
gain function between  and Y, then an estimator on the predictive space is
deﬁned as

ˆy=arg max

y∈Y

Eθ|d[G(θ,y)]=arg max
y∈Y

G(θ,y)p(θ|d)

(1)

(cid:3)

θ∈

(cf. Ding et al., 2005; Do et al., 2006a; Hamada et al., 2008; Kiryu et al.,
2007b). Here, we can design a superior estimator by deﬁning the gain
function and the parameter space appropriately. For example, (Hamada et al.,
2008) have proposed an estimator which maximizes the expectation α1TP+
α2TN−α3FN−α4FN (αn >0, n=1,2,3,4) with respect to a probability
distribution on S(x), and conﬁrmed that their estimators are superior to
the MEA estimator used in CONTRAfold (Do et al., 2006a). Regarding
Problem 1, we would like to predict the secondary structure of x so that the
predictive space Y is S(x). Therefore, it is necessary to deﬁne the parameter
space  and the probability distribution p(θ|x) on the parameter space .
In the following sections, we introduce several estimators: an estimator with
less heuristics, and its approximations with some heuristics.

(cid:3)∈ D
2.2.1 Estimator 1 Our assumption in Problem 1 is that x and every x
share a common secondary structure. The common secondary structure is

(See Section 2.1.3).

averaged number of a pair (xi,xj) which forms a base pair in the set of
structural alignments {θ xx
=1) is equal
to the averaged number of a pair (xi,xj) which does not form a base pair in
the set. Hence, the more base pairs (xi,xj) there exist in the set of structural
alignments, the more gain in the gain function is given for the prediction
yij =1. Then, we deﬁne the estimator which maximizes the expectation of
the gain function G(1)(θ,y) on the probability distribution p(1)(θ|x,D) as

RNA secondary structure predictions

target RNA sequence (and its homologous sequences) and all suboptimal
pairwise alignments between the target sequence and each of homologous
sequences. The proposed estimators have three parameters, α, γ and δ: the
parameter α of the estimator appro3-1 represents the weight of the target
sequence relative to its homologous sequences; γ is the parameter that strikes
the balance between the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the predictions; and δ
represents the probability cutoff that inﬂuences the speed and accuracy of the
algorithm. In Section 3.3, we conﬁrm the relation between these parameters
and prediction performance, and decide to set α=1/(1+|D|) and δ=0.01
as default parameters.

3 EXPERIMENTS
We conducted all experiments in this section on our
linux
cluster machines, each of which has 2 GHz CPU of AMD
Opteron(tm) Processor 246 and 4 GB memory. The accuracy of
predicted secondary structures was evaluated through the following
standard evaluation measures: Sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN) and
PPV=TP/(TP+FP), where TP is the number of correctly predicted
base pairs, FN is the number of base pairs in the reference structure
that were not predicted and FP is the number of incorrectly predicted
base-pairs. In all the ﬁgures described below, we plot the curve
at γ ∈{2k :−5≤ k≤10,k∈ Z}∪{6} for the proposed estimators,
the averaged γ -centroid estimators and the γ -centroid estimators
(Hamada et al., 2008), which are implemented in the CentroidFold
software.

3.1 Dataset
We used three datasets in our experiments. A summary of our
datasets is described in Table 1.

3.1.1 The dataset1 We created a dataset called ‘dataset1’ by
utilizing the dataset in Kiryu et al. (2007b) which contains 85
reference alignments of 10 sequences taken from 17 RNA families
in the Rfam database (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2005) as follows: we
selected each RNA sequence in each alignment in the Kiryu’s dataset
as a target sequence x and the other sequences in the alignment
as homologous sequences D. The reference structure of the target
sequence x is given by mapping the consensus structure in the
alignment to the target sequence. As a result, we obtained 850 test
data, each of which contains a target sequence and nine homologous
sequences. Note that the dataset in Kiryu et al. (2007b) contained
only the manually curated seed alignments with the consensus
structures published in literature.

3.1.2 The dataset2 and dataset3 We created dataset called
‘dataset2’ and ‘dataset3’ from the RNA STRAND database

(Andronescu et al., 2008), which contains manually curated RNA
secondary structures of any type and organism. We selected
reference secondary structures of target sequences out of 3704 non-
redundant entries in the database, which satisfy all of the following
conditions: (i) containing one molecule, (ii) not containing any
ambiguous characters (i.e. any characters excluding A, U, G, C and
T) (iii) not included in the family type ‘Other *’, ‘Synthetic RNA’
and ‘Unknown’ and (iv) whose length is more than 50 (500) nt
and less than or equal to 500 (1500) nt for the dataset2 (the dataset3,
respectively). We also created homologous sequences D of the target
sequence by randomly selecting 2–20 sequences in the same family
of the target sequence. As a result, the numbers of test data in the
dataset2 and the dataset3 are 1547 and 215, respectively.

3.2 Compared methods
In the following sections, we compared the proposed method with
three types of methods (Fig. 1) for Problem 1 as follows. Note
that the default parameters were used in each tool unless the
parameters were speciﬁed. (M1) Predict a secondary structure of
a target RNA sequence x without using homologous sequence
information. In this method, we used the tools of secondary
structure prediction from an individual RNA sequence: RNAfold
version 1.8.1 (Hofacker et al., 1994), SimFold in MultiRNAFold-
1.11 with the ISMB 2007 best parameters (Andronescu et al.,
2007) and CentroidFold version 0.0.4 (Hamada et al., 2008)
with the CONTRAfold model
(Do et al., 2006a), which is
theoretically and experimentally superior to CONTRAfold itself.
(M2) Align {x}∪D and predict a common secondary structure of
the predicted multiple alignment, and then mapped the common
secondary structure to the target sequence x. In this method,
we used the tools of the multiple alignment of RNA sequences:
ProbCons (RNA) (Do et al., 2005), RAF v1.00 (Do et al., 2008),
MXSCARNA version 2 (Tabei et al., 2008) and the tools of the

common secondary structure prediction from multiple alignments of
RNA sequences: PETfold v1.0 (Seemann et al., 2008), RNAalifold
version 1.8.1 (Bernhart et al., 2008) which was recently updated,
and CentroidFold version 0.0.4 (Hamada et al., 2008) with the
CONTRAfold model which implemented the averaged γ -centroid
estimators. (M3) Simultaneously align and fold {x}∪D, and map the
common secondary structure on the structural multiple alignment
to the target sequence x. We used RAF v1.00 (Do et al., 2008)
in this method. Note that this method can calculate the most likely
structural alignment and its common secondary structure, sacriﬁcing
extremely huge computational time compared with M1, M2 and the
proposed method.

3.3 Comparison within proposed methods
In this section, we mainly evaluated the performance of the proposed
estimators with the various probabilistic models of p(s) and p(a),
and the various parameters in the proposed method. We used the
probability distribution p(s)(·) on S(x) for an RNA sequence x in the
McCaskill model (McCaskill, 1990) and the CONTRAfold model
(Do et al., 2006a), and also used the probability distribution p(a)(·)
on A(x,x
in the ProbCons model
(Do et al., 2005) and the ProbAlign model (Roshan and Livesay,
2006). Note that the ﬁxed alignment is not required in the proposed
method, while the method (M2) requires ﬁxed alignments.

First, we aimed at determining the inﬂuence of the parameters α
(which is used only in appro3-1) and δ in the proposed estimators
on the dataset1. Figure 6a and Supplementary Figure S1 show the
results of various α parameter when we set δ=0. These show the
suitability of α parameter in the appro3-1 for around 0.1, which
is equal to α=1/(|D|+1) where |D|=9 in this experiment since
each test data in dataset1 contains nine homologous sequences. This
suggests that the same weight between the target RNA sequence x
and each sequence in D provided good prediction performance, and

α=1/(|D|+1)=0.1. In both ﬁgures, we used p(a) in the ProbCons model and p(s) in the CONTRAfold model. The performance of the other combinations
of probability distributions is shown in the Supplementary Material (Figs S1–S3).

it seems to be a natural result. We also investigated the inﬂuence of
the parameter δ described in Section 2.2.3. As shown in the Figure 6b
(also see Supplementary Figs S2 and S3) in the case that δ < 0.01,
the performance is almost the same as that of δ=0. On the other
hand, the total calculation times of the proposed estimator δ=0.01
are much faster than that of δ=0 (Table 2). Therefore, we decided
to use α=1/(|D|+1)=0.1 and δ=0.01 in next experiments.
Second, we conducted an experiment for comparing appro3-
1 and appro3-2 as described in Section 2.2.3. As shown in
Figure 7a, appro3-1 outperformed appro3-2 under
the same
conditions (i.e. probability distributions p(a) and p(s)). We can
observe that the best combination of the proposed estimators and
the probability distributions is appro3-1 with the CONTRAfold
model and the ProbCons model. Moreover, in order to examine the
difference in performance of appro2-1 as described in Section 2.2.2
and appro3-1 as described in Section 2.2.3, we implemented
the variant of the forward–backward algorithm for computing

shows that appro3-1 provided almost the same performance as
appro2-1, indicating that the approximation used in Section 2.2.3
does not inﬂuence the performance at all.

3.4 Comparison with the other methods
In this section, we compared the proposed estimator with the other
existing methods described in Section 3.2. For our method, we
chose ‘appro3-1 with the CONTRAfold model and the ProbCons
model for α=1/(1+|D|) and δ=0.01’ (|D| is the number of
homologous sequences), which achieved the best performance
in the above experiments in several combinations of estimators,
p(s) and p(a). This combination is denoted with the ‘proposed’
method below. First, we conducted an experiment on the dataset1
(see Section 3.1.1), which was also used in the previous section,
and the result
is shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary
Material. This result shows that the proposed method is better or
comparable performance compared with the method (M1), (M2)
and (M3). In this experiment, however, someone may be concerned
about the over-ﬁtting of the parameters α and δ in the proposed
method (although the used parameters are very natural) because
we determined the parameters on the dataset1 or simpliﬁcation
of the dataset1. Hence, we also conducted other experiments on
the dataset2 and the dataset3. Figure 8 shows the result of the
experiment on the dataset2. Remarkably, the approaches of the
common secondary structure predictions (M2) with ProbCons and
MXSCARNA alignments gave worse performance than the single
secondary structure predictions (M1). This shows that quality of
alignment strongly inﬂuences the performance of the prediction in
the method (M2). We think that this is because alignment errors
inﬂuence the performance and common secondary structures are
not always good for a predicted secondary structure of the target

the family such as Signal Recognition Particle RNA (SRP RNA),
Transfer Messenger RNA (tmRNA) and RNaseP RNA, which
contain diverse sequences from a number of organisms (Andronescu
et al., 2008).

We also conducted an experiment on the dataset3 (See
Section 3.1.2), which contains longer RNA sequences than the
dataset2. Due to the computational cost, we conducted the
experiment for the proposed method,
the methods (M1) and
(M2) with ProbCons (Do et al., 2005). The result shown in
Figure 9 indicates that the proposed method outperforms the other
methods such as probcons-centroid (common secondary structure
prediction after aligning target and homologous sequences), simfold
(secondary structure prediction from target sequences) and so
forth. Table 3 also shows that the proposed method can predict
secondary structures within practical calculation time even for
long sequences. The experiments on the dataset1 and the dataset2
demonstrate that the methods using RAF (Do et al., 2008) are
comparable with the proposed method, but these are obviously
much slower than the proposed method (Table 3). It should be
also emphasized that the proposed method is much better than
‘probcons-centroid’ [that predicts a common secondary structure
by using averaged γ -centroid estimators (Hamada et al., 2008)
after aligning the target sequence and homologous sequences
by ProbCons (Do et al., 2005)], although these two methods
employ the similar features (that is, both methods use base-pairing
probabilities of the target sequence and homologous sequences
given by the CONTRAfold model). The proposed method uses

Fig. 10. An example of predicted secondary structures of
tRNA
(ID:SPR_00633) in the RNA STRAND database (Andronescu et al., 2008).
We used eight homologous sequences containing four unusual
tRNA
sequences (SPR_00397,00629,00832,00938) whose secondary structures
lack the D-domain stem–loop.

Figure 10 and Supplementary Figure S5 show a typical example
which supports the advantage of
the proposed method. We
used a tRNA sequence (SPR_00633) as the target sequence,
and eight homologous sequences containing four unusual tRNAs
(SPR_00397,00629,00832,00938), whose secondary structures
lack the D-domain stem–loop, in the RNA STRAND database
(Andronescu et al., 2008). These sequences are so remote that no
alignment tools could produce an accurate multiple alignment of
them for predicting a common secondary structure. This seems to
lead to the insufﬁcient prediction of the methods (M2) and (M3). The
method (M1) also failed in predicting a secondary structure of the

RNA secondary structure predictions

target sequence, whereas the proposed method could successfully
predict a secondary structure of the target sequence. This result
suggests that the information of the homologous sequences can
improve the quality of the secondary structure prediction even if
several remote homologs are included.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we designed a novel estimator for Problem 1, based on
the posterior decoding techniques. The proposed method considers
all the suboptimal alignments between the target sequence and its
homologous sequence, and all the suboptimal secondary structures
of the target sequence and homologous sequences. This is one of
the advantage of the proposed method, while common secondary
structure predictions after aligning the target and homologous
sequences [the method (M2)] consider the only optimal alignment.
The proposed method also solves Problem 1 directly, while (M2)
and (M3) are indirect methods for the problem, because they predict
common secondary structures instead of secondary structures of the
target sequence. In the computational experiments, we conﬁrmed
that the proposed method achieved better prediction accuracy and
more efﬁcient computational time than the other methods.

Remark that a similar idea described in Section 2 leads to
an estimator on the alignment problem, which relates to the
probabilistic consistency transformation (PCT) (Do et al., 2005).
The proposed method can be regarded as a variant of the PCT,
which transforms base-pairing probabilities of each homologous
sequence into those of the target sequence through alignment match
probabilities between the target sequence and the homologous
sequence.

RAF (Do et al., 2008) and the proposed method employ the
same strategy that a probability distribution of structural pairwise
alignment p(sa)
is factorized into that of secondary structures
p(s) and that of pairwise alignments p(a). RAF uses p(s) and
p(a) for composing a scoring function of structural alignments
and for reducing the search space of the Sankoff-style dynamic
programming algorithm. Although this makes RAF to be one of
the most efﬁcient tools among several implementations of the
Sankoff algorithm, RAF is still much slower than the different
approaches such as (M1) and (M2) as shown in Section 3.4. The
proposed method also uses p(s) and p(a) for composing the efﬁcient
scoring (gain) function of predicting secondary structures of target
sequences by combining the information of homologous sequences,
and succeeds in both keeping the quality of secondary structure
predictions and reducing the computational time compared with
RAF, despite the use of the same information as RAF.

In this article, we considered global pairwise alignments for
computing p(a). Alternatively, we can employ the local alignment
models, instead of the global alignment models, which may enable
to incorporate the partial homology information such as domain
motifs of functional RNAs in order to further improve the secondary
structure prediction of target sequences.
