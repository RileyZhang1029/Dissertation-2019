ABSTRACT
Motivation:
Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced RNA inter-
ference is an endogenous pathway in sequence-speciﬁc gene
silencing. The potency of different siRNAs to inhibit a common
target varies greatly and features affecting inhibition are of high
current interest. The limited success in predicting siRNA potency
being reported so far could originate in the small number and the
heterogeneity of available datasets in addition to the knowledge-
driven, empirical basis on which features thought to be affecting
siRNA potency are often chosen. We attempt to overcome these
problems by ﬁrst constructing a meta-dataset of 6483 publicly
available siRNAs (targeting mammalian mRNA), the largest to date,
and then applying a Bayesian analysis which accommodates feature
set uncertainty. A stochastic logistic regression-based algorithm is
designed to explore a vast model space of 497 compositional,
structural and thermodynamic features, identifying associations with
siRNA potency.
Results: Our algorithm reveals a number of features associated
with siRNA potency that are, to the best of our knowledge, either
under reported in literature, such as anti-sense 5(cid:3)–3(cid:3) motif ‘UCU’, or
not reported at all, such as the anti-sense 5(cid:3)-3(cid:3) motif ‘ACGA’. These
ﬁndings should aid in improving future siRNA potency predictions
and might offer further insights into the working of the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC).

1 INTRODUCTION
RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing
(PTGS) mechanism which inhibits gene expression. It is mediated
by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or by transcripts that form stem-
loops (short hairpin RNA, shRNA).

(cid:3)

During the process of RNAi, dsRNA/shRNA is split by the
Ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer into 19-nt dsRNA molecules with
2-nt 3
-overhangs, named short interfering RNA (siRNA, depicted
in Figure 1). The siRNA then interacts with the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC), speciﬁcally with its catalytic component,

the Argonaute protein. RISC-Argonaute separates the two strands
of the siRNA molecule into the guide strand (anti-sense to the
targeted mRNA), which is loaded into the Argonaute protein,
and the passenger strand (sense to the targeted mRNA), which is
released into the cytoplasm and subsequently degraded (Lodish
et al., 2004). In a following step,
the RISC–siRNA complex
probes cytoplasmic mRNA molecules for sequence complementarity
to the loaded siRNA guide strand. Matching mRNA molecules
are cut around the center of the siRNA–mRNA interaction site
(cleavage site) by the Argonaute protein, effectively inhibiting the
expression of the respective gene product. Wang et al. have recently
published a crystallographic structure of the complex, taken from
an eubacterium (Wang et al., 2008).

Not long after its discovery, it was known that not all siRNAs are
equally potent (Holen et al. 2002). The search for potent siRNAs
and for features that could explain their silencing capabilities has
since become the focus of numerous research groups in the ﬁeld.

Initially, most groups conducted experiments on smaller sets of
mRNAs. They measured the capability of different siRNA sequences
to silence their respective gene products and tried to identify features
that could be linked to the reported siRNA potency. Until recently,
the focus was on compositional or thermodynamic features, both
of which are sequence-based. Compositional features describe the
occurrences of certain nucleotides at certain positions of the siRNA
sequences, whereas thermodynamic features are concerned with
binding free energies and stabilities of the sequences. A third group
of features used in literature are structure-based ones (Shao et al.,
2006, 2007; Vickers et al., 2003). These include secondary structure
characteristics of both the siRNA and its mRNA target. According to
Patzel et al., siRNAs with no deﬁned secondary structure correlate
with increased potency (Patzel et al., 2005). Moreover, one would
expect target accessibility to be decisive for whether an otherwise

well-designed siRNA can bind to its complementary part on the
mRNA sequence (Ding et al., 2004). Researchers who incorporated
mRNA characteristics in their feature set reported that, although
they appear to be correlated with siRNA potency when no additional
features were selected, they seemed to offer little to the predictive
strength of their models, when added to an existing set of sequence-
based features (Katoh and Suzuki, 2007; Peek, 2007). Others,
however, did report correlation of site accessibility with siRNA
potency (Shao et al., 2006).

Some researchers prefer to work on purpose-build datasets
produced by them (Katoh and Suzuki, 2007; Reynolds et al., 2004;
Shao et al., 2006; Ui-Tei et al., 2004), which are usually small
and target only a few mRNAs. By contrast, others perform their
analysis on combined data from heterogeneous sources (Holen,
2006; Matveeva et al., 2007; Saetrom, 2004; Shabalina et al., 2006;
Vert et al., 2007). The latter is becoming increasingly popular, as
the amount of publicly available data steadily increases. The large
dataset by Huesken et al. (Huesken et al., 2005) can be seen as a
landmark towards this direction.

A problem with studying heterogeneous datasets though is the
variability in the biological methods employed, as well as in the
information provided to the scientiﬁc community. As an example,
earlier studies tended to employ 19-nt sequences (Ui-Tei et al.,
2004), while more recent studies use 21-nt siRNA sequences,
taking the 2-nt 3
siRNA overhangs into account. These 2-nt
overhangs appear to be correlated with siRNA potency (Huesken
et al., 2005); however, this correlation cannot be tested on a 19-nt
dataset. Matveeva et al. encounter this problem in their recent study
(Matveeva et al., 2007), as they build two prediction models based
on a 21-nt dataset, but can only test them on three 19-nt datasets.

(cid:3)

Another problem encountered when combining data from
heterogeneous sources is the lack of detailed information regarding
the target sequence, such as which particular transcript was targeted
and what the exact sequence of that transcript is. Such issues render
the incorporation of structural mRNA information into a model
challenging.

Having gathered the experimental data, a variety of statistical
methods can be employed in an attempt to determine which features
of a candidate siRNA sequence inﬂuence its potency. These include
simple linear regression-based methods (Matveeva et al., 2007;
Shabalina et al., 2006; Ui-Tei et al., 2004; Vert et al., 2007) as
well as more complex methods like neural networks (Huesken
et al., 2005; Shabalina et al., 2006), Euler graphs (Pancoska
et al., 2004), Support Vector Machines (Ladunga, 2007; Peek,
2007; Saetrom, 2004; Teramoto et al., 2005), genetic programming
(Saetrom, 2004) and disjunctive rule merging (Gong et al., 2008).
With the performance of linear regression-based methods shown to
be comparable to most of the more complex methods (Matveeva
et al., 2007; Shabalina et al., 2006; Vert et al., 2007), linear
regression has proven to be a reasonable choice, given its simplicity
of concept and implementation and the interpretability of the results
it produces. For these reasons, it was decided to be employed in this
study.

We have investigated an approximate Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo feature selection algorithm using a Bayesian
Information Criteria (BIC)
to
approximate the Bayes factor for a logistic regression model on a
large meta-dataset of 6483 siRNA’s that we constructed employing
the most widely used, publicly available datasets (we focus only

on siRNAs that target mammalian mRNA). As far as the authors
are aware this is the largest study of its kind to date. By following a
purely data-driven approach, we hoped to conﬁrm most of the recent
ﬁndings, to resolve cases with contrasting evidence from different
studies and to discover novel features that associate with siRNA
potency.

A stochastic approach was considered essential,

in order to
efﬁciently explore the vast feature space of 497 compositional,
thermodynamic and structural features that were put together to be
tested for association with siRNAs potency. These covered most,
if not all, of the features reported in recent studies, resulting in the
most extensive set of features worked on so far. As a result, we
present an efﬁcient algorithm which succeeds in identifying novel
features that signiﬁcantly affect siRNA potency while performing
comparably to most successful recent prediction methods (see
Supplementary Material for more details). We then employ our
algorithm to suggest 10 potent siRNAs for each of the human
mRNA listings in the NCBI RefSeq database (Pruit et al., 2007;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq). These results can be found
at our website.

2 METHODS
2.1 Consensus format for siRNA sequences
The following set of rules was chosen in this study, deﬁning how siRNA
sequences and the measurement of their respective silencing efﬁcacy are
presented:

(cid:129) siRNA sequences are stated as anti-sense sequences from 5

(Figure 1)

(cid:129) Potency (synonymous to efﬁciency and efﬁcacy) refers to the ability of
an siRNA to inhibit (synonymous to knock-down and down-regulate)
a gene product

(cid:129) Product level refers to the percentage of the gene product remaining

after siRNA-mediated RNA interference

(cid:129) Product levels of zero and one are assigned to fully potent and non-

potent siRNAs, respectively

(cid:129) Compositional features are represented with the initial of the base
followed by its position on the anti-sense strand, e.g. U7 means Uracil
at nucleotide position 7 of the siRNA anti-sense strand.

2.2 Features
Four hundred and ninety-seven features have been included in our systematic
study spanning position-dependent nucleotide preferences, GC content of
the siRNA sequence, presence of 2-, 3- and 4-mer sequence motifs,
presence of known innate inferon response-stimulating motifs, occurrence of
palindromes, thermodynamic features and structural features of the siRNA.
Most of the features that were tested in recent studies and found to be
correlated with siRNA potency have been included in our feature set. In
addition, the set was enriched by features that were not been tested before
(e.g. tetranucleotide free energy differences). For a detailed description of
each group of features and an exhaustive list of the features included in this
study, please refer to the Supplementary Material.

The columns for dataset, size and reference refer to the name and abbreviation, the number of siRNA samples contained and the reference to the dataset, respectively. Strand format
indicates which strand is reported in the original study: sense (S) or antisense (AS). In the next column the siRNA concentration, as reported in the respective study, is stated.
Furthermore, potency is either reported in a continuous scale over [0, 1], where 0 represents fully potent and 1 non-potent or as discrete value, where samples are split into different
potency classes.
aFor these datasets, siRNA data has been collected from various experiments, all at slightly different experimental condition, so a common value for siRNA concentration used
cannot be stated.

datasets, which were either purpose-built
(Katoh and Suzuki, 2007;
Phipps et al., 2004) or collections of other, earlier published ones (Matveeva
et al., 2007; Saetrom, 2004; Shabalina et al., 2006). In a pre-processing step,
we limited our data to siRNA sequences targeting mammalian mRNA.

We focused at siRecords as it represents one of the largest resources
of curated siRNA data, which is accessible to academic/non-commercial
users by download (current release: 18 Aug 2008). Other online databases,
such as HuSiDa (http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/∼nebulus/sirna/index.htm)
or siR (Reynolds2004, http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/
sirna.html), are available and will be considered for inclusion into future
versions of our dataset.

In our report, we refer to the combined datasets of Shabalina et al.
(Shabalina et al., 2006) and Saetrom et al. (Saetrom, 2004) as SHA
and SAE, respectively to highlight the fact that we obtained the data
from the aforementioned sources. These datasets though are themselves a
heterogeneous set of data produced by many different groups (Aza-Blanc et
al., 2003; Giddings et al., 2000; Harboth et al., 2003; Holen et al., 2002;
Hsieh et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2003; Kawasaki et al., 2003; Khvorova
et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2003; Reynolds et al., 2004; Ui-Tei et al., 2004;
Vickers et al., 2003). A summary, highlighting the key features of each dataset
and a reference for each, is presented in Table 1.

The task of combining data from heterogeneous sources into a single
meta-analysis study is not straightforward. Two of the key problems are
(i) the inconsistency in measuring and reporting siRNA potency (Jagla
et al., 2005) and (ii) the fact that reported results might refer to either
sense or antisense strand siRNA sequences, and the necessary transformation
to make ﬁndings comparable might introduce errors (Leuschner et al.,
2006). Both of these problems are addressed in detail in the Supplementary
Material.

It should be highlighted that in studies which are not speciﬁcally aimed
at assessing silencing efﬁcacy of siRNA sequences and where candidate
samples have been picked with the help of a design algorithm the reported
siRNAs will not represent the full spectrum of possible sequences, eventually
introducing a bias. Moreover, in such cases often only the potent siRNAs are
reported, leading to over-representation of potent siRNAs over non-potent,
as is the case for the siRecords (SIR) database. Combining data from various

sources should aid in reducing these biases, allowing us to better explore the
siRNA sequence state space.

Another issue to be taken into consideration for all siRNA potency
studies is the concentration of siRNA used in the silencing experiment.
It can be seen in Table 1 that the concentrations of siRNA employed
in the various experiments vary. It is generally accepted that silencing
efﬁciency will be compromised when using too low siRNA concentrations.
On the other hand, too high concentrations can induce non-speciﬁc, off-target
effects (Persengiev et al., 2004), which can be reduced, albeit not alleviated
(Jackson2003b), by reducing the siRNA concentration. Even though some
groups report very similar siRNA potencies for concentrations varying
between 20–100 nM (Jackson et al., 2003; Semizarov et al., 2003), there
appears to be no consensus on the optimal amount to use—a value, which
might well be gene- and tissue-speciﬁc.

Although a breakdown of the data according to siRNA concentration
employed in the study might have increased the power of our study, we
decided not to pool our data due to the already small number of available
siRNA samples (compared to the vast siRNA state space). Given that a
slight concentration-speciﬁc difference in silencing efﬁciency is likely to
exist in our dataset, we expect a small artiﬁcial increase in variance, which
we deem unlikely to have any effect on the selection of the most important
predictors.

Concentrations were not reported for the siRecords database. However, as
will be shown in detail below, the leave-one-out approach followed by our
algorithm yielded similar results qualitatively when SIR data was excluded
from the training set. This could mean that the siRNA concentrations
employed to derive most of the entries in SIR are similar to those in
the other datasets, or that the feature selection process is not signiﬁcantly
affected by difference in concentrations amongst datasets, or both. A proof
of this statement will be left to a follow-up study which will hopefully
be conducted in the light of a larger available dataset and more complete
data.

Starting with our pool of nine datasets (SLO, ISI, AMG, NOV, KAT, SHA,
SAE, SIR, PHI), all datasets were ﬁrst checked for uniqueness and then
cross-checked against each other to retrieve a set of unique and independent
datasets. ISI, AMG and SHA were found to be fully contained in SIR and

datasets to be included in this study:

(cid:129) SIR: SIR without entries from ISI, AMG, KAT, SHA, PHI and SAE

(2240 sequences)

(cid:129) SAE: unique entries of SHA, PHI and SAE (509 sequences)

The resulting ratio of potent to non-potent entries for each database is given
in Table 2. The combined set has a ratio of approximately 1:1.

The full dataset for our study contained 6483 unique and experimentally
validated 19nt siRNA sequences in anti-sense description. To classify siRNA
entries from the various datasets in terms of product levels, we employed
an arbitrary, but commonly used, threshold of 0.3. Product levels <0.3 and
≥0.3 indicated potent and non-potent siRNA, respectively. This threshold
is only employed for initial classiﬁcation; the actual potency threshold
changes to satisfy the 95% speciﬁcity criterion, as explained in detail in
the Supplementary Material.

2.4 Algorithm
A strictly data-driven approach was followed for the model selection with
no a priori assumptions about biological signiﬁcance or relative importance
of features were incorporated into our model at any time. All features were
considered equally likely to affect siRNA potency.

Our model exploration algorithm generated models by sampling features
from their posterior probability given the data,
through the stochastic
selection from the 497-element feature set and calculating the respective
logistic regression parameters for subsets of the features (see details below).
Each generated model was a candidate for inclusion in the ﬁnal model set,
which was then used to make predictions of siRNA potency, in the form of
remaining product levels after siRNA activity.

A BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) scheme was employed as a
probabilistic scoring measure. The BIC approximates for any feature set the
log posterior probability under a Bayesian model (cf. Kass and Raftery, 1995)
and is proportional to L– 1/2 p log n, where L is the maximum log-likelihood,
n is the number of samples in the training set, and p the number of selected
features. The BIC is an approximation to the Bayesian marginal likelihood
which integrates out over uncertainty in parameter coefﬁcient values. The
Bayes marginal likelihood is known to contain a natural penalty against
over-complex models and hence parsimonious models are preferred under
this approach (cf. Bernardo and Smith, 2000). We use a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, employing the BIC as an approximation to the
true marginal likelihood of any model, to generate models (or feature sets)
in proportion to their posterior probability. MCMC is a generic approach to
generating samples from a complex target distribution and is well suited to
the task of variable set uncertainty (cf. Gelman et al., 2003)

Hence we probe the 497-dimensional feature space using a MCMC
algorithm, as detailed below, from which we are able to characterize feature

set relevance, (cf. Kass and Raftery, 1995; Kass and Wasserman, 1995;
Raftery, 1995).

The algorithm starts from an initial feature set and evolves it over time in

a stepwise manner, which is outlined in the following:

(i) INITIAL STEP: An initial feature set is chosen and the respective BIC-
weighted log-likelihood of the model, comprised by these features, is
calculated. The feature list and the penalized log-likelihood are referred
to as features_active and result_active in the following.

For each step one of the following is done with equal chance:

(a) REMOVE: Randomly remove a feature from features_active
(b) ADD: Randomly add a feature to features_active
(c) SWAP: randomly add a feature to features_active while removing

another feature at the same time

(ii) The modiﬁed feature list is then stored as features_proposed and the

BIC of the new model is calculated and stored in result_proposed

(iii) IF result_proposed > result_active (the proposed model performs

better)

(a) Accept the proposed model
(b) features_proposed becomes features_active
(c) result_proposed becomes result_active

(iv) ELSE (the proposed model performs worse)

(a) Calculate a measure of change between result_proposed and

result_active as

(b) α = exp(result_proposed – result_active),
(c) Draw a random number from a unit distribution RAND∼U(0,1).
(d) IF RAND ≤ α,

(1) Accept the proposed model even though it performs worse

than the active one

(2) features_proposed becomes features_active
(3) result_proposed becomes result_active

(e) ELSE

(1) Reject the proposed model
(2) features_active remains unchanged
(3) result_active remains unchanged

(v) Store features_active in features_sets(i)
(vi) REPEAT steps 1, 2 for i = 1,2,…,NRUNS
(vii) Skip the ﬁrst NSKIP entries of features_sets(i) which represent the burn-
in phase of the algorithm, containing more than average variations in
the features selected.

(viii) Check the remaining features sets for unique feature sets and store them
in unique_feature_sets. Store the number of percental appearance of
each unique feature set in kMODEL

(ix) Calculate predictions for all of the unique models, each being deﬁned

by an entry in unique_feature_sets

(x) Weight each prediction according to the respective entry in kMODEL.

(a) Both unique_feature_sets and kMODEL contain NUNIQUE entries.

(xi) FINAL STEP: The ﬁnal prediction of our Monte-Carlo algorithm is a
kMODEL-weighted average of the predictions of the NUNIQUE models
deﬁned in unique_feature_sets.

The above scheme samples the feature sets according to their posterior
probability measure Pr( feature set | data). This in turn means that multiple
models with high predictive power are explored and, due to the employed
model averaging, the predictive power of a large set of individual models is
combined into one single prediction.

3 RESULTS
We ran our Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) feature
selection algorithm for 1 100 000 iterations—including a 100 000
iteration burn-in phase—starting three times with the Matveeva et al.
Model2 (Matveeva et al., 2007) as initial feature set, and two more
times with initial models composed of randomly picked features. For
each initial model, we trained our algorithm on ﬁve different training
datasets and then went on to test its performance on a test dataset.
The training datasets for each of these runs were composed of four
of our ﬁve datasets (SLO, NOV, KAT, SAE, SIR) and the remaining
dataset was used as the test dataset (leave-one-out scheme). By using
all ﬁve possible combinations, we arrived at a total of 25 runs (ﬁve
initial models times ﬁve training/test dataset combinations), together
representing 25 000 000 iterations of our algorithm.

The output of each of these 25 runs consisted of a list of percentile
appearance of each of the 497 features during the 1 000 000 Bayesian
MCMC iterations of the respective run. In a next step, all 25 lists
retrieved from our runs were combined and the overall percentile
occurrence of each feature in all 25 runs (representing 25 000 000
iterations of our algorithm) was calculated. A ﬁnal list with the 19
features most dominant in all models generated by the Bayesian
MCMC algorithm is depicted in the Table 3. These are features
contained in more than 33% of the models generated in all 25
runs. This cut-off is arbitrary and was chosen so that the number
of features selected by our algorithm matches that of the model
against which we validated our results (Matveeva et al., 2007, cf.
Supplementary Material). The results of the model, comprised of
only these 19 features, compare favourably with the performance
of the most recent algorithms, further validating our approach to
feature selection (cf. Supplementary Material).

By using varying initial models for our Bayesian MCMC
algorithm, we ensured that no bias was present in our simulations.
Furthermore, the fact that all runs of the algorithm—irrespectively of
the initial feature set—lead to comparable results indicates that our
algorithm converged. This is reinforced by the fact that the average
model sizes do not change signiﬁcantly between different runs (cf.
Supplementary Material).

The fact that only thirteen of the 497 features were present in
more than 50% of all Monte-Carlo generated models can be taken
as an indicator of the complexity of the silencing mechanism and
the variability of the factors that can potentially affect it. One could
argue that the vast feature space would have led to some degree
of overlap, resulting in a spreading of the intensity of a stronger
signal over a range of features. The inclusion of a SWAP step in
our Bayesian MCMC algorithm, as well as of features spanning
different classes (compositional, motifs, structural, thermodynamic)

appearance of each feature (100% representing an appearance of 25 000 000 times in
the models generated by our algorithm), the correlation between the feature and the
product level variable (positive correlation coefﬁcient indicates an increasing of siRNA
potency), as well as its biological meaning. The ﬁrst thirteen features appear in more
than 50% of the runs.

in our analysis should solve overlap issues though, minimising any
masking of signiﬁcant features by less inﬂuential ones.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

3.1 Motifs
It is particularly interesting that one of the most important features
detected by our algorithm is the 3-mer 5
motif, ‘UCU’, which
has, in the main, escaped the notice of previous siRNA potency
studies. More speciﬁcally, Teramoto et al. (Teramoto2005) do not
report it at all, whereas Vert et al. (Vert et al., 2007) include it in their
table of included features, but do not make any special reference to
it in their main text or any other distinction between ‘UCU’ and all
other motifs studied by them.

–3

‘UCU’ has a positive correlation coefﬁcient, which means that it
increases siRNA potency. Including all datasets, 60% of the siRNAs
containing the motif are potent for a product level threshold of 0.3
(cf. Table 4). More speciﬁcally, motif ‘UCU’ was found present at
least once in 2560 siRNAs, of which 1538 were potent. Exclusion
of the SIR dataset, where the product level was stated as an ordinal
and not as a continuous value, led to qualitatively similar ﬁndings,
strengthening the conﬁdence in this ﬁnding. A detailed breakdown
of the motif’s occurrences by position in the siRNA sequence can
be found in Supplementary Material.

[18:05 15/6/2009 Bioinformatics-btp284.tex]

Page: 1598

1594–1601

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

It is important to highlight that the positive correlation found
between ‘UCU’ and silencing efﬁcacy is unlikely to reﬂect
a structural or compositional characteristic of
the sequences
containing the speciﬁc motif, as such features were checked for
correlation by our Bayesian MCMC algorithm, but were not selected
as signiﬁcant. Other reasons, such as a possible codon-speciﬁc bias,
can also be excluded (cf. Table 4). Hence, this motif appears to
complement the thermodynamic and compositional characteristics
that have been previously found to affect siRNA potency, seemingly
having a role of its own in the silencing process.

Having established a correlation between the ‘UCU’ motif
and siRNA potency, we looked for position-speciﬁc effects (cf.
Supplementary Material). This revealed increased siRNA potency
for samples containing the ‘UCU’ motif at either end of the anti-
sense sequence, with a marked drop for samples with the motif at
positions NT10-12 and NT11-13. The fact that the drop is observed
even when ‘UCU’ is at positions NT11-13 suggests that it cannot
be explained on the basis that potent siRNAs prefer an Adenine
at NT10, the cleavage site. This is also supported by the fact that
the preference for Adenine at NT10 has also been selected as a
signiﬁcant feature by our algorithm.

–3

A second 5

motif which seems to affect siRNA potency is
the tetranucleotide ‘ACGA’. This is a previously unreported motif
which, in contrast to ‘UCU’, appears to negatively affect siRNA
potency. Of 219 siRNAs that contain this motif, only 80 appear to
be potent. In this case, a position-speciﬁc analysis cannot be applied
with conﬁdence, given the small number of samples containing that
motif (see Supplementary Material for a breakdown of the motif’s
occurrence by siRNA sequence position). However, it is worth
noting that, when ‘ACGA’ appears in positions NT1-4, NT8-11 or,
mainly, NT4-7 of the siRNA anti-sense strand, it leads to increased
siRNAs potency, whereas in all other positions, and in particular
after NT10, it leads to reduced siRNAs potency (cf. Supplementary
Material).

Other features which have been selected less often by our
algorithm, such as motifs ‘GUGG’, ‘GCC’ and ‘UCCG’, might also
be found to be of more importance when larger datasets become
available for study in the near future.

Motif ‘UGGC’, which has been previously reported to induce
sequence-dependent cell toxicity (Fedorov et al., 2006), was not
selected by our MCMC algorithm, although it is well represented in
the sample (present in 4.5% of the samples). Moreover, the feature
was not found to be signiﬁcantly correlated with siRNA efﬁciency,
when we performed a single linear regression test.

(cid:3)

3.2 Thermodynamic features
Four of the features present in more than 50% of the Monte-Carlo
generated models describe thermodynamic properties of the siRNA.
It has already been reported that potent siRNA sequences tend
to have a less stable 5
-end (Matveeva et al., 2007; Peek, 2007;
Reynolds et al., 2004; Shabalina et al., 2006). Our results conﬁrm
this ﬁnding, but suggest that the thermodynamic stability of the
ﬁrst tetranucleotide, dG1−4, is a more decisive factor for siRNA
potency than that of the ﬁrst dinucleotide dG1−2, contrary to what
has been reported recently (Lu and Mathews, 2008). Similarly, our
results suggest feature dG5−8 as preferentially selected over the
previously reported dG7−8 (Matveeva et al., 2007), conﬁrming that
the thermodynamic stability of the ﬁrst 7 nt of the siRNA is important

Approximate Bayesian feature selection

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

for its silencing efﬁciency. The stability of the 3
-end of the siRNA
seems negatively correlated with siRNA potency, also in line with
previous ﬁndings (Holen, 2006; Jagla et al., 2005).

and 3

A free energy difference between the 5

-ends of the
antisense strand, which was previously pointed out as important
(Lu and Mathews, 2008; Matveeva et al., 2007), was not selected
explicitly by our algorithm—neither in the form of a dinucleotide
free energy difference (dG1−2 - dG18−19), a tetranucleotide free
energy difference (d4G1−4 - dG16−19), nor in any combination
of dinucleotide/tetranucleotide free energy differences (dG1−2 -
dG16−19, dG1−4 - dG18−19). In contrast,
the free energies of
both the ﬁrst tetranucleotide (dG1−4) and the last dinucleotide
(dG18−19) were selected as separate features, in ∼85% and ∼59%

of the models, respectively. One way of explaining this is by
speculating that the asymmetry between the two ends, which has
been previously indicated as important for choosing which of the
strands is incorporated into RISC (Shabalina et al., 2006) is not
the sole reason that renders the ﬁrst tetranucleotide (primarily) and
the last dinucleotide as important indicators of siRNA efﬁciency.
It should be noted here that Matveeva et al. (Matveeva et al.,
2007) have also included the dinucleotide free energies dG1−2
and dG18−19,instead of the respective dinucleotide free energy
difference (dG1−2 - dG18−19),
in their models. They, however,
do not mention their reasoning behind that decision. In order to
conﬁrm our speculation, our MCMC algorithm was rerun, leaving
the dinucleotide and tetranucleotide free energies of the ends of
the antisense strand out, while keeping all other features, including
the differences in free energy between the two ends, in. For this
reduced feature set, our algorithm did pick up dG1−4 - dG18−19,
indicating that it does explain some variation of siRNA potency,
but less than that explained when features dG1−4and dG18−19 are
selected together. It should be noted that if dG1−4 - dG18−19 had
the same explanatory power as the features dG1−4and dG18−19, it
would have shown up in the initial set-up instead, as the penalized
likelihood scheme employed favours models with smaller number
of features.

3.3 GC content
A connection between GC content and siRNA potency was
previously reported by a variety of studies (Gong et al., 2006; Holen
et al., 2002; Matveeva et al., 2007; Pei and Tuschl, 2006; Reynolds
et al., 2004 ). Our MCMC algorithm revealed three GC thresholds
as signiﬁcant for predicting siRNA potency: GC content >35%, GC
content <70% and GC content <75%. As the two upper limits for
GC content show both a similar correlation and are occurring equally
often, we assume the true value to be around 73%. Our algorithm
therefore shows that siRNA candidate sequences with GC content
in the range of 35–73% have an increased potency. This differs for
the GC content windows that were previously proposed (Matveeva
et al., 2007; Shao et al., 2006), and it could be considered more
reliable, given that it is based on a larger and more diverse dataset.

Secondary structure

3.4
The folding energy of the siRNA sequence, calculated as in (Peek,
2007), is another factor which seems to affect siRNA potency.
Given that position-speciﬁc bond-formation features are absent
from the majority of models returned by our algorithm, the effect
of siRNA secondary structure formation on the resulting siRNA

1594–1601

J.W.Klingelhoefer et al.

potency appears to be adequately captured by the folding energy
of the siRNA sequence.

The remaining features selected by our MC algorithm have
been previously reported in literature. These include compositional
features such as nucleotide U1 (U at NT1), A1 and A10 positively
correlated with siRNA potency, and G14, G18 and A19, found to be
negatively correlated. The correlation for thermodynamic stabilities
dG13−14 and dG18−19 are in line with previous ﬁndings (Matveeva
et al., 2007) as well.

4 DISCUSSION
The present study had the incentive to explore the feature space
more thoroughly than other studies so far, whilst employing the
largest meta-dataset reported in literature. We did this in the hope
that novel features would be discovered, enabling improved siRNA
potency predictions and aiding in a better understanding of the
silencing process. It was shown that a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo variable selection method can be successfully employed as a
method to quantify the evidence in sets of features and marginally for
individual features. This is especially useful when the feature space
is too big to be explored deterministically. Moreover, the method
can be used to obtain a list of potentially potent siRNAs, which can
be further enhanced once additional information, such as transcript
details and 3
overhang data, become available for all entries. Note,
however, that our method in its current implementation does not
account for siRNA target speciﬁcity and structure.

(cid:3)

(see Supplementary Material

While our algorithm compares well with recently developed
siRNA potency predictors
for
comparative results), the most important part of this study lies in
the identiﬁcation of novel features as signiﬁcant predictors. Motifs
‘UCU’ and ‘ACGA’ in particular were consistently selected by our
MCMC algorithm. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, neither
of these has been previously reported in the literature as being
important for siRNA silencing efﬁciency. Moreover, the fact that
these motifs were selected from a feature set spanning different
classes of features and not just motifs reduces the chance of them
capturing other, non-speciﬁc effects.

(cid:3)

The ﬁnding that the tetranucleotide thermodynamic stability at
-end of the siRNA sequence, dG1−4, is more decisive for
the 5
siRNA potency than the dinucleotide stability, dG1−2, is also very
interesting in terms of understanding the mechanism of siRNA
incorporation into the RISC complex. It
is also worth noting
that thermodynamic features dG1−4 and dG5−8appear to be more
important for efﬁcient RNA interference than all compositional ones,
apart from the presence of Adenine at NT10, the cleavage site.

It seems clear that future research on siRNA design should attempt
to include all possible feature classes in the selection process. We
believe we have demonstrated that this can lead to satisfying results.
As the amount of available data increases, inferences should be
easier to make, and weaker correlations could be captured.

One can only speculate whether the general level of predictive
accuracy for siRNA potency is low because of the innate diversity
of the siRNA silencing approach, or because some of the important
explanatory features are still to be discovered. A crucial step towards
answering this question is the availability of the right data, in the
right format. So far, there is no consensus on how biological data is
extracted or results are reported. This makes comparison of different
datasets a challenging and time consuming process. A uniﬁed

1600

framework would greatly facilitate the replication of reported results
and data sharing between different groups. MIARE (Minimum
Information About an RNAi Experiment, www.miare.org), a set of
guidelines on the information that should be reported for every RNAi
experiment, is a signiﬁcant step towards this direction.

Through the identiﬁcation of the actual features that inﬂuence
siRNA-mediated RNA interference, a better understanding of the
underlying biological processes could be achieved.
