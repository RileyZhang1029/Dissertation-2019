ABSTRACT
Motivation: B-cell epitope is a small area on the surface of an antigen
that binds to an antibody. Accurately locating epitopes is of critical
importance for vaccine development. Compared with wet-lab meth-
ods, computational methods have strong potential for efficient and
large-scale epitope prediction for antigen candidates at much lower
cost. However, it is still not clear which features are good determinants
for accurate epitope prediction, leading to the unsatisfactory perform-
ance of existing prediction methods.
Method and results: We propose a much more accurate B-cell epi-
tope prediction method. Our method uses a new feature B factor
(obtained from X-ray crystallography), combined with other basic phy-
sicochemical, statistical, evolutionary and structural features of each
residue. These basic features are extended by a sequence window
and a structure window. All these features are then learned by a two-
stage random forest model to identify clusters of antigenic residues
and to remove isolated outliers. Tested on a dataset of 55 epitopes
from 45 tertiary structures, we prove that our method significantly
outperforms all three existing structure-based epitope predictors.
Following comprehensive analysis, it is found that features such as
B factor, relative accessible surface area and protrusion index play an
important role in characterizing B-cell epitopes. Our detailed case
studies on an HIV antigen and an influenza antigen confirm that our
second stage learning is effective for clustering true antigenic residues
and for eliminating self-made prediction errors introduced by the first-
stage learning.

1 INTRODUCTION

B-cell epitope is the binding site of an antibody on an antigen.
It can be recognized by a specific B lymphocyte to stimulate an
immune response. If both the antigen and its binding antibody
are known, the epitope site can be accurately determined by
wet-lab experiments,
such as by X-ray crystallography.
However, it takes a great deal of time and labor to identify the
epitope(s) of an unknown antigen and its specific antibody.
Computational methods have strong potential for efficient and
large-scale epitope prediction for many antigen candidates at
much lower cost. Early computational prediction methods have
focused on the identification of linear epitopes, which are simple
forms of B-cell epitopes.

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A linear epitope is composed of a single continuous sequence
segment. The early prediction methods have assumed that there
should be a good and simple correlation between certain propen-
sities and linear epitope residues, and attempted to predict linear
epitopes through one or two propensities. For example, hydro-
philicity was used by Hopp and Woods (1981) and Parker et al.
(1986), flexibility by Karplus and Schulz (1985), protrusion index
(PI) by Thornton et al. (1986), antigenic propensity by Kolaskar
and Tongaonkar (1990), amino acid pair by Chen et al. (2007)
and -turns by Pellequer et al. (1993). To enhance the robustness
of the prediction, various ideas of sliding windows have been
proposed (Chou and Fasman, 1974) and applied in linear epitope
prediction (Hopp and Woods, 1981; Karplus and Schulz, 1985;
Westhof, 1993). However, the sliding window approach is over-
simplified and the prediction performance was not improved
significantly (Chen et al., 2007). In 2005, Blythe and Flower
derived 484 amino acid propensity scales from the AAIndex
and found that even the best set of scales and parameters
performed only marginally better than random methods. They
recommended the use of more sophisticated methods for epitope
prediction (Blythe and Flower, 2005). Other research works have
tried to use machine learning methods such as Hidden Markov
Model (Larsen et al., 2006), Recurrent Neural Network (Saha
and Raghava, 2006) and Support Vector Machine (Chen et al.,
2007) to improve performance for linear epitope prediction.

The other form of B-cell epitope is called conformational
epitope. A conformational epitope consists of discontinuous
stretches of residues that are tightly connected after folding in
3D space. As over 90% of epitopes are conformational
(Andersen et al., 2006) and an increasing number of protein
structures have recently become available, close attention has
been shifted to the problem of conformational epitope prediction
(Andersen et al., 2006; Kulkarni-Kale et al., 2005; Lo et al., 2013;
Moreau et al., 2008; Ponomarenko et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2009;
Sweredoski and Baldi, 2008; Zhao et al., 2012). DiscoTope
(Andersen et al., 2006) is one of the first methods to study
conformational epitopes based on structural data. It combines
the structural proximity sum of sequentially smoothed log-odds
ratios with contact numbers to derive a prediction score. Another
novelty of the method is that it uses the concept of structural
window to smooth the physicochemical propensities. A later
method called ElliPro (Ponomarenko et al., 2008) takes advan-
tage of the PI (Thornton et al., 1986) and makes use of a residue
clustering algorithm to predict both linear and conformational
B-cell epitopes for a protein sequence or protein structure.
ElliPro does not have a training process, but the parameter
thresholds must be set before implementation. The SEPPA
method (Sun et al., 2009) introduces a novel concept of ‘unit
patch of residue triangle’ to describe the local spatial context

of the protein surface. It also incorporates clustering coefficients
to describe the spatial compactness of surface residues for
epitope prediction. A more recent work in this area is the anti-
body-specific B-cell epitope prediction (Zhao et al., 2011). This
method can accurately predict the more useful antibody-specific
epitopes rather than antigenic residues. But it requires more prior
information, e.g. antibody structure or sequence information. It
is not applicable to a new virus when its antibody is unknown. In
spite of intensive research, the prediction performance by all of
these methods still needs much improvement.

In this work, we propose a much more accurate epitope
prediction method named CeePre (Conformational epitope
prediction). Two new ideas are adopted by CeePre. First,
CeePre uses a new feature B factor in the learning process, com-
bined with many other physicochemical, statistical, evolutionary
and structural features of the residues. These features are also
extended by a sequence window and a structure window to
derive composite features. B factor is an important parameter
of protein X-ray crystallography. It measures the flexibility/rigid-
ity of residues/atoms in a protein 3D structure. A higher B factor
score implies more flexibility of the atom/residue. It has been
found that low B factors are usually distributed at the core of
unbound interfaces (Swapna et al., 2012). The second new idea is
that CeePre is a two-stage model under the random forest learn-
ing process (Breiman, 2001). In the first stage, the original 304
features are used to predict the potential antigenic residues. In
the second stage, the predicted class labels from the first stage are
added to the feature space to cluster nearby antigenic residues to
form epitopes and remove isolated antigenic or non-antigenic
residue predictions. This idea is based on the hypothesis that
the aggregated antigenic residues are more likely to constitute
epitopes, while the isolated antigenic residues are probably
wrongly predicted. This idea is effective to eliminate self-made
prediction errors to obtain really meaningful final results.

predictors
(DiscoTope, ElliPro and SEPPA). With a comprehensive ana-
lysis of the important features suggested by random forests in the
epitope prediction, it is found that B factor, relative accessible
surface area (RSA) and PI play an important role in improving
prediction performance. Our analysis also confirms that whether
a residue is involved in an epitope is affected by nearby residues
both in sequence and in space, and thus it is a good idea to use
both the sequence and structure window to construct the feature
vector.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Datasets
The structure data in this work consists of two types: quaternary struc-
tures and tertiary structures. Quaternary structures are used to determine
which residues are in an epitope, while tertiary structures are used to
extract feature scores of candidate residues. The structure data are com-
piled via the steps presented below.

2.1.1 Quaternary structures and epitope residues A dataset con-
taining 107 non-redundant antigen–antibody complexes (Kringelum

Epitope prediction by CeePre

et al., 2013) is used. Some (e.g. T-cell antigens) are removed according
to the following criteria.

 Only one symmetric unit is used within each complex. If a complex
contains more than one symmetric unit, redundant units are
removed, as carried out by Ponomarenko and Bourne (2007).

 Complexes 1NFD, 1XIW, 1YJD and 2ARJ are removed because
their antibodies interact only with the T-cell chains and have no
interaction with antigen chains. 1QFW is also removed because its
antigen chains are from the gonadotropin alpha subset.

In total, 102 quaternary structures are used to determine the B-cell
epitopes. An epitope residue is an antigen residue such that there exists
at least one heavy atom of this antigen residue that is within 4 A˚ distance
from a heavy atom of a residue of the antibody (Ponomarenko et al.,
2008).

2.1.2 Tertiary structures Traditional structure-based epitope predic-
tion methods typically use quaternary structure datasets (Andersen et al.,
2006; Kringelum et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2009). From a practical perspec-
tive, the prediction should be conducted under the assumption that the
corresponding antibodies are unknown. In other words, using tertiary
structures rather than quaternary structures is more reasonable for the
analysis and prediction of epitopes. Simply separating the antigens from
the quaternary structures is not a good idea to get the tertiary structure
data. This is because the antigen side in a quaternary structure contains
the binding information (Supplementary Fig. S1); for example, residues
bound by antibodies are less flexible and have smaller B factors in the
quaternary structure. It is unfair to use the binding information to predict
epitope sites in an unbound status. Therefore, to obtain the correspond-
ing tertiary structures of the antigens from the quaternary structures is
non-trivial.

We take an alignment approach to the construction of our tertiary
structure dataset from the quaternary structure data. First, the antigens
in the quaternary structures are aligned with every tertiary structure in
Protein Data Bank (PDB). A tertiary structure is selected if the sequence
similarity is495% and the epitope residues can be completely aligned. By
this step, 34 complexes are removed, as they cannot be aligned with any
tertiary structure under the 95% sequence similarity condition. 1EGJ is
also removed because it can only be aligned with 1C8P, which
is determined by NMR (not X-ray). Twelve more complexes are removed
because their epitopes cannot be completely mapped onto the
corresponding tertiary structures.

After this filtering process, 55 quaternary structures are retained and
their corresponding epitopes are mapped onto 45 tertiary structures. For
some cases, two or more antigens from quaternary structures are mapped
onto the same tertiary structures. Supplementary Table S1 shows the
dataset details and the mapping between the quaternary structures and
the tertiary structures. All the feature scores of the residues in this work
are extracted from the tertiary structures rather than the quaternary
structures.

2.1.3 Non-epitope residues
In general, except for epitope residues all
other surface residues in a tertiary structure can be considered to be
non-epitope residues. In particular, Rost and Sander (1994) have con-
sidered a residue to be a surface residue if its RSA is 415%, while the
RSA threshold is set at 25% by Deng et al. (2009). The absolute value of
the accessible surface area (ASA) has also been used to identify surface
residues. Jordan (2010) has adopted a threshold of 5 A˚ 2 to define surface
residues. Using a simple statistic on the RSA of epitope residues in our
dataset, we find that 475% of epitope residues have an RSA 425.9%.
Thus, we take the criterion RSA 25% (Deng et al., 2009) to define surface
residues. As a result, there are 725 epitope residues and 6504 non-epitope
residues in our datasets.

J.Ren et al.

A key issue here is that the numbers of epitope residues and non-
epitope residues are imbalanced. The epitope residues are just a little
more than 10% of the non-epitope residues. If this imbalanced dataset
is used in training, the classifier would tend to categorize every residue as
non-epitope. Therefore, we sample non-epitope residues randomly to
obtain the same number of non-epitope residues as that of the epitope
residues to produce a balanced dataset. CeePre is trained on these
balanced datasets and tested on both the balanced dataset and the imbal-
anced dataset.

2.2 Feature space of residues

(1985); Kolaskar and Tongaonkar

2.2.1 Basic features including our newly proposed B factor A
variety of features have been studied by Chen et al.
(2007); El-
Manzalawy et al. (2008); Hopp and Woods (1981); Janin (1979);
Karplus and Schulz
(1990);
Pellequer et al. (1993); Sollner et al. (2008); Thornton et al. (1986). In
addition to our newly introduced B factor feature to characterize epitope
residues, many of those traditionally used physicochemical features,
statistical features, evolutionary features and structural features are also
collected by this work (Table 1). In total, there are 38 features as our basic
features (Supplementary Table S2), including 20 PSSM features and 8
secondary structure features. The B factor score of each residue is the
average B factor of all of the atoms in this residue.

2.2.2 Window-based features: extended composite features The
location of epitope residues can be influenced by their nearby residues in
sequence and spatially. We introduce two windows to capture this influ-
ence: a sequence window and a structure window. Features whose value
scores are calculated according to the residues within a window are called
window-based features.

 A total of 38 smoothed features by a sequence window. The size of
the sequence window is 7 (Andersen et al., 2006), i.e. the sequence
window of a residue i covers residues i  3, i  2, i  1, i, i + 1, i + 2,
i + 3. We use the average value of each basic feature v over this
window to obtain the smoothed value of v for residue i. It is
named a smoothed feature v0. As there are 38 basic features, we
can obtain an additional 38 smoothed features for each residue.
Note that the window size is adjustable.

 A total of 228 new features by a structure window. A surface residue
is inside a structure window of a target residue if the distance be-
tween any atom of the target residue and an atom of the surface
residue is less than a threshold (window size: 10 A˚ , adjustable).
We calculate the maximum, minimum and average of all of the resi-
dues in the structure window of each residue for every basic or
sequence-window smoothed feature u. This process introduces 228
[(38 + 38) 3] composite features, which are named structural
maximum, minimum or average features of u. With this addition,
we use a total of 304 (38 + 38 + 228) features to characterize every
residue.

Figure 1 summarizes the process of constructing feature space from

tertiary structures.

2.3 Prediction method

2.3.1 Two-stage learning Our prediction method CeePre has two
stages of learning:

 The first stage of learning is by the random forest model (Breiman,
2001) on a training dataset of residues described by our 304 features.
The trained model is named CeePre1. CeePre1 can predict the class
labels of the residues in a test dataset. It can also predict the class
labels of the training residues. CeePre1 is depicted in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. The learning and test of CeePre1

 The second stage of learning consists of four steps. Step 1: train a
CeePre1 model on a training dataset described by the 304 features,
and obtain the predicted class labels for the training data and the test
data. The predicted class labels of the training data are given by an
internal 10-fold cross-validation process over the training data itself.
Step 2: expand the 304-feature vector by adding four features
through a structure window and the predicted class labels of
CeePre1. The four new features of the residues are (i) the predicted
class label of CeePre1, (ii) the number of predicted epitope residues in
the window, (iii) the number of predicted non-epitope residues in the
window and (iv) the ratio of the predicted epitope residues over all
the residues in the window. Step 3: train the random forest model on
the enriched training dataset described by 308 features. The trained
model is named CeePre2. Step 4: apply CeePre2 to predict the class
labels of the residues in the test dataset described by the same 308
features and to get the test performance. Figure 3 illustrates the
learning and test processes of CeePre2.

CeePre1 focuses on the accurate prediction of antigenic residues.
On top of CeePre1, CeePre2 concentrates to cluster separate antigenic
residues and to eliminate isolated false positives and false negatives.
Generally, spatially aggregative antigenic residues more easily constitute
epitopes. On the contrary, isolated antigenic residues are not likely to be a
part of an epitope. Taking this principle, CeePre2 converts the prediction
results of CeePre1 into the four features at the second stage to integrate
separated antigenic residues into a cluster of epitope residues, enhancing
the prediction performance for many cases.

2.3.2 Random forest Random forest is used as our learning model.
Random forest is an ensemble method proposed by Breiman (2001).
It constructs multiple decision tree classifiers and obtains the final pre-
dictions by voting. It has many advantages (Han et al., 2006). Firstly, it is
robust to errors and outliers and can avoid over-fitting. Secondly, its
accuracy
(e.g.
AdaBoost), but it is much faster. Also, it gives an internal estimate of
variable importance.

Many software packages contain the random forest algorithms. An
implementation of random forest in R package by Liaw and Wiener
(2002) is used here. There are two important parameters: the number
of trees to grow and the number of features selected as candidates at
each split. In the learning process, we build 100 trees and determine
feature numbers by optimizing F-score.

2.4 Evaluation metrics
CeePre is evaluated under six metrics: accuracy, recall, specificity,
precision, F-score and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Recall,
specificity and precision reflect the prediction tendencies of classifiers.
Recall (sensitivity or TP recognition rate) and specificity (TN recognition
rate) illustrate the percentage of correct predictions for positive and
negative samples. A corresponding criterion is precision showing the
percentage of correct positive-labeled samples. There is a trade-off
between precision and recall. Recall favors positive-bias predictions,
while precision favors negative predictions.

Accuracy (recognition rate) describes how well the classifier recognizes
both positive samples and negative samples. It is effective only when the
samples are evenly distributed. If positive and negative samples are imbal-
anced, classifiers apt to predict samples, as the majority class will achieve
better accuracy. The F-score combines precision and recall and can be
used to assess the performance of classifiers on both balanced datasets
and imbalanced datasets. MCC is another metric that can be used to
evaluate a classifier’s performance, especially on imbalanced datasets.
It returns a value between  1 and +1: +1 stands for a perfect predic-
tion, 0 for random prediction and  1 for totally reversed prediction.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We first compare our CeePre model with three other structure-
based epitope predictors (DiscoTope, ElliPro, SEPPA). The
evaluation is based on both the balanced datasets and the
whole imbalanced dataset. In this section, we also highlight
several B factor-related features, which are important in epitope
prediction.

3.1 Evaluation on the balanced datasets

A 10-fold cross validation procedure is conducted on our
balanced datasets consisting of all the 725 epitope residues and
725 non-epitope residues obtained by sampling. The sampling is
operated three times to obtain three different non-epitope residue
datasets. The mean value and standard deviation of each metric
over the three samplings are reported to eliminate the bias
induced by sampling.

The performance of CeePre and those of the other three
predictors are presented in Table 2. CeePre (CeePre1 and
CeePre2) exhibits excellent performance on the balanced
datasets, surpassing the other three predictors on all metrics.
Specifically, the F-score of CeePre2 is 0.89, 0.31 higher than
the best F-score (SEPPA) of the other predictors. The MCC of
CeePre2 is 0.77, which is four times more than the best MCC of
the other three predictors (0.19 by SEPPA). Accuracy is mean-
ingful on the balanced datasets: the accuracy of CeePre2 is 0.88,
0.29 better than the best accuracy (SEPPA) of
the other
predictors. In summary, CeePre shows excellent performance
on the balanced datasets.

We can also see that CeePre2 outperforms CeePre1 in terms of
almost all metrics except for slight decrease in specificity. For
example, the recall of CeePre2 is improved to 0.93 because more
epitope residues are identified. The improvement is attributed to
the idea that CeePre2 adds the prediction results of CeePre1 into
the four new features expanded in the second learning stage.
CeePre2 also removes some isolated epitope and non-epitope
residue predictions and clusters nearby epitope residue and

non-epitope residue predictions. This is reasonable because all
residues in an epitope are typically spatially close to each other.
On the other hand, one or two isolated residues should not
become an epitope. The slight decrease in specificity probably
implies the discovery of previously unknown epitopes in the ter-
tiary structures, as the epitopes have not been fully annotated
so far.

3.2 Evaluation on the whole dataset

In a real scenario, the number of epitope residues and non-epi-
tope residues are not equal. To make the results more convincing
in practice, we show a 10-fold cross validation result on the
entire dataset, where the proportion of epitope residues and
non-epitope residues is 1:9. For each fold, the training is on
nine parts of the balanced dataset, and the test is on one part
of the epitope residue data and all of the remaining non-epitope
residues (not only the one part of the non-epitope residue data in
the balanced dataset). The 10-fold cross validation process is
repeated three times each with a different sampling of the non-
epitope residues. The mean value and the standard deviation of
each criterion are recorded in Table 3.

Again CeePre has far better performance than the other three
predictors under all metrics. It achieves an F-score of 0.54, which
is twice as much as the best F-score (SEPPA) of the other three
predictors. Its MCC is 0.53, while the best MCC of the others
is only 0.11. Compared with CeePre1, its recall improves signifi-
cantly to 0.93, indicating that most of the epitope residues are
identified. However, the precision and specificity of CeePre2
show a slight decrease, which is partly due to the incomplete
determination of epitopes in PDB.

CeePre also has better recall, precision and specificity than the
other three predictors. In terms of specificity, DiscoTope has a
higher specificity (0.82) than ElliPro and SEPPA, which is

slightly less than the specificity of CeePre2, but the recall of
DiscoTope is only 0.23. This signifies that DiscoTope mistakes
most of the epitope residues for non-epitope residues. In con-
trast, ElliPro prefers to recognize more residues as epitope resi-
dues, and thus shows a high recall value (0.76) and a low
precision (0.1). Nevertheless, its recall is still much less than the
recall of CeePre. This is probably because ElliPro only uses one
feature (PI) in the prediction. SEPPA compromises epitope resi-
due predictions and non-epitope residue predictions; thus, it has
medium recall and specificity, but higher precision than the other
two. However, the highest values of all three metrics of the other
three predictors are lower than those obtained by our CeePre
method.

Important features for prediction

A variety of features, including physicochemical features, statis-
tical features, evolutionary features and structural features, are
used by CeePre. Not all of them play an equally important role in
the prediction. Their contribution to the prediction performance
varies. The most effective features should have both significant
biological and computational importance. In this section, we
report
important features for epitope prediction.
These features are ranked by the random forest model, as
shown in Figure 4.

the most

Figure 4b shows that the four new features extracted from the
prediction results of CeePre1 by a structure window do play a
significant role in CeePre2, indicating a strong clustering effect.
Other features, especially RSA (V73) and ASA (V71), are also
top ranked in CeePre2. Figure 4a gives a more detailed descrip-
tion of the weighty features for characterizing epitope residues.
This ranking procedure is repeated on three training samplings.
Only those features that appear three times in the top-30 features
or twice in the top-20 features are reported in Table 4.

Fig. 4. Ranking of top-30 important features in CeePre. (a) Shows the
top-30 important features in the original 304 features. (b) Illustrates the
top-30 important features of all the 308 features in CeePre2. In CeePre2,
the four additional features are the prediction result of CeePre1 (V305),
the number of predicted epitope residues in the structure window
(V306), the number of predicted non-epitope residues in the structure
window (V307) and the rate of predicted epitope residues in the structure
window (V308)

3.3.1 Relative accessible surface area RSA and ASA are
top-ranked among all the features. This signifies that the surface
accessible area of residues can effectively distinguish epitope resi-
dues from non-epitope residues on protein surfaces. The RSA
distribution of epitope residues and non-epitope residues on pro-
tein surfaces is appreciably distinct (Fig. 5). The mean RSA of
epitope residues is 46.0%, while that of non-epitope residues is
54.2%. Epitope residues are less surface-exposed than other
surface residues. With a Mann–Whitney U hypothesis test
assuming that the RSA of epitope and non-epitope residues

are under the same distribution, the hypothesis is rejected
(P-value: 0). This means that there is a clear distinction in the
distribution of RSA between epitope and non-epitope residues.

3.3.2 B factor Another important feature is B factor, which is a
characteristic used to indicate the mobility of atoms. The atoms
buried in proteins are typically less mobilizable and have a smal-
ler B factor, while those exposed on the surface are more flexible
and have a larger B factor. B factor is widely used in studies on

i269

J.Ren et al.

Fig. 6. Box plot of B factor distribution for epitopes and non-epitopes

Fig. 8. Box plot of PI for epitopes and non-epitopes

epitopes on the stem region (often conserved epitopes)
locate at those residues where the B factor is low (blue),
while the epitope on the head region (often less conserved)
has slightly higher B factors (green). This is because the
HA1 itself is more flexible than HA2 and thus has higher
B factors.

3.3.3 Protrusion index PI, a widely used structural feature
(Ponomarenko et al., 2008; Thornton et al., 1986), proves to
be effective in the prediction, as shown in Figure 8. The
mean PI of epitope residues is 0.87 and that of non-epitope
residues is 1.07. That is, epitopes are more concave on the
surface. The P-value of the Mann–Whitney U hypothesis test
on PI is 0,
indicating its effectiveness in identifying epitope
residues.

3.3.4 Other features Besides the structural features discussed
above, traditional physicochemical features such as -turns,
hydrophobicity and flexibility are also highly ranked in epitope
prediction. The epitope residue predictions are affected by
physicochemical features of residues that are nearby in sequence
or have spatial proximity. As can be seen from Table 4, the
top-ranked physicochemical features are mostly smoothed over
the sequence window (‘Smoothed’) or the structural window
(‘Average’, ‘Maximum’ or ‘Minimum’). In particular, some of
them, such as -turns and hydrophilicity smoothed over the se-
quence window or the structural window, strongly reflect the
influence of nearby residues on epitope residue predictions.
Therefore, applying the sequence window and the structure
window on these features contributes to the identification of
the epitope residues.

4 CASE STUDIES

CeePre is trained on our entire balanced dataset and then applied
to the tertiary structure data of an antigen of HIV and an antigen
of an influenza virus to make prediction of their epitopes. These
two antigens are distantly related to the antigens in our training
dataset.

4.1 Antigen GP120 of HIV-1 clade A/E 93TH057

The tertiary structure data of the antigen GP120 of HIV-1 clade
A/E 93TH057 is stored at PDB entry 3TGT. There are six

1968 (H3N2) influenza virus (4FNK). (a) B factor distribution on 4FNK:
the color pattern is shown in the color bar: the color from blue to red
represents the B factor from small to large. (b) Epitopes on 4FNK: the
epitopes are marked in magenta

protein binding (Chung et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Neuvirth
et al., 2004). However, this is the first time B factor has been used
as a feature in epitope prediction.

As can be seen from Figure 4a and Table 4, B factor is a
notable feature in distinguishing epitope residues from non-
epitope residues. The P-value of the Mann–Whitney U hypoth-
esis test on B factor is 0,
implying that there are different
distributions between epitope residues and non-epitope residues
in terms of B factor; in other words, B factor is an effect-
ive feature in epitope prediction. In addition, the smoothed
B factor along the sequence and the B factor of the nearby

residues

smoothed
B factor returns a P-value of 0, which confirms that it is
reasonable to use the sequence window in constructing new
features.

Figure 6 shows a box-plot of the B factor distribution
of epitope residues and non-epitope residues. The average
B factor of epitope residues is 39.7, while that of non-
epitope residues is 52.27: epitope residues are apt to locate
in less mobilizable areas compared with other
surface
residues.

In our training dataset, the only antigen related to HIV virus
is an HIV-1 capsid protein (2PXR). Its epitope is extracted
from 1AFV (an HIV-1 capsid protein in complex with
Fab25.3). But no significant sequence similarity is found
between 2PXR and 3TGT (the test antigen GP120) by
BLAST. In the training dataset of DiscoTope and SEPPA, how-
ever, there are antigens similar to antigen GP120. In fact,
DiscoTope’s training data contains 1RZK, 1G9M, 1G9N and
1GC1, which are four envelope glycoprotein GP120 and anti-
body complexes. In SEPPA, 2I5Y, 1G9M and 1G9N are three
envelope
complexes.
Therefore, the comparison is not favorable to CeePre, as the
performance of DiscoTope and SEPPA on 3TGT may be over-
estimated. ElliPro does not need to be trained, and thus it has no
training dataset.

4.1.1 Prediction performance comparison The prediction results
of CeePre and those of
three predictors are
reported in Table 5. CeePre achieves good prediction results,
outperforming DiscoTope and SEPPA. ElliPro has a slightly
higher recall (0.66 versus our 0.61), that is, 66% of the true epi-
tope residues are correctly predicted. However, its precision is
only 0.22, meaning that of the residues predicted as epitope resi-
dues, only 22% are true epitope residues. In other words, it tends
to predict non-epitope residues as epitope residues. As to
CeePre2, although the recall value is slightly less than ElliPro
(0.05 lower), its accuracy is significantly higher (0.51 higher).
Thus, it achieves an F-score of 0.55, which is twice as high as
that of ElliPro. Also, our MCC is much better (0.58 versus
 0.08). The comparison result can be seen more clearly in

Compared with CeePre1, CeePre2 has an impressive clustering ef-
fect on true epitope residues. Some non-epitope residue
predictions among true epitope residue predictions are also
corrected as true epitope residues by CeePre2. At the same
time, CeePre2 corrects predictions for some isolated residues
that are all predicted as antigenic residue by CeePre 1, for
example, residues at positions 47, 53, 57, 63, 68, 232, 234, 236,
247, 250, 299, 439 and 444 in chain A, which are all false-positive
predictions by CeePre1.

Our prediction models CeePre1 and CeePre2 are also applied to
the tertiary structure data (3KU3) of antigen hemagglutinin
(HA) of an influenza virus A/Japan/305/1957(H2N2). This anti-
gen has two quaternary structures in PDB: 4HF5 (A/Japan/305/
1957 in complex with Fab 8F8) and 4HLZ (A/Japan/305/1957 in
complex with a broadly neutralizing antibody C179 (Dreyfus

figure (b) mark those residues that are wrongly predicted as an isolated
epitope or a non-epitope residue by CeePre1 and are corrected by clus-
tering in CeePre2

In our training dataset, only one tertiary structure (2YPG) is
from the influenza family, and its three epitopes (extracted from
1EO8, 1QFU, 1KEN) are all annotated. The evolution distance
between the two antigens is far: 3KU3 HA belongs to group 1,
while 2YPG HA belongs to group 2. Their sequence similarity
determined by BLAST is only 36% for HA1 and 56% for HA2.
HA in group 1 is not included in the training datasets of
DiscoTope, ElliPro or SEPPA either. Thus,
this is a fair
comparison.

4.2.1 Prediction performance comparison on 3KU3 The predic-
tion results are listed in Table 6. The performance by CeePre2
excels for every metric compared with the three predictors. Its
F-score is more than twice of the best of the other three pre-
dictors. For MCC, another metric that characterizes the overall
performance of classifiers, CeePre2 far exceeds all three pre-
dictors. There is a remarkable improvement in recall, which
implies that more epitope residues are identified by CeePre2.
At the same time, the precision and specificity of CeePre2 are
also higher.

Compared with CeePre1, CeePre2 makes a significant im-
provement on recall, but shows a relatively small decrease in

specificity and precision. This means that more true epitope resi-
dues are correctly classified, but some non-epitope residues are
marked as epitope residues. Next, we will discuss the reason for
this phenomenon.

4.2.2 Some prediction details Figure 10 shows that the two
epitopes of the HA are correctly identified by CeePre. All the
antigenic residues of the epitope binding to 8F8 are correctly
predicted by CeePre2. This epitope is on HA1. Almost all of
the antigenic residues of the epitope on HA2 that binds to the
broadly neutralizing antibody C179 are correctly predicted.
A small number of edge antigenic residues (residues 38, 40, 291
on chain A and residues 42, 45, 56 on chain B) are predicted as
negative. This may be because this epitope is conserved; it has a
slightly different feature from strain-specific epitopes and may
need special strategies for epitope prediction and feature selec-
tion. As can be seen in Figure 10d–f, this conserved epitope is not
detected by the other three predictors.

CeePre2 again demonstrates the clustering effect on this anti-
gen: separated antigenic residues are aggregated into epitopes,
while isolated epitope and non-epitope residue predictions by
CeePre1 are removed by the second stage of CeePre2. The pre-
cision and specificity may decrease in this stage, especially for
those antigens whose epitopes are not completely discovered or
annotated (high FP). For example, although some antibodies
have been proved to react with the virus A/Japan/305/
1957(H2N2), for example, C05 and CR6261 (Ekiert et al.,
2012), their complex structures are not yet determined and the
epitopes are still unknown. These epitope residues cannot be
annotated here, leading to a higher FP rate.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have proposed CeePre for conformational
B-cell epitope prediction. CeePre has a two-stage learning
strategy for the random forest algorithm to identify clusters of
antigenic residues. It incorporates various basic features as well
as extended composite features through a sequence window and
a structure window. Of these features, B factor is used for the
first time for B-cell epitope prediction It has been found to be
effective in epitope prediction.

To be practically useful, a tertiary structure dataset has been
constructed for the training of our prediction method and has
also been used in the evaluation of CeePre. Compared with three
widely used structure-based epitope prediction models,
our CeePre shows a significant improvement in prediction
performance.

tope on HA2

For deep case studies, CeePre has been applied to the epitope
prediction for two antigens that are distantly related to our train-
ing data. One antigen is an HIV antigen, the other is an influenza
antigen. It has been found that CeePre not only obtains more
accurate predictions of epitope residues but also forms more
meaningful epitope predictions by clustering adjacent residues.
