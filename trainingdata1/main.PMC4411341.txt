Abstract Although molecular mechanisms of heat stroke under physiological and pathological
conditions have not yet been elucidated, a novel disease-associated gene encoding a calcium-binding
protein, calsequestrin-1 (CASQ1), was suggested relevant based on results from a transgenic murine
model. Here, we show the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CASQ1
and physiological parameters for heat stroke from a study involving 150 patients. Pooled DNA
from heat stroke patients were subjected to sequencing and 3 SNPs were identiﬁed. Genotypes were
assigned for all patients according to g. 175A>G, one SNP which leads to a nonsynonymous sub-
stitution (N59D) in the ﬁrst exon of human CASQ1 gene. We analyzed the genotypic data with a
linear model based on signiﬁcance scores between SNP (175A>G) and heat stroke parameters. As a
result, we found a signiﬁcant association between SNP A175G and heat stroke (P < 0.05). Further
bioinformatics analysis of the 1-Mb ﬂanking sequence revealed the presence of two genes that
encode DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 (DCAF8), and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19
(PEX19), respectively, which might be functionally related to CASQ1. Our results showed that
the blood calcium of patients with allele D increased signiﬁcantly, compared to patients with allele
N (P < 0.05), which may result from the decreased calcium in muscle, suggesting that N59D in
CASQ1 might account for the dysfunction of CASQ1 in calcium regulation during heat stroke.

Heat stroke is a life-threatening illness commonly found in
tropical areas and during hot seasons elsewhere. It is charac-
terized by an elevated core body temperature above 40 °C,
which induces multi-organ failures (such as circulatory shock,
central nervous system dysfunction, acute renal and liver
failures, etc.) and sometimes followed with heat cytotoxic-
ity, coagulopathies and systemic inﬂammatory response
syndrome [1]. Heat
stroke is experienced primarily by

immunocompromised individuals, such as the very young and
the elderly [2]. The inability to properly predict, diagnose and
treat long-term sequelae of heat stroke is a serious concern of
modern medicine, which reﬂects our limited understanding of
its pathophysiological mechanisms mediating tissue injuries.
Recent epidemiological studies of short- and long-term heat
stroke outcomes indicate that multiple organ dysfunctional
syndrome continues to manifest in patients following clinical
treatment and increases mortality during the ensuing months
and years of recovery [3,4]. Therefore, application of novel
technologies, including radiotelemetric, genomic and proteo-
mic analyses, in heat stroke research is of essence in advancing
our knowledge on its pathophysiology. The association
between heat stroke and calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) gene was
reported in a recent study, which represented a signiﬁcant step
forward [5]. CASQ1 can modulate skeletal muscle contraction
by regulating Ca2+ release in sarcoplasmic reticulum [6,7].
Muscle is known to act as the most important organ that pro-
duces heat for the body and is considered as heat production
pivot [5]. Previous studies have assumed that varied abilities
to tolerate torrid and humid environments among people are
attributed to the differential capacities of their muscles to
modulate production and release of heat [8–10]. Therefore,
CASQ1, which regulates the skeletal muscle movement, could
underlie the different resistance of people to heat stroke.

There are two calsequestrin genes in humans, CASQ1 and
CASQ2, residing on the two different arms of chromosome
1. Both CASQ1 and CASQ2 are Ca2+-binding proteins with
high capacity. CASQ1 isoform present in the skeletal muscles
binds around 80 Ca2+ ions, whereas CASQ2 isoform present
in the cardiac muscle binds approximately 60 Ca2+ ions.
However, these two isoforms function differentially, CASQ1
regulates the Ca2+ homeostasis while CASQ2 does not [11].
Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
found in the CASQ1 coding sequences including a rare
nonsynonymous SNP in exon 11 (A348V), albeit lack of dis-
ease association [12]. Recently, it has been indicated that heat
stroke survivors have a signiﬁcant elevation in the 30-year
mortality rate, compared to individuals who have never expe-
rienced heat stroke [13,14]. In this study, we aim to discover
sequence variations in CASQ1 gene and carry out an associa-
tion study on patients who suffered from heat stroke.

Results

Discovery of CASQ1 sequence variation and genotyping

DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 150 patients
who were diagnosed with heat stroke. Then, PCR ampliﬁca-
tion was performed with primers designed to cover different
portions of CASQ1 genomic sequence and the resulting PCR
products were sequenced. Sequencing analysis indicated that

Table 1 SNPs identiﬁed in CASQ1 from heat stroke patients

three SNPs were identiﬁed,
including one nonsynonymous
SNP in exon 1(g. 175A>G), one intronic SNP in intron 2
(g. 2968C>T) and one
synonymous SNP in exon 3
(g. 3015C>T) (Table 1 and Figure 1). Database search indi-
cated that the intronic SNP was reported in the NCBI dbSNP
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) as rs3747623, but
without any functional annotation. On the other hand, the
two exonic SNPs were not published before. In particular,
the newly-identiﬁed SNP in exon 1, g. 175A>G, leads to the
alteration of amino acid residue at codon 59 from asparagine
to aspartic acid (N59D).

Asparagine 59 is located in the alpha helix 1 of CASQ1 [15]
and substitution with the acidic amino acid residue aspartic
acid could have functional implications. To explore this possi-
bility, we then performed genotyping for all the patients. To do
this, we designed a PCR-RFLP assay using the restriction
enzyme BtsCI to digest PCR products before gel electrophore-
sis (Figure 2). The three genotypes, NN, ND and DD, were
classiﬁed according to band patterns of three fragment groups,
605 bp, 605 + 481 + 224 bp and 481 + 224 bp, respectively.

Association analysis between genotypes and heat stroke
parameters

indices indicated all

Physiological indices were commonly used clinically for heat
stroke diagnosis and served as a sign for heat stroke [16]. We
thus evaluated the biochemical data to see whether there is
any correlation with CASQ1 genotypes. The patients were
divided into three groups according to genotypes. Analysis
of critical blood physiological
indices
except platelet counts tended to increase in genotypes contain-
ing D allele; however, there were no signiﬁcant differences
between patients with NN genotype and ND genotype
(Table 2). Instead, platelet count was signiﬁcantly lower in
the DD group than that in the NN group, whereas an opposite
trend is observed for blood calcium. In addition, both leuko-
cyte and creatinine were signiﬁcantly high in DD groups, com-
pared to both NN and ND groups (P < 0.05). No signiﬁcant
alteration in urea nitrogen was observed.

Next, we used a general linear model to assess the signiﬁ-
cance of the association between genotypes and demographic
data such as age, gender, smoking, drinking, family history
of heat stroke and weight index. Our results showed that
age, gender, smoking and drinking did not differ signiﬁcantly
between the genotypes (P > 0.05). However, signiﬁcantly
more patients with genotype DD had a family history of heat
stroke, compared to those with genotypes NN or ND
(P < 0.05) (Table 3). Furthermore, recurrence of heat stroke
was signiﬁcantly high in patients with S allele. These data sug-
gest that there is no signiﬁcant correlation between heat stroke
and age, gender, smoking or drinking, whereas family history
of heat stroke may indicate a higher risk of heat stroke

Functional analysis of related genes found
in the mutation-residing locus

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis is often served as a post-
genome-wide association study (GWAS) method in genetic
research, and LD generally triggers the reduction of polymor-
phism in locus around the causative SNP, in selective theory,
which is called as a selective sweep [17]. To explore the linkage
disequilibrium effect between different genes and to identify
the functional genes physically around the mutation-residing
locus, we used BioMart
(http://www.biomart.org/) and
DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), two common bioin-
formatic software tools, for functional analysis to evaluate
genes in the 1-Mb ﬂanking sequences of the mutation-residing
locus with 0.5 Mb on each side. BioMart helps to ﬁnd
homologous genes in the target region, and DAVID could
cluster all the genes into pathways or systematic biological
functions. The ﬁrst two genes standing out are those encoding

DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 (DCAF8) and peroxi-
somal biogenesis factor 19 (PEX19). As far as we know, the
functional association between CASQ1 and DCAF8 or
PEX19 has not been reported.

Discussion

Heat stroke usually occurs in tropic regions or during hot cli-
mate and heat is often attributed as the causative factor
[18,19]. Additionally, genetic susceptibility has also been
reported for heat stroke [20,21], indicating the involvement
of genetic background in heat stroke. Based on high through-
put data as well as a limited number of association studies,
recent studies have indicated CASQ1 as a candidate gene asso-
ciated with heat stroke [22–25]. In this study, we discovered a
novel CASQ1 SNP, which causes a nonsynonymous amino
acid substitution N59D.

Our association analysis on demographic and clinical data
indicated that family history is signiﬁcantly associated with
heat stroke occurrence for patients with DD genotype, i.e.,
patients whose family or relatives have previously suffered

from heat stroke are more likely to possess DD genotype
(P < 0.05). Moreover,
the heat stroke recurrence in the
patients with allele D is also remarkably higher than those with
allele N (NN) (P < 0.01), suggesting that allele D increases the
possibility of heat stroke recurrence. However, a few recent
reports argued that CASQ1 is associated with diabetes mellitus
but not heat stroke [12], when investigating elderly people in
North America, who are in an extreme pathological condition
and more vulnerable to heat stroke [26–28], which might com-
plicate data interpretation. In contrast, patients in our current
study were relatively young (below 40 years old on average)
and they did not have other major diseases. In addition,
patients recruited in their and our studies were of different eth-
nic backgrounds, thus we could not rule out the possible effect
of ethnicity. A larger cohort involving more heat stroke
patients, followed by functional studies of the CASQ1 protein
with N59D, would be essential to address the discrepancy.

Blood physiological indices, which are usually considered
as initial indicators for the health status of patients, have been
used to group patients for heat stroke studies on CASQ1 muta-
tions. Altered blood physiological indices, especially increase
in leukocyte count and decrease in platelet count, were
observed in people with heat stroke in relation to healthy con-
trols. Therefore, alterations in these blood physiological indi-
ces often serve as the early response of heat stroke [16,29,30].
Similar observations were also revealed in our study. Further-
more, our results indicated that signiﬁcantly higher leukocyte
count and lower platelet count were found in the blood from
patients with genotype DD. In addition, no signiﬁcant alter-
ation in amount of blood urea nitrogen was detected among
different patients, whereas creatinine in patients with DD phe-
notype was signiﬁcantly increased. Blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine are critical indices of renal function in the human
[31]. However, it is possible that the increase of creatinine in

blood could result from increased metabolic rate in muscle,
since patients with heat stroke may endure a severe physical
activity. Interestingly, signiﬁcantly higher amount of Ca2+
was found in the blood from patients with genotype DD as
well. Bouchama et al previously reported that patients with
heat stroke had increased amount of Ca2+ [28]. Since CASQ1
is known as the major Ca2+-binding protein in the skeletal
muscle, we speculate that N59D might reduce the calcium
binding ability of CASQ1 in skeletal muscle at high tempera-
ture, which may lead to increased calcium in blood when
patients suffered from heat stroke. Further investigation would
be necessary to test this hypothesis.

Our clinical practice indicated that the recurrence rate of
heat stroke was 6% on average for patients. Moreover, the fre-
quency and severity of recurrence in patients also differed;
some patients suffered from recurrence often and showed
worsened immunity with recurrence. Our study indicated that
patients carrying allele D had a higher recurrence rate than the
average, suggesting that they were more vulnerable to heat
stroke. Further investigation of differential recurrence among
patients could provide some insights into the mechanisms
underlying heat stroke.

Finally, in the region ﬂanking the nonsynonymous SNP, we
found two genes DCAF8 and PEX19 that might be related to
the pathogenesis of heat stroke. DCAF8 and PEX19 are
known to mediate the body repairing system and work as
the important component in the binding of substrates to the
Cul4-Ddb1 E3 ligase macromolecular complex and ubiquitina-
tion [32–35]. DDB1 is a large subunit of the heterodimeric
DNA DDB complex. It was reported that defective activity
of this complex causes repair defect in patients with xeroderma
pigmentosum (XP), an autosomal recessive disorder character-
ized by photosensitivity and early onset of carcinomas [15,36].
Additionally, PEX19 is necessary for early peroxisomal

biogenesis and plays important roles in many biological path-
ways such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family protein-med-
iated transport and organism-speciﬁc biosystem [37]. The
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (UPP) is a common mecha-
nism to degrade endogenous proteins. Furthermore, ubiquiti-
nation is indispensible in regulating biological functions of a
vast number of proteins [35]. Further investigation in the func-
tional interaction between CASQ1 and DCAF8, PEX19 would
be required to test this possibility.

In summary, we identiﬁed a new nonsynonymous SNP
(N59D) in CASQ1 from heat stroke patients. Analyses of clin-
ical data indicated that there were signiﬁcant differences
between NN and DD genotypes in recurrence of heat stroke,
familiar history of occurrence and some blood physiological
indices in heat stroke patients. Investigation of the molecular
detail of the CASQ1 N59D variation is of importance to eluci-
date the roles of CASQ1 in heat stroke.

Materials and methods

Patients

A retrospective study was performed for patients who were
diagnosed with heat stroke and admitted to the PLA hospital
or Beijing Electric Power Hospital between 2007 and 2010.
Patients with other diseases, such as cancer, liver and renal
inﬂammation, or central nervous system disorders, that may
complicate the data interpretation were excluded. After exclu-
sion, in total 150 patients who suffered or died from heat
stroke were recruited in this study, including 83 males and
67 females aged 18–41 years old. All these patients had no kin-
ship or genetic relationship with each other. Heat stroke was
diagnosed by the body temperature above 40 °C and apsychia
after strenuous exercise. The Hospital Ethics Committee
approved this study and written informed consents were
acquired from all the patients.

(Table S1). The resulting PCR products were separated on
agarose gel and puriﬁed using UltraCleanÒ Tissue DNA Iso-
lation Kit. Puriﬁed DNA was then digested with BstU I
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, US) and the resulting
bands were resolved on 1% agarose gel.

Statistical method

Chi-square test was performed to evaluate the relationship
between the blood physiological
index of the heat stroke
patients and their genotypes. Especially, the recurrence of heat
stroke among patients was investigated based on a linear
model. All statistical procedures were calculated by using
SAS 9.0. The signiﬁcance threshold is set to a P value of 0.05.

Bioinformatics analysis

BioMart (http://www.biomart.org/) and DAVID 6.7 were used
to detect potential genes located 0.5 Mb upstream and down-
stream of the SNP position or the locus (the total region is
1 Mb). All genes in the deﬁned region were annotated based
on information from the NCBI database. We selected the
mouse as the homologous species to humans due to the wider
coverage of the annotated genes.

Sample collection and DNA extraction

Acknowledgements

Blood samples were collected from 150 heat stroke patients.
The procedure was approved by the institutional
internal
review board and informed consents were signed before sample
collection. Blood samples were collected into ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid dipotassium salt (EDTA-K2) anticoagulant
tubes, stored at  20 °C and used within a week. DNA was
extracted using the Tiangen DNA extraction kit (Beijing Tian-
gen Biotechnology, Beijing, China) as instructed by the manu-
facturer and stored frozen at  20 °C (ﬁnal concentrations of
60–90 ng/ll).

SNP discovery

We designed 6 pairs of PCR primers using Primer 5.0 to
amplify all 11 exons of CASQ1 (Table S1). Equal amount of
PCR products from all patients using the same primers were
pooled together before sequencing. Sequencing was performed
by Beijing Sunbiotech to detect potential SNPs.

We employed the PCR-restriction fragment length poly-
morphism (RFLP) assay for genotyping [38]. Brieﬂy, CASQ1
Exon 1 was ampliﬁed using primers designed for exon1
