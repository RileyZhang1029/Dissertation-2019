Abstract Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparations are widely used for healthcare and
clinical practice. So far, the methods commonly used for quality evaluation of TCM preparations
mainly focused on chemical ingredients. The biological ingredient analysis of TCM preparations is
also important because TCM preparations usually contain both plant and animal ingredients,
which often include some mis-identiﬁed herbal materials, adulterants or even some biological con-
taminants. For biological ingredient analysis, the efﬁciency of DNA extraction is an important fac-
tor which might affect the accuracy and reliability of identiﬁcation. The component complexity in
TCM preparations is high, and DNA might be destroyed or degraded in different degrees after a
series of processing procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an effective protocol for
DNA extraction from TCM preparations. In this study, we chose a classical TCM preparation,
Liuwei Dihuang Wan (LDW), as an example to develop a TCM-speciﬁc DNA extraction method.
An optimized cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method (TCM-CTAB) and three com-
monly-used extraction kits were tested for extraction of DNA from LDW samples. Experimental
results indicated that DNA with the highest purity and concentration was obtained by using
TCM-CTAB. To further evaluate the different extraction methods, ampliﬁcation of the second
internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and the chloroplast genome trnL intron was carried out.

The results have shown that PCR ampliﬁcation was successful only with template of DNA
extracted by using TCM-CTAB. Moreover, we performed high-throughput 454 sequencing using
DNA extracted by TCM-CTAB. Data analysis showed that 3–4 out of 6 prescribed species were
detected from LDW samples, while up to 5 contaminating species were detected, suggesting
TCM-CTAB method could facilitate follow-up DNA-based examination of TCM preparations.

Introduction

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparations are widely
used for healthcare and clinical practice in China and many
other Asian countries. They are usually made from medicinal
plants, animal materials and minerals, containing hundreds
of compounds [1,2]. So far, the commonly used methods for
quality evaluation of TCM preparations have mainly focused
on chemical ingredient analysis by various chromatographic
and spectroscopic methods [3,4]. However, these targeted
approaches can only measure the chemicals of interest, but
often fail to identify the contaminating biological ingredients.
Mis-identiﬁed herbal materials, adulterants or even some bio-
logical contaminants could be potentially included during the
complex collection and manufacture procedures. Therefore,
in addition to the analysis of chemical ingredients, the analysis
of biological
is also
important.

in TCM preparations

ingredients

In recent years, DNA ﬁngerprinting and sequencing tech-
nologies have been applied to the ﬁeld of TCM quality evalu-
ation [5–7]. Some studies on molecular authentication of TCM
preparations have been reported recently [8–10]. In combina-
tion with the sensitive high-throughput sequencing (HTS) tech-
nology [11], all biological constituents, even those with trace
amount, in TCM preparations could be potentially identiﬁed,
including both prescribed and contaminating species [12].
DNA of different ingredients present in the preparations could
be ampliﬁed and sequenced, whose abundance would be pro-
portionally represented within the ﬁnal DNA extract [13].
Therefore, the efﬁciency of DNA extraction is critical, which
might affect
ingredient
identiﬁcation.

the accuracy and reliability of

The sequencing-based method has been used in a number of
herb identiﬁcation instances, and methods for extracting DNA
from fresh plants have been intensively investigated [14–17].
However, there is still lack of studies exploring efﬁcient proto-
cols for DNA extraction from TCM preparations. On the one
hand, compared to fresh herbal plants, TCM preparations are
composed of various decoction pieces and some excipients,
thus extraction methods with universal applicability would
be desired. On the other hand, after a series of processing pro-
cedures such as drying and stewing, DNA would be destroyed
or degraded to different extents. Therefore, an improved DNA
extraction method should be developed to extract DNA with
high sensitivities and accuracies for the identiﬁcation of both
prescribed and contaminating species in TCM preparations.
As a result, the following ampliﬁcation, sequencing and data
analysis could reliably reﬂect the biological
ingredients in
TCM preparations.

In this study, we chose a classical TCM preparation, Liuwei
Dihuang Wan (LDW), as an example in order to develop a
TCM-speciﬁc DNA extraction method. LDW comprises six
traditional herbs including Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch.,
Cornus ofﬁcinalis Sieb. et Zucc., Paeonia suffruticosa Andr.,

Dioscorea opposita Thunb., Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf and
Alisma orientalis (Sam.) Juzep. Among them, R. glutinosa and
C. ofﬁcinalis are steam processed while the others are raw mate-
rials. All herbal materials are crushed to powder, mixed and
made into pills together with honey or water. With each of its
components having distinct properties (processed vs. unpro-
cessed, plant vs. fungi), LDW could serve as a representative
TCM preparation for the assessment of DNA extraction method.

Results and discussion

Assessment of DNA extraction methods for LDW samples

We used LDW purchased in Qingdao, China (QD) and Singa-
pore (SG), respectively, as examples for DNA extraction and
selected four DNA extraction methods for performance com-
parison. These included three commonly-used commercial
DNA extraction kits: OMEGA E.Z.N.A. HP Plant DNA
Kit (OMEGA Kit), MOBIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit
(MOBIO Kit) and Chinese Herbal Medicine Kit (Henan Huier
Nano Technology, Huier Kit), as well as our newly-developed
TCM-cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method.
OMEGA Kit is designed for fresh, dry or frozen specimen;
MOBIO Kit is used for environmental samples; whereas Huier
Kit is a universal extraction kit for Chinese medicinal materi-
als. The TCM-CTAB method was reported for the ﬁrst time in
this work. TCM-CTAB was optimized from the CTAB
method [18], which is a manual method widely used for
DNA extraction from different types of samples. We combined
the CTAB method with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) method
[19] to remove polysaccharides effectively [20]. In addition, the
lysis duration was prolonged to increase DNA yield, whereas
phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol extraction was performed
twice to remove any possible remaining proteins and chloro-
form–isoamyl alcohol extraction was performed to remove
residual phenol

ampliﬁcation.

The yield and quality of DNA extracted were determined
spectrometrically. It was shown that the purity of DNA
extracted by the TCM-CTAB method was high for both QD
and SG samples, with an A260/A280 ratio in the optimal range
(1.6–1.8)
ratio of DNA
extracted by OMEGA, MOBIO and Huier kits was lower than
1.6, suggesting possible contaminants like polysaccharides,
polyphenols, etc. In addition, different DNA yield was
achieved when using four extraction protocols. With the
TCM-CTAB method, the DNA concentrations of samples
QD and SG were 589.0 ± 61.2 and 691.0 ± 54.2 ng/lL,
respectively, whereas the extraction rates were 70.7 ± 7.3
and 82.9 ± 6.3 lg/g, respectively. Compared to the results of
the other three kits (Table 1), it was obvious that the best per-
formance in terms of both DNA concentration and extraction
rate was achieved using TCM-CTAB. Furthermore, gel

electrophoresis analysis (Figure 1) showed that obvious bands
were only detected for DNA extracted using TCM-CTAB and
Huier Kit. Moreover, the band intensity of DNA extracted
using TCM-CTAB was higher than that using Huier Kit,
although both exhibited dispersal pattern. All these data indi-
cated that the highest extraction efﬁciency and quality of DNA
were obtained using the TCM-CTAB method. Commercial
DNA extraction kits usually have deﬁned reagents and proto-
cols, making them difﬁcult to modify according to the speciﬁc
requirements of varied TCM preparations. On the contrary,
when using the TCM-CTAB method, we can easily change
the concentration and composition of extraction buffer. On
top of that, the TCM-CTAB method is also cost effective,
compared to other DNA extraction kits tested in this study.

There were many successful trials of genome extraction for
fresh herbs, but few studies were reported for TCM prepara-
tions. While some ingredients in TCM preparations might
remain unprocessed before mixing with others (such as P. suf-
fruticosa in LDW), some other plant or animal tissues in TCM
preparations (such as R. glutinosa in LDW) might be com-
pletely or partially destroyed during the processing procedures,
which would lead to degraded genomes in various degrees. As
a result, the amount and quality of DNA retained in TCM
preparations would be much lower than those in the fresh

plants. Therefore, thorough lysis of TCM preparations to
enrich DNA with high quality is very important. In addition,
the complex components in TCM preparations,
including
many kinds of secondary metabolites such as phenolics and
polysaccharides, might have negative effects on DNA puriﬁca-
tion [22,23]. Besides, different excipients were also used in
TCM preparations. All these factors would reduce DNA pur-
ity, which might affect
the following ampliﬁcation and
sequencing.

DNA ampliﬁcation of LDW samples

Since serious DNA degradation was observed with gel electro-
phoresis, PCR ampliﬁcation of the second internal transcribed
spacer (ITS2) [24] and the chloroplast genome trnL (intron)
with universal primers [25] was performed to evaluate the
integrity of the extracted DNA samples. ITS2 (500 bp) has
been used as a standard molecular marker to identify medici-
nal plants for its high inter-speciﬁc and intra-speciﬁc discrimi-
nation power [26,27] while trnL (p-loop) (200 bp) is a short
fragment that can be easily ampliﬁed in heavily degraded
DNA samples [28]. Therefore, ITS2 and trnL were chosen as
the biomarkers for species discrimination of LDW. PCR with-
out DNA template was served as a negative control. As shown
in Figure 2, no band was revealed in the negative control, indi-
cating no contamination from environment and reagents. Fur-
thermore, when DNA extracted with the TCM-CTAB method
was used as template, strong bands for ITS2 and trnL were

observed at 500 bp (Figure 2) and 200 bp for both the QD and
SG samples. Using ITS2 as the biomarker, a weak band was
detected with DNA extracted by Huier Kit as the template
for QD samples but not for SG samples, whereas no bands
were detected for any samples when using DNA isolated by
OMEGA or MOBIO Kit as the template. Therefore, DNA
extracted using the TCM-CTAB method was readily ampliﬁed
compared to the other three kits. Given the highest quality and
concentration of DNA recovered, as well as the satisfactory
PCR results, the TCM-CTAB method was the most effective
method for the DNA isolation of LDW among the four
DNA extraction methods tested. We thus chose TCM-CTAB
for the following sequencing experiments.

High-throughput sequencing of LDW samples

The ITS2 and trnL ampliﬁcation products were further sub-
jected to high-throughput sequencing, so as to examine the
actual biological
ingredients of LDW samples. The high-
throughput sequencing was performed by a 454 GS-Titanium
sequencer with default setting, and an analysis of sequencing
data was carried out for both QD and SG samples. After strin-
gent ﬁltering process for quality control (see Materials and
methods), we obtained 4151 ITS2 and 2677 trnL reads (1384
ITS2 reads and 892 trnL reads per sample on average) for
QD samples, while 7162 ITS2 and 1665 trnL reads were
obtained for SG samples (2387 ITS2 reads and 555 trnL reads
per sample on average) (Table 2). The length of ITS2 and trnL
sequencing reads from QD samples varied from 151 bp to
493 bp (354 bp on average) and 75 bp to 208 bp (126 bp on
average). Similar results were also obtained for SG samples.
The read length was 150–502 bp (352 bp on average) for
ITS2 and 75–211 bp (125 bp on average) for trnL (Table S1).
The length distribution of the sequencing reads for all LDW
samples was shown in Figure 3. Some variations were observed
between samples for both ITS2 and trnL groups. As we pri-
marily focused on the evaluation of DNA extraction methods
for TCM preparations in this study, the details of biological
and technical effects would be scrutinized in the future.

Sequencing reads were searched against the NCBI database
by BLAST for species identiﬁcation. As listed in Table 3 for
ITS2 and Table 4 for trnL, P. suffruticosa, D. opposite and
A. orientalis were detected from both QD and SG samples
by both biomarkers, while C. ofﬁcinalis (by trnL) and R. glutin-
osa (by ITS2 and trnL) were only detected in SG samples. We
failed to identify P. cocos from any samples by either ITS2 or
trnL. Failure to identify P. cocos using trnL can be easily
explained by the fact that as a fungus, P. cocos does not pos-
sess chloroplast. However it is surprising that P. cocos was not
detected using ITS2. We suspected that the universal ITS2
primers may not work for P. cocos. To test this possibility,
multiple sequence alignment was performed for ITS2 reference
sequences (from NCBI) for all 6 species in LDW around the

that ITS2 S2F primer sequence was identical to the sequences
of ITS2 from 5 plant species but not P. cocos. 4-bp mismatch
existed between the primer sequence and the corresponding
ITS2 sequence of P. cocos (Figure S1), which may underlie
the failure to identify P. cocos by using universal ITS2 primers.
Instead, our ongoing efforts indicated that P. cocos can be
detected with a primer set speciﬁcally designed according to
the P. cocos ITS2 sequences (unpublished data). These data
suggested that ITS2 universal primers have limited applicabil-
ity and caution should be taken when using these primers for
the identiﬁcation of some species. Moreover, R. glutinosa
and C. ofﬁcinalis were only identiﬁed from one SG sample.
R. glutinosa and C. ofﬁcinalis in LDW samples are processed
by steaming and stewing, and these harsh processing proce-
dures might lead to severe DNA degradation or loss. In addi-
tion, it is also possible that there might be differences between

SG and QD samples in the source of medicinal plants or pro-
cessing procedures. Without a clearly-deﬁned standard for the
processing procedures, DNA preservation from herbal materi-
als and TCM preparations would be varied, which may lead to
variations in detection.

Other than the prescribed species, 5 other plant genera
including Persicaria, Rumex, Vigna, Saposhnikovia and Tarax-
acum were detected from SG samples, suggesting possible bio-
logical contaminations. We speculated that these plant species
might be incorporated unintentionally during collection, pro-
cessing or manufacturing steps. Biological contaminations
would lower the efﬁcacy of the TCM preparations or might
cause adverse effects. Therefore, strict manufacturing process
would be of great
importance for the safety of TCM
preparations.

LDW samples. By using the TCM-CTAB method, the DNA
was recovered with desirable yield and purity. Then by means
of PCR ampliﬁcation and high-throughput sequencing tech-
nology, 4 prescribed species and 5 contaminating species were
identiﬁed from LDW samples based on the ITS2 sequencing
analysis, and 5 prescribed species were identiﬁed based on
the trnL sequencing analysis. Therefore, the TCM-CTAB
method can serve as an efﬁcient DNA extraction procedure
to achieve relatively complete identiﬁcation of biological ingre-
dients in TCM preparations.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we tested four different DNA extraction meth-
ods for LDW samples and indicated that our newly-developed
DNA extraction protocol TCM-CTAB can be used to extract
DNA efﬁciently for the following detection of both prescribed
and potential contaminating biological species in TCM prepa-
rations. Compared to three commonly-used DNA extraction
kits (OMEGA Kit, MOBIO Kit and Huier Kit), the TCM-
CTAB method can work more competently when tested on

of LDW were collected, with one purchased in Qingdao, China
(QD) in April 2012 and the other purchased in Singapore (SG)
in June 2012.

DNA extraction and quantiﬁcation

We extracted DNA from the two LDW samples (each with
three replicates) using four protocols, including TCM-CTAB
and three
commercial DNA extraction kits, OMEGA

USA), MOBIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO, San
Diego, USA) and Chinese Herbal Medicine Kit (Henan Huier
Nano Technology, Henan, China). DNA was extracted from
50–250 mg LDW per sample as instructed by the manufactur-
ers except TCM-CTAB and the resulting DNA was dissolved
in 30 lL TE buffer.

The TCM-CTAB method is an optimized CTAB method
specialized for the extraction of DNA from biological ingredi-
ents of TCM samples. The procedures of the TCM-CTAB
method were described as follows. Each sample (2.5 g) was
homogenized with 5 mL buffer containing 0.1 M Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0) and 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) with mortar and pestle.
Afterward, 1 mL of the homogenate was transferred into
50 mL tubes and diluted with 4 mL of CTAB extraction buffer
containing 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM EDTA (pH
8.0), 2% CTAB and 1.4 M NaCl, supplemented with 500 lL
10% SDS, 10 lL proteinase K (10 mg/mL) and 100 lL
b-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated at 65 °C for
3 h with occasional vortexing. Polysaccharides and proteins
were removed by extracting twice with phenol:chloroform:iso-
amyl-alcohol (25:24:1) and the residue phenol was removed by
extracting once using chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). The
supernatant was then incubated at  20 °C with 0.6-fold of
cold isopropanol for 1 h and then centrifuged at 12,500 rpm
for 10 min. The resulting precipitate was rinsed with 1 mL
70% ethanol twice and then dissolved in 30 lL TE buffer.

2 lL of each DNA sample obtained with the four afore-
mentioned methods was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel
and their concentration was quantiﬁed using NanoVue UV
visible spectrophotometer.

for which the possible corresponding species is evidenced by 3
or less reads, in order to avoid random sequence alignment
bias.
Afterward, BLASTN [31] searches were performed (E value
cutoff: 10 10) for all query sequences against the NCBI data-
base for identiﬁcation. According to the BLASTN results,
the majority of the top hits (96.57% of the matches for ITS2
reads and 97.01% of the matches for trnL reads) showed high
identity (>98%) with the reference databases. Thus, we
believe that top hits of BLASTN were adequate for identiﬁca-
tion of query sequences.

The 454 sequencing data for 6 LDW samples were depos-
ited to NCBI SRA database with accession number
SRR1049940.

PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing of ITS2/trnL

Acknowledgments

Standard PCR ampliﬁcation was performed with 50–200 ng
DNA as template and the following primers (Sangon). The
primers are S2F (50-ATG CGA TAC TTG GTG TGA AT-
30) and S3R (50-GAC GCT TCT CCA GAC TAC AAT-30)
with 7 bp multiplex identiﬁer (MID) tags for ITS2 [24], and
trnL c (50-CGA AAT CGG TAG ACG CTA CG-30) and trnL
h (50-CCA TTG AGT CTC TGC ACC TAT C-30) with 7 bp
MID tags for trnL [25]. The PCR products were electrophore-
sed on 2% agarose gel and puriﬁed with QIAquick Gel Extrac-
tion kit (QIAGEN). ITS2 and trnL amplicons were sequenced
by a Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencer with default
parameters (XLR70 sequence kit, 2 · 200 cycles).

Sequencing data analysis

There were totally 25,137 ITS2 and 20,661 trnL raw sequenc-
ing reads obtained (Table S2) and a relatively strict quality
control process was applied in order to eliminate false negative
data as much as possible. We used Mothur software package
[29,30] to discard sequencing reads that were shorter than
150 bp in ITS2 dataset and 75 bp in trnL datasets. Sequences
with an average quality score <20 in each 5-bp window rolling
along the whole read were also discarded. Moreover, the
sequencing reads containing primer mismatches, uncorrectable
barcodes, ambiguous bases, or homopolymer runs in excess of
8 bp were also removed from both datasets. We also ﬁltered
the trnL sequences for which the possible corresponding spe-
cies is evidenced (matched) by only 1 read, and ITS2 sequences
