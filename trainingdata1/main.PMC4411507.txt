Abstract Publicly-accessible resources have promoted the advance of scientiﬁc discovery. The era
of genomics and big data has brought the need for collaboration and data sharing in order to make
effective use of this new knowledge. Here, we describe the web resources for cancer genomics
research and rate them on the basis of the diversity of cancer types, sample size, omics data com-
prehensiveness, and user experience. The resources reviewed include data repository and analysis
tools; and we hope such introduction will promote the awareness and facilitate the usage of these
resources in the cancer research community.

Introduction

There has been accumulating evidence over the last two to
three decades supporting that cancer is a disease of the gen-
ome. Previous studies have followed a one-by-one approach
to examine the molecular mechanisms of cancer, although this
approach is one-sided and inefﬁcient. With the development of
high-throughput sequencing technologies, recent years have
witnessed a great data explosion and systematic study of the
cancer genome. For the ﬁrst time, data were made available
for the complete genome sequences including point mutations
and structural alternations for a large number of cancer types,
enabling the differentiation of cancer subtypes in an unprece-
dented global view. However, the effective use of the massive

amounts of cancer genome data remains a challenge due to the
limitations of computational methodologies and insufﬁcient
collaboration and sharing (Figure 1). In this paper, we describe
several popular and effective web-based cancer genomics data
repositories, along with tools and resources (Table 1) to man-
age and analyze these data. We have rated the resources based
on data comprehensiveness and ease-of-use according to our
own experience.

Cancer Genomics Hub

The Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub) is a central repository
for the genomic information generated through three different
programs at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the
United States, namely, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and the
Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective
Treatments (TARGET) projects [1]. CGHub is hosted at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), with controlled
data access to ensure patient privacy. CGHub holds nearly
1.9 PB of data, covering 42 cancer types and normal controls
(https://cghub.ucsc.edu/summary_stats.html). Till Dec 2014,
there have been more than 10,000 samples from TCGA alone
(https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp) and more
than 500 papers have been published by researchers from the
TCGA Research Network and those who used TCGA data
in their work (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/publications).
The launch of CGHub will promote the sharing of cancer data,
collaboration between cancer researchers, and potentially
facilitate the personalized medicine.

Figure 1 The future of cancer research
In the era of big data, one of the major challenges is to make full
use of multi-dimensional data from heterogeneous
sources,
including different omics data and a variety of medical data from
bedside. The success in the battle against cancer will
largely
depend on population-sized information from both genomic and
clinical resources, advanced algorithms for data mining, open and
sharing circumstances.

European Genome-phenome Archive

The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) is a data cen-
ter for all types of sequencing and genotyping experiments.
Almost 58% of all studies in EGA are related to cancer,
including data generated by the
International Cancer
Genome Consortium (ICGC). Since its founding in 2008,
ICGC has produced terabytes of data from about 12,232
donors and 50 cancer projects (https://dcc.icgc.org/repos-
itory/release_17). Somatic variant data are openly accessible
at the ICGC Data Portal (https://dcc.icgc.org/repository),
whereas raw sequence data, germline mutations, and clinical
data are held at EGA with controlled access.

Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer

The Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) is
the largest database of somatic mutations and their effects on
human cancer [2]. The database is curated manually from pub-
lished literature, allowing very precise deﬁnitions of disease
types and patient details. The database is updated every
2 months and has thus far integrated 15,047 whole cancer gen-
omes from 1,058,292 samples,
including 2,710,499 coding
mutations, 10,567 gene fusions, 61,232 genomic rearrange-
ments, 702,652 copy number variations
(CNVs), and
118,886,698 abnormal expression variants. Data can be quer-
ied by key words and downloaded by registered users.
COSMIC has also stored curated,
large-scale systematic
screens and whole-genome shotgun sequencing papers for
reference. The huge, manually-curated, and regularly-updated
dataset of the COSMIC database makes it an invaluable
resource for cancer studies.

Cancer Program Resource Gateway

The Broad Institute is one of the most famous academic cen-
ters for cancer study. Its Cancer Program aims to investigate
the fundamental mechanisms of cancer and research from dis-
covery to clinical applications. The Program releases many
datasets and tools for scientiﬁc research, which are held
at the Broad Cancer Program Resource Gateway (CPRG).
We will describe Broad’s Genome Data Analysis Center
(GDAC), one of these resources, as an example.

Broad’s GDAC

It is important but generally time-consuming or sometimes
even impossible for most labs to analyze terabytes of sequence
data. However, the Firehose system from Broad’s GDAC is
changing the status quo. The GDAC systematically analyzes
data from TCGA pilot and extends to other diseases as well.
Firehose now assembles 40 terabytes of TCGA data and reli-
ably executes more than 6000 pipelines per month. GDAC
obtains and processes the TCGA data every 2 weeks, and
makes them available afterward [3]. Firehose contains series
of standardized pipelines for genomic analysis and the comput-
ing environment is accessible to the public so that people can
install and run their own tools for data analysis. Taking
advantage of the powerful computational environment at

SNP500Cancer

The SNP500Cancer database, a part of the Cancer Genome
Anatomy Project (CGAP) (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Tools), is a
repository for sequence and genotype veriﬁcation of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer and other complex
diseases [4]. The main aim of the SNP500Cancer project is to
re-sequence reference samples to ﬁnd known or novel SNPs
for molecular epidemiology studies in cancer. The database
provides sequence information for anonymized control DNA
samples and can be queried by gene, gene ontology pathway,
chromosome,
or
SNP500Cancer SNP ID. SNP500Cancer is an insightful
resource for researchers to select SNPs for further analysis due
to its high conﬁdence, nonetheless its data volume is limited.

canEvolve

With the rapid development of biological technologies, gen-
ome-wide tumor proﬁling has grown drastically in scale and
availability. canEvolve fulﬁlls the need for data integration
and interpretation. canEvolve contains integrated data from
90 studies involving more than 10,000 patients. Data analysis
can be performed at different levels: (1) primary analysis like
mRNA, microRNA (miRNA) and protein expression, genome
variations and protein–protein interactions; (2) integrative
analysis of gene and miRNA expression, gene expression and
CNVs, and gene set enrichment analysis; (3) network analysis;
and (4) survival analysis. All the aforementioned data can be
queried and visualized in table or graph format. canEvolve is
a comprehensive functional genomics platform and is fully
accessible to the public [5].

MethyCancer

instability, and tumor

DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the development of
cancer and is associated with oncogene activation, chromo-
somal
suppressor gene silencing.
MethyCancer is designed to interpret the relationship between
DNA methylation, gene expression, and cancer. MethyCancer
houses data on (1) DNA methylation, (2) CNV and cancer
information, (3) CpG Island clones, and (4) the correlations
between these datasets. The database can be easily searched
with the user-friendly MethyView display [6].

SomamiR

miRNA sequence variation is contributable to a variety of can-
cers. SomamiR is a database created to investigate the associa-
tion of somatic and germline mutations with miRNA function
in cancer. The mutation data are collected from the Gene
Expression Omnibus
(GEO) and the Pediatric Cancer
Genome Project (PCGP), whereas the miRNA data are from
miRBase release 18. There are many ways
to search
SomamiR for somatic mutations that affect miRNA target

sites, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in cancer, can-
didate gene associations in cancer, KEGG pathways, and
mutation information in a genome browser. SomamiR also
contains a set of experimentally-validated somatic and germ-
line mutations that disrupt miRNA function associated with
cancer. The integration of mutation data in SomamiR will
enable scientists to more accurately predict whether mutations
would affect miRNA binding and consequently functional
regulation [7].

cBioPortal

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is an accessible portal for
researchers to explore, visualize, and analyze multidimensional
cancer genomics data [8]. The portal contains datasets from
many published cancer studies including CCLE and TCGA.
It is worthy of note that cBioPortal processes original molecu-
lar proﬁling data from cancer tissues and cell lines into smaller
datasets. Researchers can interactively explore patterns of
genetic alterations across samples in a single study, compare
gene alteration frequencies across multiple studies, or summar-
ize all relevant genomic variations in an individual tumor sam-
ple through the cBioPortal web query interface. It also
supports biological pathway exploration, survival analysis,
and data downloading service.

UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser

The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is an online analysis
tool for hosting, visualizing, and analyzing information on
cancer genomics and clinical research [9]. The browser pro-
vides users with measurements from a single experiment and
the associated clinical
information for multiple samples.
Furthermore, two or more datasets can be viewed at the same
time to allow comparisons of gene expression and CNV across
different data and cancer types. Data downloading and clinical
heatmap are also supported. The browser currently contains
genome-wide experiments on 71,870 samples, most of which
are from large-scale international cancer projects including
TCGA, CCLE, and the Stand Up To Cancer initiative.

Cancer Genome Work Bench

The Cancer Genome Work Bench (CGWB) is an effective tool
with a focus on gene expression and mutations, CNV, and
methylation [10]. It provides an automated analysis pipeline
for users to visualize and analyze genomic information and
gene expression variations in each sample. There are two main
viewers in CGWB––Heatmap viewer and Genome browser,
both of which can present user-speciﬁed information such as
gene expression, somatic mutations and pathway context that
the mutations may be involved in, and users can toggle
between these two viewers. It’s of note that CGWB has kept
clinical data and individual genotypes private and permission
is needed for access to these data.

Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer

The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database
is the largest open knowledgebase of drug sensitivity and drug

response in cancer cells [11]. The GDSC project includes
experiments describing the response to almost 200 anticancer
therapeutics in more than 1000 cancer cell lines. The cell line
drug sensitivity data were integrated with large genomic data-
sets in the COSMIC database to identify molecular markers of
cancer drug response. In the GDSC website, drug sensitivity
can be queried by cancer gene, cancer cell line, and compound.
Data retrieved are presented in a variety of graphical represen-
tations for view and downloading. The large collection of cell
lines, drug sensitivity, and genomic datasets have enhanced our
understanding of cancer cell genomic heterogeneity and facili-
tated the discovery of new patient-speciﬁc treatments.

canSAR

canSAR is an open cancer-centered cross-discipline knowl-
edgebase that aims to facilitate translational cancer research
[12]. The knowledgebase features multidisciplinary informa-
tion. For instance, for a given protein or drug, researchers
can obtain information on current understanding of the pro-
tein or drug, such as the expression or mutation of the protein
in cancer, cellular sensitivity proﬁles, and speciﬁc binding pro-
teins of the drug. A large collection of human proteome data is
housed in canSAR right now. Moreover, this database also
contains data and annotations for cancer, nontransformed cell
lines and protein 3D structure summaries.

NONCODE

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) function in a variety of cancer
types. NONCODE is a regularly-updated knowledgebase of
ncRNAs (except for tRNAs and rRNAs) from several species
such as human and mouse [13]. NONCODE was ﬁrst launched
in 2005 and was reported in Science NetWatch [14]. Version
4.0 of NONCODE has 595,854 ncRNA entries, among which
210,831 (about 35%) are long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). More than
80% of the ncRNA data in NONCODE are experimentally-
derived, thus providing users with a highly-credible resource.
In addition to providing lncRNA expression proﬁles across tis-
sues, NONCODE provides an online pipeline called iLncRNA
for users to analyze customized RNA-seq data. The database
also has an ID conversion function that changes RefSeq or
Ensembl IDs into NONCODE IDs.

Concluding remarks

Recent advances in genome and related information technolo-
gies have accelerated the bridging of scientiﬁc research and
clinical application, with the creation of publicly-accessible
data repository and analytical tools. Cancer genome data from
large-scale projects such as TCGA and ICGC are being used
by large ﬁrms to develop new targets and biomarkers. This
review provides a brief introduction to some representative
web-based resources that can be divided into ﬁve categories.
First, resources such as CGHub, EGA, COSMIC, and
cBioPortal serve as an encyclopedia of common cancers and
omics data types. Other resources offer tools for data analysis
and integration, and house some analysis results for query
(e.g., CPRG, GDAC, and canEvolve). The third class of tools
is mainly used for visualization (e.g., UCSC cancer browser

50

Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 13 (2015) 46–50

and CGWB). The fourth class includes databases that focus
on inferring the association of speciﬁc biological features to
cancer (e.g., MethyCancer, SomamiR, and NONCODE).
Finally, databases such as GDSC and CanSAR support the
application of genomics to drug discovery. Many other useful
resources for cancer research were not included in this paper
due to the scope limit. However, the move from bench to bed-
side remains a daunting task. One of the major obstacles is the
heterogeneity of cancer cells and the variability in the response
to anticarcinogens among patients with similar symptoms. To
address this issue, personal genomics projects should be
initiated in a larger population than the average sample size
for
In addition, advanced com-
putational and statistical methodologies aimed at big data
management and data mining should be developed to establish
the clinical relevance of cancer genomic discovery.
