Abstract Repetitive DNA sequences are a major component of eukaryotic genomes and may
account for up to 90% of the genome size. They can be divided into minisatellite, microsatellite
and satellite sequences. Satellite DNA sequences are considered to be a fast-evolving component
of eukaryotic genomes, comprising tandemly-arrayed, highly-repetitive and highly-conserved
monomer sequences. The monomer unit of satellite DNA is 150–400 base pairs (bp) in length.
Repetitive sequences may be species- or genus-speciﬁc, and may be centromeric or subtelomeric
in nature. They exhibit cohesive and concerted evolution caused by molecular drive, leading to high
sequence homogeneity. Repetitive sequences accumulate variations in sequence and copy number
during evolution, hence they are important tools for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, and
are known as ‘‘tuning knobs’’ in the evolution. Therefore, knowledge of repetitive sequences assists
our understanding of the organization, evolution and behavior of eukaryotic genomes. Repetitive
sequences have cytoplasmic, cellular and developmental effects and play a role in chromosomal
recombination. In the post-genomics era, with the introduction of next-generation sequencing tech-
nology, it is possible to evaluate complex genomes for analyzing repetitive sequences and decipher-
ing the yet unknown functional potential of repetitive sequences.

Introduction

Genomes of higher eukaryotes contain more DNA than
expected when estimates are based on the length and number
of coding genes in the genomes. The amount of DNA in the
unreplicated genome, or the haploid genome, of a species is
known as C-value or Constant-value [1,2]. The lack of

correlation between size and complexity of eukaryotic genomes,
largely due to the presence of noncoding highly repetitive DNA,
is termed as the C-value paradox, which is a common phenom-
enon observed in higher plants. It is believed that the proportion
of protein-coding sequences is generally similar for different
plant species, with variation in genome size mainly due to the
presence of repetitive DNA [3,4] that has accumulated in the
genomes during evolution, since ancestral angiosperms had
been indicated to possess small genomes [5]. The term ‘‘repeti-
tive sequences’’ refers to homologous DNA fragments that are
present in multiple copies in the genome. Repetitive DNA
sequences are present in all higher plants and can account for

up to 90% of the genome size in some species. These repetitive
DNA sequences are considered to generate major differences
between genomes, which may reﬂect evolutionary distances
between species. The repetitive sequences were once thought
to be ‘‘selﬁsh elements’’ or ‘‘junk DNA’’ [6,7], since they do
not harbor genes.

Knowledge of the distribution, genomic organization, chro-
mosomal location and evolutionary origin of repetitive DNA
sequences is necessary for insight into the organization, evolu-
tion, behavior and functional potential of repetitive sequences
in eukaryotic genomes [8]. In the last few decades, several
repetitive sequences have been analyzed (Table 1) to gain more
information on primary structure, molecular organization,
evolution and function of repetitive sequences, whereas more
recently genome-sequencing technology has produced an
unprecedented wealth of information about origin, diversity
and genomic impact of repetitive sequences [9].

Types and distribution of repetitive DNA sequences

The genomes of most eukaryotes contain a variety of repetitive
DNA sequences [10,11]. Repetitive DNA may be dispersed
throughout the genome or may be restricted at speciﬁc loca-
tions in a tandem conﬁguration. According to the length of
the repeated unit and array size, tandem repeated DNA
sequences can be classiﬁed into three groups: (i) microsatellites
with 2–5 bp repeats and an array size of the order of 10–100
units, (ii) minisatellites with 6–100 bp (usually around 15 bp)
repeats and an array size of 0.5–30 kb and (iii) satellite DNA
(satDNA) with a variable AT-rich repeat unit that often forms
arrays up to 100 Mb. The monomer length of satDNA
sequences ranges from 150–400 bp in majority of plants and
animals. satDNA sequences are located at heterochromatic
regions, which are found mostly in centromeric and subtelo-
meric regions in the chromosomes but also at intercalary posi-
tions. Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of
different types of repetitive sequences on a plant chromosome.
Satellite DNAs are portions of the genome that can be sepa-
rated as satellite peaks from primary DNA peaks [12] using
the methods including restriction endonuclease digestion, col-
ony ﬁlter hybridization with relic DNA, ampliﬁcation with
speciﬁc primers, colony ﬁlter hybridization and genomic self-
ampliﬁcation (also known as self-priming) [13].

Clustered DNA repeats can be detected in centromeric and
telomeric heterochromatin, and are transcriptionally inert. Cen-
tromeric DNA (such as CENH3) is the most abundant tandem
repeats found in both plants and animals [14]. In contrast, subt-
elomeric repetitive sequence families are usually genus-speciﬁc,
such as TrsA and Os48 in Oryza species [15,16]; TrsB in Oryza
brachyantha [17]; SacI family in Silene latifolia [18]; and
pAv34, pAc34, pRp34, pRn34 and pRs34 in Beta species [19],
or chromosome (Chr)-speciﬁc, such as WE 35 on Chr 5B in Trit-
icum aestivum [20], JNK family on Chr 2R in Secale cereale [21],
AfaI family in Poaceae members [22], TRI on Chr Y in Silene
latifolia [23] and RUSI on Chr 1 in Rumex species [24].

A particular sequence may be either species-speciﬁc or pres-
ent in many species within a taxonomic family or various
families,
indicating that some repetitive sequences evolve
rapidly, whereas others may be conserved [25]. For instance,
the CL600 satellite repeat isolated from Citrus limon was
detected in other Rutaceae members (C. aurantium, C. paradisi,

Poncirus trifoliata and Fortunella margarita) [26]. Similarly, the
PCvKB repetitive DNA isolated from Crocus vernus was present
in 16 species of Crocus analyzed and 2 species of Iridaceae, 3 spe-
cies of Liliaceae and 1 species of Amaryllidaceae [27]. The Hin-
dIII repeat of Brassica campestris shows homology not only to
that of other Brassica species but also to that of Raphanus sati-
vus, Sinapis alba, Diplotaxis muralis and Erucastrum sp. [28].
Repetitive elements in cauliﬂower, mustard and radish, all
belonging to Brassicaceae family, show 75%–80% homologies
[29,30]. Mehrotra et al.
the
pCtKpnI-I satellite repeat, initially isolated from Carthamus
tinctorius and other species of Carthamus [31], is present in
widely divergent families of angiosperms [32].

[31] recently reported that

satDNA, has

Various repetitive sequences from diverse taxa have been
integrated into a database for easy accessibility. PlantSat, a
database specialized for plant
integrated
sequence data from several resources such as NCBI and
DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) [33], to provide a list of sat-
DNA sequences for members of many plant families including
Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cucurbitaceae and
Solanaceae [34–36], as well as many other plants. Plant sat-
DNA sequences commonly have monomer unit lengths of
135–195 bp or 315–375 bp, which are consistent with reports
that
the basic monomer units of plant repetitive DNA
sequences correspond to the length of DNA wrapped around
a nucleosomal particle [10,33,37].

Different families of repetitive sequences show consistent
presence of motifs like AA/TT dinucleotides, pentanucleotide
CAAAA, etc. The presence of conserved motifs in unrelated
repetitive sequence families suggests their signiﬁcance for
molecular mechanisms underlying the ampliﬁcation and main-
tenance of tandem repeats in a genome, and the determination
of speciﬁc chromatin properties of loci containing the repeti-
tive DNA [33]. The occurrence of short, direct and inverted
repeats and short palindromes is a characteristic feature of var-
ious plant satellite families. These may act as preferential sites
for changes and as potential substrates for homologous recom-
bination allowing rearrangements
[38–42]. The repetitive
sequences have the nearest-neighbor characteristics with high
frequencies of GG, AG and GA nearest neighbors [43], which
originate during the repair of heteroduplex intermediates of
the exchange [44,45]. Frequent occurrence of GGT and GTT
trinucleotides in the monomers of repeat sequences makes
the sequence suitable substrate for the de novo telomere synthe-
sis in the repairing process of broken chromosome ends [46].
Another characteristic feature of repetitive sequences is
methylation. Methylation of DNA sequences is considered to
trigger structural changes in DNA strands [21,22]. Methylation
has been observed in satellite repeats following restriction
analysis of genomic DNA with MspI and HpaI. Methylation
has been reported to occur in a 500 bp satellite repeat family
in Arabidopsis [47], in a JNK repeat family in Japanese rye
[21], in a pCtKpnI repeat family in Carthamus [31], and many
other repeat families [26,48].

Functions of repetitive sequences

Repetitive DNA sequences are present in the heterochromatin
region. Heterochromatin has been associated with several func-
tions ranging from regulating gene expression to protecting
chromosomal integrity. Heterochromatin can incur different

levels of expression of adjacent genes during inheritance,
because of either a position effect or juxta-position of hetero-
chromatin and highly active genes, as observed in Drosophila
and Saccharomyces [49–52].

chromosome association with the mitotic

Repetitive sequences are implicated in numerous processes
such as chromosome movement and pairing, centromeric con-
densation, chromosome recombination, sister chromatid pair-
ing,
spindle,
chromosome arrangement, interaction of chromatin proteins,
histone binding, determination of chromosome structure,
karyotypic evolution, regulation of gene expression and genome
response to environmental stimuli and physiological changes.
These are all considered key components of evolutionary mech-
anisms and karyotypic differentiation [53,32]. Therefore, repet-
itive sequences play an important role in the evolution of species
[54], and they are all speculated to model the regulatory patterns
of genes leading to phenotypic variation [55]. The occurrence of
species-speciﬁc satDNA enables rapid and reliable identiﬁcation
of species. Grewal and Elgin [56] proposed the transcription of
satDNA and its impact on heterochromatin, particularly in
terms of the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin
structure. Repetitive DNA sequence elements are also involved
in cooperative molecular interactions for the formation of nucle-
oprotein complexes [57]. Repeat sequences may attract some
speciﬁc nuclear proteins, and the chromatin folding code dic-
tates the DNA–protein interactions, which may underlie the

genetic function of the tandem repeats [58]. Tandem repeats
are proposed as ‘‘tuning knobs’’ in the evolution due to their
ability to adjust the genetic hereditary traits and thereby facili-
tate the adaptation [59,60]. Melters et al. [14] have suggested that
tandem repeats at centromeres may promote the concerted evo-
lution of centromere DNA across chromosomes owing to their
high prevalence. Centromere DNA transcripts have been
reported to be involved in centromere structure and function
[61]. It is speculated that if repetitive DNA is transposable, it
may create novel genes [62]. The functions of satellite sequences
are still not clear. In the post-genomics era, due to a wealth of
resources, it is possible to gain insights into the functional poten-
tial of repetitive sequences.

Evolution of repetitive sequences

Repetitive DNA sequences exhibit cohesive and concerted evo-
lution by mechanisms that cause continuous nuclear genome
turnover and constitute molecular drive. Such concerted evolu-
tion produces high homogeneity in a repetitive DNA family
where mutations are diagnostic for species, and are the origin
of interspecies genetic divergence [63,64]. satDNA exhibits
internal sequence variability depending on the ratio between
mutation and homogenization/ﬁxation rates within a species
[65]. Levels of sequence identity between the satellite repeats
can be attributed by the following factors: the rates and biases
of transfer between homologous and nonhomologous chromo-
somes, the number and distribution of repeats, the physical
constraints within the genome, the generation time, the effec-
tive population size and various biological and selective
constraints [66].

Tandem repetitive sequences are considered to be generated
de novo by the combinatorial action of molecular mechanisms
such as mutations, unequal crossing over, gene conversion, slip-
page replication and/or rolling circle replication [44,67], which
create and maintain homogeneity of satDNA sequences within
species [65,68]. Among them, sequence duplication by aberrant
recombination [69,70] or replication slippage [67,71,72] repre-
sents the primary event in the formation of a repeat.

Unequal crossing over is assumed to be the primary evolu-
tionary force acting on satellite sequences [44]. Arrays of sat-
DNA are maintained by unequal exchange and intrastrand
exchange [73] and unequal crossing over accounts for the alter-
ations in copy numbers of satellite monomers [44]. Individual
repetitive units do not evolve independently; instead, the arrays
evolve in concert. However, unequal crossing over, by itself,
cannot create large tandem arrays of satDNA. Gene ampliﬁca-
tion and subsequent duplications also play a signiﬁcant role in
satDNA evolution. A few repeats may excise from a tandem
array and circularize to provide a template for rolling circle rep-
lication [72], and after ampliﬁcation into a linear array, the
repeats may be inserted into a new location in the genome.

Repetitive elements are under different evolutionary con-
straints as compared to genes, and are considered as fast-
evolving components of eukaryotic genomes. The high evolu-
tion rates of repetitive sequences can be used to differentiate
related species [35,74–78]. Hybrid polyploids are excellent
models for studying the evolution of repetitive sequences
[37], and variations in their repetitive sequences allow them
to be used for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies [79].
Sequence homogeneity and evolution of repetitive sequences
are correlated with their copy number. Repetitive sequences
with a low copy number are homogeneous and evolve slowly,
whereas repetitive sequences with a high copy number are
more heterogeneous and evolve quickly [80,81]. Sequence
divergence in satDNA proceeds in a gradual manner due to
the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions. For instance,
sequences were highly conserved in the repetitive satDNA of
Palorus ratzeburgii and Palorus subdepressus [82,83]. In addi-
tion, high sequence conservation was also observed in human
a-satDNA repeat, which is a rare and a highly-conserved
repeat in the evolutionarily distant species such as chicken
and zebraﬁsh [84]. Similarly, the simple dodeca satDNA repeat
is also conserved among evolutionarily distant organisms such
as fruitﬂy, Arabidopsis and human [85]. Evolutionary persis-
tence of large tandem arrays is affected not only by the balance
between the rate of ampliﬁcation and the rate of unequal
exchange, but also by a wide range of mechanisms for
recombination, replication and gene ampliﬁcation. However,
the amount of bias in these processes acting on satDNA
remains unresolved. Nonetheless, natural selection does not
have any effect on satellite repeats, because satDNA sequences
are not

selection [6,7].

transcribable and are consequently neutral

Evolutionary signiﬁcance of repetitive sequences

Repetitive sequences are speculated to inﬂuence cytoplasmic,
cellular and developmental processes [86] by increasing gen-
ome size and affecting chromosomal recombination. satDNA
repeats represent recombination ‘‘hotspots’’ of genome reorga-
nization [87]. The occurrence of satDNA in interstitial and
telomeric heterochromatin reduces genetic recombination in
adjacent regions [87]. Robertsonian chromosome fusion or ﬁs-
sion, the joining of two telo/acrocentric chromosomes at their
centromeres to form a metacentric, has been postulated to
depend on sequence similarity of regions on the two chromo-
somes because of large amounts of centromeric, heterochro-
matic satDNA in eukaryotic genomes [88]. Satellite repeats
in eukaryotes are likely involved in sequence-speciﬁc interac-
tions and subsequently in epigenetic processes. Nonetheless,
repetitive satDNA also has a sequence-independent role in
the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin. Tran-
scripts from tandem arrays or satellites are processed by
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and Dicer to pro-
duce small
[89,90]. satDNA-
derived siRNAs are probably involved in posttranscriptional
gene regulation through the action of the RNA-induced silenc-
ing complex (RISC) [91]. Additionally, satDNA-derived siR-
NAs also have a possible role in gene expression and
heterochromatin formation on tandemly-repeated noncoding
regions, and in the expression of particular genes with embed-
ded satellite repeats [92].

interfering RNAs (siRNAs)

Recent advances and future perspectives

A remarkable advance in the knowledge of repetitive sequences
has occurred in recent years because of the introduction of
next-generation sequencing technologies. These technologies
can be applied to highly complex populations of repetitive ele-
ments in plant genomes, and have been used to characterize
genomes and establish phylogenies based on repetitive
sequences in Silene latifolia, Helianthus and Orobanche species
[93–97]. Various strategies such as single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNP) discovery and more sophisticated approaches
are being developed to assemble NGS data and to analyze
repeats for a better understanding of their contribution to gene
function and genome evolution [95]. 454 sequencing and Illu-
mina platforms have been extensively used to comprehensively
characterize repetitive DNA in the pea and olive genome as well
as the satellite sequences in Silene, including the detection of the
most conserved regions, reconstruction of consensus sequences
of repeat monomers, identiﬁcation of major sequence variants
and designing of hybridization probes for localization on chro-
mosomes using ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
[93,97,98]. 454 pyrosequencing was also used to detect copy-
number repeats in the soybean genome [99] and to deduce the
repeat composition of genomes for nine species of Orobancha-
ceae [94]. Recently, Sergeeva et al. [100] presented a detailed
account of repetitive sequences of wheat based on 454 sequenc-
ing. Whole genome shotgun sequencing has also been employed
to identify and analyze the most abundant tandem repeats from
diverse animal and plant species [14].

Various web tools have been recently introduced for the
analysis of repetitive sequences. A tool called ‘‘REViewer’’ was
developed for visualizing and analyzing repetitive elements [101].
A comprehensive toolkit ‘‘RepEx’’ was developed by Gurusaran
et al. [102] for extracting various repeats (inverted, everted and
mirror) from genomic sequences. Recently, Nova´ k et al. [103]
introduced a collection of software tools called ‘‘Repeat
Explorer’’ for characterizing repetitive elements and identifying
high- and medium-copy repeats in higher plant genomes.

Repetitive sequences are technically challenging to clone
and sequence and can be better studied by combining various
approaches like mapping and sequence analysis. Repetitive
sequences also pose challenges in sequencing and assembling
of genomes. Cytogenetics, genomics and bioinformatics tools
have allowed the genomes of complex eukaryotes to be investi-
gated. Whole genome resequencing studies, genome-wide anal-
ysis, transposon-based sequencing strategies and ﬁne mapping
of repetitive sequences can elucidate the structure, evolution,
and functional potential of this enigmatic yet indispensable
component of the genome. This will in turn assist in sequencing
and assembly of complex eukaryotic genomes.
