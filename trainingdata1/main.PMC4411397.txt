Abstract Biomarker is the measurable change associated with a physiological or pathophysiolog-
ical process. Unlike blood which has mechanisms to keep the internal environment homeostatic,
urine is more likely to reﬂect changes of the body. As a result, urine is likely to be a better biomarker
source than blood. However, since the urinary proteome is affected by many factors, including
diuretics, careful evaluation of those effects is necessary if urinary proteomics is used for biomarker
discovery. Here, we evaluated the effects of three commonly-used diuretics (furosemide, F; hydro-
chlorothiazide, H; and spirolactone, S) on the urinary proteome in rats. Urine samples were col-
lected before and after intragastric administration of diuretics at therapeutic doses and the
proteomes were analyzed using label-free liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS). Based on the criteria of P 6 0.05, a fold change P2, a spectral count P5, and false
positive rate (FDR) 61%, 14 proteins (seven for F, ﬁve for H, and two for S) were identiﬁed by
Progenesis LC–MS. The human orthologs of most of these 14 proteins are stable in the healthy
human urinary proteome, and ten of them are reported as disease biomarkers. Thus, our results
suggest that the effects of diuretics deserve more attention in future urinary protein biomarker
studies. Moreover, the distinct effects of diuretics on the urinary proteome may provide clues to
the mechanisms of diuretics.

Biomarker is the measurable change associated with a physio-
logical or pathophysiological process. Unlike blood is homeo-
static, urine is more likely to reﬂect changes of the body. In
other words, urine is likely to be a better biomarker source
than blood [1]. Saving urinary protein samples on the mem-
brane can facilitate storage of samples in large numbers and
help to speed up the biomarker research in urine proteome
[2]. Furthermore, compared to plasma, urine can be collected

continuously and noninvasively. Second, the urinary proteome
directly reﬂects the conditions of the urinary system. Third, it
can also reﬂect the physiological status of the whole human
body [3]. These advantages make the urinary proteome a suit-
able source for disease biomarker discovery.

To date, many urinary biomarkers have been reported in a
variety of diseases [3], such as various chronic and acute renal
injuries [4], bladder cancer [5], prostate cancer [6] and coronary
artery disease [7]. However, studies focusing on the urinary
protein biomarker discovery still face certain challenges. A ma-
jor issue is that the urinary proteomic pattern of an individual
may be affected by multiple factors, such as gender, age, diet
[8], medication, daily activities, exercises [9,10], smoking [11],
stress, menstrual cycle and other physiological variations.
Environmental factors including temperature and humidity
may also affect the urinary proteome. Therefore, these factors
should be taken into consideration in the urinary biomarker
research.

Effects of some factors, such as gender, age, daily activity
and environmental conditions, have been investigated previ-
ously [12–14]. However, effects of some other factors, espe-
cially medication, are difﬁcult to examine, since the regular
therapeutic process of patients should not be disturbed during
urine collection. Therefore, inﬂuences of medications on the
urinary proteome should be taken into account during data
analysis and interpretation.

Diuretics are among the most commonly used medications.
They are used to induce negative ﬂuid and sodium balances in
a variety of clinical situations, including hypertension, heart
failure, renal failure, nephritic syndrome, and cirrhosis [15].
However, it remains unclear whether and how diuretics affect
the urinary proteome, which hampers the urinary biomarker
discovery for those diseases.

In this study, we examined the effects of furosemide, hydro-
chlorothiazide, and spirolactone on the urinary proteome
using label-free quantitative proteomics [16]. These drugs rep-
resent thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing
diuretics, respectively, which are the three types of commonly
used diuretics with different modes of action [17]. The rat urine
samples were collected before and after the diuretics were
administered, digested using the ﬁlter aided proteome prepara-
tion (FASP) method [16], and analyzed with a high-speed
TripleTOF 5600 system. Progenesis LC–MS was used to
quantify the urinary proteins.

Results and discussion

The effects of diuretics on rat urine volumes

In order to evaluate the direct effects of diuretics on rats, urine
samples were collected before and 1, 3, or 5 days after the
diuretics were administered intragastrically. As shown in
Table S1, the rat urinary volumes increased signiﬁcantly
(2–3 folds, P < 0.05) after the administration of furosemide
(F) and hydrochlorothiazide (H), especially within the ﬁrst 8 h
after lavage. This period is the effective time of the diuretics.
However, there is no signiﬁcant increase in urine output
(P > 0.05), after the rats were administered with spirolactone
(S), probably due to the fact that spirolactone is not an

efﬁcient diuretic on its own and usually is applied in combina-
tion with other diuretics.

SDS–PAGE analysis of the urine samples

As a ﬁrst step of the sample analysis, the urine samples col-
lected on different days were separated by SDS–PAGE. As
shown in Figure 1A, the protein patterns of the urine samples
in the H group changed only modestly among those obtained
before and 1, 3 and 5 days after the diuretic administration.
However, for the F and S groups, there were some signiﬁcant
changes among samples obtained at different time points, espe-
cially those on Day 3 after gavage for the F group (Figure 1B)
and Day 1 for the S group (Figure 1C). Therefore, normal ur-
ine samples, Day 3 for the F and H group and Day 1 for the S
group were further analyzed using 1D-LC–MS/MS.

The changes of the rat urine proteome after diuretic
administration

To investigate the changes of the urine proteome after diuretic
administration, a total of 18 LC–MS/MS runs of urine samples
from three different rats in each diuretic group were analyzed.
The 18 datasets were analyzed using Progenesis LC–MS and
Mascot Daemon. The false discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted
to be less than 1%. As a result, we identiﬁed 331, 302, and 325
proteins in the F, S and H group, respectively (Tables S2–S4).
The identiﬁed peptides are listed in Table S5. All the Supple-
mentary materials can be found in the urinary protein bio-
marker database [3] (http://122.70.220.102/biomarker).

The coefﬁcients of variation (CVs) for each of the three lev-
els of sample variation––before gavage, after gavage, and be-
tween these two conditions––were calculated. As shown in
Figure 2, the CV values of the samples after gavage were
slightly higher than those before gavage (median CV values:
0.25 vs. 0.34 for F group; 0.35 vs. 0.39 for S group and 0.28
vs. 0.31 for H group), probably because rats respond differen-
tially to the diuretics. In contrast, the CV values of the samples
for between before and after gavage and for after gavage (med-
ian CV of F group is 0.45; median CV of S group is 0.55) are
signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05), suggesting that furosemide and
spirolactone can change the urine proteome. However, the CV
values of H-Between (median CV is 0.33) were not changed
signiﬁcantly, indicating that hydrochlorothiazide has no dis-
cernable effects on the rat urine proteome at this dosage.

The effects of different diuretics on the urinary proteome

Using the label-free quantiﬁcation by the Progenesis LC–MS
software, we identiﬁed seven (ﬁve up-regulated and two
down-regulated) (Table 1), ﬁve (one up-regulated and four
down-regulated) (Table 2) and two (one up-regulated and
one down-regulated) proteins with signiﬁcantly changed
expression in all three rats in the F, S and H groups, respec-
tively, according to the criteria: P 6 0.05, a fold change P2
and a spectral count P5. Five of the seven proteins in the F
group and all of the ﬁve proteins in the S group have been re-
ported to be disease biomarkers. For example, haptoglobin is a
candidate biomarker for patients with bladder cancers, acute

changed proteins in H group include beta-microseminoprotein
and EGF-containing ﬁbulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1.
However, neither of them has been reported as biomarkers
previously. Therefore, hydrochlorothiazide appears to have a
lower
impact on urine proteome than furosemide and
spirolactone at the dosages tested. Interestingly, no signiﬁ-
cantly changed proteins are shared by any two groups,

indicating the distinct effects of the diuretics on the urinary
proteome.

Note: a Protein present in the 122.R_norvegicus.orthologues database; b Proteins present in the Ensembl Compare database.

(co-orthologs) retain similar functions between species [32,33].
We thus transformed the signiﬁcantly changed proteins with
diuretic administration in rats to human orthologs. Based on
the 122.R_norvegicus.orthologues database and Ensembl
Compare database [34], eight of the 14 rat urinary proteins
have human orthologs (Table 3). By comparing the proteins
with the human core urinary proteome, we further found that
seven human orthologs are relatively stable proteins in the nor-
mal human urinary proteome [35,36]. Therefore, such proteins
could serve as potential urinary biomarkers, since signiﬁcant
qualitative or quantitative changes of these stable proteins
may suggest some pathophysiological conditions [36].

Conclusions

In this manuscript, the effects of three diuretics on the urinary
proteome were examined in rats. We have shown for the ﬁrst
time through a proteomic approach that some candidate uri-
nary biomarkers may be affected by diuretics, suggesting that
the effects of diuretics should be carefully evaluated in the fu-
ture urinary protein biomarker studies. The results obtained
here could help minimize the interference of diuretics with bio-
marker discovery using the urinary proteomics. In addition,
the studies on these signiﬁcantly changed proteins may provide
insights into mechanisms of diuretics as well as renal clearance
of proteins. However, some limitations of this study should be
noted. First, the ﬁndings in this study need to be veriﬁed in hu-
mans. Second, it would be ideal to validate our results in stud-
ies with a higher statistical power. Furthermore, the effects of
doses and durations of diuretics on the urinary proteome
should also be evaluated in the future. In addition, other com-
monly used medications, such as glucocorticoids and angioten-
sin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), may likewise affect
the urinary proteome and should also be further studied.

Materials and methods

Animals and ethics statement

Pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–160 g) were
purchased from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science,
Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). They
were given a standard laboratory diet and free access to tap
water. The rats were maintained in a room with controlled
temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and humidity (65%–70%) and a
12:12 h light:dark cycle. The study was performed after the
rats had been allowed to acclimate for 1 week. This study
was approved by the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences Ani-
mal Ethics Committee, Peking Union Medical College (Ani-
mal Welfare Assurance Number: A5518). All rats received
humane care in compliance with the institutional animal care
guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Peking Union Medical College.

Intragastric administration of diuretics and urine collection

Urine samples from 15 rats were collected after each rat was
given 1 ml saline by intragastric administration for 24 h using
metabolic cages, and these samples were used as controls.
Then, the rats were randomly divided into three groups with
ﬁve rats in each group. Each group of rats was given either
20 mg/(kgÆd) of furosemide, 20 mg/(kgÆd) of spirolactone, or
25 mg/(kgÆd) of hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. The dosing
volumes of diuretics were adjusted to 1 ml. All rats were given
diuretics by intragastric administration for 5 days, and the rat
urine samples were collected on 1, 3 and 5 days after diuretic
administration as described above. The samples were acidiﬁed
immediately with hydrochloric acid and then cooled to 4 °C to

124

prevent bacterial growth and proteolysis. No rats died during
the experiments.

Database searching and protein identiﬁcation

Acetone precipitation

All the urine samples were centrifuged at 5000 · g for 30 min,
and the pellets were removed. The supernatants were precipi-
tated with 75% v/v acetone for 12 h followed by centrifugation
at 12 000 · g for 30 min. After removing supernatant, the pel-
lets were thoroughly air-dried, resuspended in the lysis buffer
(8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM Tris and 25 mM DTT) and
subjected to protein quantitation by the Bradford assay.

SDS–PAGE analysis

For each sample, 30 lg of proteins were dissolved in the PAGE
sample buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mM DTT, 0.5%
SDS and 10% glycerol) and incubated at 97 °C for 5 min.
The proteins were then resolved by SDS–PAGE. After electro-
phoresis, the gels were stained using Coomassie brilliant blue.

FASP cleanup and overnight digestion

FASP was performed using NANOSPE 10 K OMEGA centrif-
ugal devices (PALL life sciences, NY, Washington, USA) fol-
lowing previously described procedures [37]. Brieﬂy, 100 lg of
urinary proteins samples were mixed with 0.2 ml of 8 M urea
in 0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, loaded onto the membrane ﬁlter
and centrifuged at 14,000 · g for 35 min. Then the samples
were reduced and alkylated. Finally, sequencing grade modiﬁed
trypsin was added at a protein-to-enzyme ratio of 50:1, fol-
lowed by incubation overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides
were eluted from the ﬁlters twice using 0.1 ml of 50 mM ammo-
nium bicarbonate and then desalted by solid-phase extraction
using the Oasis HLB Extraction Cartridge (Waters, Milford,
MA, USA), dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended with 20 ll of
0.1% formic acid and stored at  80 °C until use.

The Mascot Daemon software (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science,
London) was used to search the MS/MS data against the
SwissProt_rat database (release 2012_07; taxonomy: Rattus;
containing 7787 sequences). The carbamidomethylation of cys-
teines was set as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation. The oxidation of methi-
onine and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable
modiﬁcations. The speciﬁcity of trypsin digestion was set for
cleavage after K or R, and two missed trypsin cleavage sites
were allowed. The mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were
both set to 0.05 Da. After the Mascot search, the signiﬁcance
threshold and ion score cut-off were set to 0.05 using MudPIT
protein scoring. FDR was adjusted to less than 1% when the
search result was exported.

Label-free quantiﬁcation

For label-free quantiﬁcation, the acquired raw data ﬁles corre-
sponding to the different samples were imported into the Pro-
genesis LC–MS software version 4.1 (Nonlinear Dynamics,
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) for feature detection, alignment,
and quantiﬁcation. All sample features were aligned according
to retention times by automatic alignment to maximally over-
lay all the two-dimensional (m/z and retention time) feature
maps. Then, the single-charged peptides and the peptides with
charge states higher than three were excluded from the analy-
sis. After alignment, the samples were divided into the appro-
priate groups: furosemide before (normal urine samples) and
after (urine samples collected after gavage); hydrochlorothia-
zide before and after; and spirolactone before and after. Urine
samples before and after gavage from the same rats were inter-
nal control. The peak lists generated by the Progenesis LC–MS
software were used for protein identiﬁcation as described
above and then re-imported into the software. For quantiﬁca-
tion, only unique peptides were included, and the total cumu-
lative abundance was calculated by summing the individual
abundance of all peptides assigned to each protein [38].

LC–MS/MS

Statistical analysis

Urine samples from three rats in each group were analyzed
using an AB SCIEX (Framingham, MA, USA) Triple-TOF
5600 mass spectrometer. Each sample was analyzed once.
Brieﬂy, the tryptic peptides (2 lg in each sample) were ana-
lyzed using a RP C18 capillary LC column (100 lm · 150 mm,
3 lm) from Michrom Bioresources (Michrom BioResources,
Westford, MA, USA). The eluted gradient was 5%–30%
buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile; ﬂow rate,
0.5 ll/min) for 100 min. The MS data were acquired by Tri-
ple-TOF MS using an ion spray voltage of 3 kV, curtain gas
of 20 psi, nebulizer gas of 30 psi, and an interface heater tem-
perature of 150 °C. The precursors were acquired in 500 ms
ranging from 350 to 1250 Da, and the product ion scans were
acquired in 50 ms ranging from 250 to 1800 Da. A rolling
collision energy setting was used. A total of 30 product ion
scans were collected if exceeding a threshold of 125 counts
per second (counts/s) and with a +2 to +5 charge-state for
each cycle.

Percentages of variances were calculated from the median CV,
which is the standard deviation divided by the mean of a
measurement. P values were generated by t-test.
