The authors of the above article would like the following to be
noted. Results reported for the reporter algorithm (RA) in the
Results section are raw z-scores per metabolite, normalized by sub-
tracting the sample mean and dividing by the sample standard devi-
ation. Using the background correction as described in the original
scoring scheme (Ideker et al., 2002; Patil and Nielsen, 2005) re-
moves the hub metabolite bias we claim for the RA (for both nor-
malization by k and
). This affects only our comparisons with
RA, and MIRA’s results are not changed. The background correc-
tion improves the empirical significance of the RA as shown in
Figure 5A and C. After the background correction, RA is among the
top three permutations. MIRA still performs better but with a
smaller margin than shown in Figure 5. We have updated the lists of
reporter metabolites (for RA) in the supplementary file.
