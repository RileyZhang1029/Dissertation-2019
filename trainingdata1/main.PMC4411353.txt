Abstract Myeloid leukemias are highly diverse diseases and have been shown to be associated with
microRNA (miRNA) expression aberrations. The present study involved an in-depth miRNome
analysis of two human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, HL-60 and THP-1, and one
human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line, K562, via massively parallel signature sequenc-
ing. mRNA expression proﬁles of these cell lines that were established previously in our lab facil-
itated an integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression patterns. miRNA expression
proﬁling followed by differential expression analysis and target prediction suggested numerous
miRNA signatures in AML and CML cell lines. Some miRNAs may act as either tumor suppres-
sors or oncomiRs in AML and CML by targeting key genes in AML and CML pathways. Expres-
sion patterns of cell type-speciﬁc miRNAs could partially reﬂect the characteristics of K562, HL-60
and THP-1 cell lines, such as actin ﬁlament-based processes, responsiveness to stimulus and phag-
ocytic activity. miRNAs may also regulate myeloid differentiation, since they usually suppress dif-
ferentiation regulators. Our study provides a resource to further investigate the employment of
miRNAs in human leukemia subtyping, leukemogenesis and myeloid development. In addition,
the distinctive miRNA signatures may be potential candidates for the clinical diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment of myeloid leukemias.

Myeloid development is an important component of hemato-
poiesis, which involves a step-wise progression characterized
by sequential regulator expression [1]. Mutation or dysregula-
tion of those regulators may result in a failure to induce differ-
entiation during myeloid development, thereby leading to
myeloid leukemias. Myeloid leukemias,

myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML), are clonal bone marrow diseases characterized by
the pathological proliferation of abnormal white blood cells.
A large number of studies have addressed myeloid leukemia
classiﬁcation, diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapy, and have
investigated chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations and
epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone
modiﬁcations [2]. Leukemia cell lines, such as the CML cell
line K562 [3], the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line
HL-60 [4] and the acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) cell line
THP-1 [5], have been widely used in AML and CML studies,
owing to their distinct genetic backgrounds, abundant epige-
netic data
and readily-identiﬁable biological
functions.

[8,9]. Notably,

The past decade witnessed an explosion of knowledge
regarding microRNAs (miRNAs) and their roles in both nor-
mal physiological and disease contexts. miRNAs are small
non-coding RNAs 19–25 nucleotides in length, which can inhi-
bit the translation or induce the degradation of mRNA, usu-
ally by binding to the 30-untranslated regions (UTRs) of
target mRNAs [6]. Since their initial observation, 1871 precur-
sors and 2794 mature human miRNAs have been registered in
miRBase (GRCh37.p5, v20) [7]. miRNA expression proﬁling is
gaining popularity because miRNA signatures have been
associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases such
as leukemias
stable miRNAs have been
reproducibly identiﬁed in serum or plasma, and the unique
expression patterns of serum or plasma miRNAs can be used
as biomarkers for various diseases [10,11]. miRNAs have been
proﬁled using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), high-
throughput microarray and sequencing technologies [12].
Given its increasing availability and decreasing costs, high-
throughput sequencing has emerged as an attractive approach
for global miRNA analysis that provides advantages over the
other two aforementioned technologies. These include a
high accuracy in distinguishing miRNAs with very similar
sequences and isomiRs, a high sensitivity for detecting novel
low-abundance miRNAs, and a wide expression range for
analyzing the expression of all annotated miRNAs [13,14].

Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs play crucial
roles in myeloid development and leukemogenesis. For exam-
ple, the hematopoietic lineage-speciﬁc miR-223 enhances reti-
noic acid-induced granulocyte differentiation by targeting
NFIA encoding nuclear factor I/A [15] but inhibits erythroid
differentiation by downregulating LMO2 encoding LIM
domain only 2 [16]. In addition, the miR-17-92 cluster has been
characterized as an oncomiR in B-cell lymphomas [17]. Con-
versely, miR-29b was shown to function as a tumor suppressor
in AML by targeting several DNA methyltransferases, and the
ectopic expression of miR-29b was shown to induce the re-
expression of tumor suppressor genes [18]. Large-scale miRNA
expression proﬁling has been used to analyze the roles of miR-
NAs in the context of imatinib treatment of CML [19] or the
distinction between cytogenetic and molecular AML subtypes
[20,21]. We previously examined K562, HL-60 and THP-1 cell
lines using mRNA transcriptomic analysis and revealed the
differences in pathways between CML and AML, the unique
functional characteristics of myeloid cells and the distinct gene
expression patterns throughout myeloid development [22]. In
this study, deep sequencing was used to distinguish AMLs
and CMLs by comparing the miRNomes between the AML
lines HL-60 and THP-1 and the CML line K562 and to

elucidate the differences in miRNA expression at various dif-
ferentiation stages. We also revealed functional miRNAs that
either targeted AML and CML pathways,
induced unique
functional characteristics in myeloid cells or regulated myeloid
development. The miRNA signatures identiﬁed in our study
provide a resource for clinical applications of miRNAs in the
context of myeloid leukemias.

Results

Small RNA expression proﬁling in myeloid leukemia cell lines

We applied massively parallel sequencing for an in-depth anal-
ysis of the miRNomes of three myeloid leukemia cell lines
including K562 (CML), HL-60 (APL) and THP-1 (AMoL).
Small RNA (sRNA) fractions isolated from each sample were
size-selected using electrophoresis and sequenced on the Illu-
mina GA IIx platform. The generated sRNA sequencing data
were then analyzed using the deep-sequencing sRNA analysis
pipeline (DSAP) web server [23]. As shown in Table 1, 22–26
million high-quality raw reads were generated from the three
samples, and the reliability of each sample exceeded 99.8%.
The miRNA reads represented approximately 54% and 58%
of the total reads in HL-60 and THP-1, respectively, suggesting
that miRNAs are the predominant sRNA species in these cell
lines. However, only approximately 14% of the total reads in
K562 were derived from miRNAs, a ﬁnding that was also
noted in a previous study [24]. Further, 474, 455 and 413 miR-
NAs in K562, HL-60 and THP-1 cell
lines were matched
in miRBase (Version 16 on the DSAP server), respectively.
A total of 621 known miRNAs were detected in at least one
of the three sequenced samples.

miRNA expression patterns

The absolute read counts were transformed into transcript
abundances by normalizing the read counts of each miRNA
using the cloning frequency (CF) in each library [14]. To test
the reliability of miRNA sequencing, we compared the CF val-
ues from sequencing with the expression intensities obtained
from the RT-qPCR analysis of 7 different miRNAs including
let-7i, miR-10a, miR-143, miR-148a, miR-16, miR-17 and
miR-181a. Our results showed that the two sets of miRNA
expression agreed with each other well (Figure 1A; R2 =
0.6579, P = 8.7 · 10 7), thus suggesting that the CF can be
used as an abundance indicator. In addition, the results also
conﬁrmed the integrity and relevance of the samples used in
this study.

A wide range of expression (CF values 0.00001–35) was
observed in the sequencing data (Figure 1B). The majority of
the miRNAs were expressed at low levels; approximately
16%–32% of the miRNAs in each sample exhibited a low abun-
dance (CF < 0.0001). However, expression of a few miRNAs
accounted for the majority of the total expression. For exam-
ple, expression of 12 highly-expressed miRNAs accounted for
90% of the total expression in K562, whereas 90% of the total
expression in HL-60 and THP-1 was attributed to the
expression of 25 and 17 highly-expressed miRNAs, respec-
tively (Figure 1C). Overall, 33 miRNAs were highly expressed
in at least one of the three leukemia cell lines (Table S1).

Among them, miR-191 and miR-25 were highly expressed in
all three cell lines and their expression was upregulated relative
to that in normal cells [24]. These data indicated that these
miRNAs may share a common role in leukemogenesis or
leukemic progression. miR-191 and miR-25 displayed elevated
expression and functioned as oncogenes in AML and several
solid
including
miR-486-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-127-3p, miR-20a, miR-21*,
miR-10a, miR-22 and miR-30e, were highly expressed only
in K562, whereas 6 members of the let-7 family (let-7f,

[8,20,24–27]. Eight miRNAs,

cancers

let-7a, let-7g, let-7d, let-7b and let-7i) and 9 other miRNAs
(miR-103-as, miR-222, miR-181a, miR-221, miR-320a,
miR-140-3p, miR-185, miR-423-5p and miR-29a) were highly
expressed in both AML cell
lines. Besides miR-185 and
miR-29a in HL-60, the remaining 13 miRNAs that were
highly expressed in both AML cell
lines had also been
previously reported as high-abundance miRNAs in HL-60
and THP-1 [20]. Interestingly, 18 of
the high-abundance
miRNAs in the AML lines were identiﬁed in the AML miRNA
network [28].

three cell lines
The overlapping regions show the numbers of miRNAs expressed
in two or three cell lines.

Since numerous low-abundance miRNAs were observed in
these samples, we decided to primarily focus on miRNAs with
CFs of >0.1%. Using this cutoff, >99.9% of all miRNA
reads from each sample were included for a further analysis.
A total of 307 miRNAs had a CF of >0.1% in at least one cell
line, of which 238, 197 and 160 miRNAs were expressed in
K562, HL-60 and THP-1, respectively (Figure 2).

The identiﬁcation of novel miRNAs is a unique advantage
of high-throughput sequencing. We predicted novel miRNAs
using miRDeep*, an improved miRDeep pipeline [29]. A total
of 409, 894 and 1159 novel miRNAs were predicted in the
three samples, of which only 19.1% (K562), 8.5% (HL-60)
and 6.5% (THP-1) had expression levels >0.001. Notably,
several novel miRNAs were predicted with a high level of
conﬁdence (miRDeep* score of >10) in the three cell lines
(Table 2), some of which were highly expressed and may be
potential candidates for future analyses. These results suggest
that high-throughput sRNA sequencing is a good approach
for the detection of low-abundance miRNAs and novel miR-
NAs due to the wide detection range.

Distinctive miRNA signatures in myeloid cells

A total of 110 miRNAs were expressed in all three cell lines,
whereas 95, 25 and 9 miRNAs were uniquely expressed in
K562, HL-60 and THP-1, respectively (Figure 2). We initially
analyzed these uniquely-expressed miRNAs to identify the cell
type-related miRNAs.

The 95 K562-speciﬁc miRNAs included three highly-
expressed miRNAs (miR-486-5p, miR-127-3p and miR-10a)
in K562 as well as several erythropoiesis-related miRNAs such

as miR-451, miR-144, miR-376a and miR-126/126* [30–33].
The putative target genes of these K562-speciﬁc miRNAs were
predicted using miRecords [34] and ﬁltered to only include
mRNAs upregulated in both HL-60 and THP-1 according to
our previous mRNA-seq data [22]. Functional enrichment
analysis revealed that the targets were signiﬁcantly involved
in leukocyte activation, actin ﬁlament-based processes and
programmed cell death (see Figure S1A for the miRNAs and
targets involved in these processes). miR-486-5p and miR-
127-3p were expressed at extremely high levels in K562 cells.
The former participated in leukocyte activation and pro-
grammed cell death by targeting FOXP1 encoding forkhead
box P1 and UNC5C encoding unc-5 homolog C, and the latter
functions to regulate genes involved in apoptosis.

Among the HL-60-speciﬁc miRNAs, the high expression of
miR-124 and miR-326 had been previously conﬁrmed in AML
samples [35,36], and the targets of miR-124, miR-324-3p, miR-
326 and miR-573 mainly participate in biological processes
such as response to stimulus, regulation of endocytosis and
regulation of cellular component biogenesis (Figure S1B).
These functions are closely related to the phagocytic activity
and response to chemotactic stimuli of HL-60 cells [37].
miR-124 may be a potential regulator of the endocytosis func-
tion of HL-60 acting through its validated target LDLRAP1
encoding low density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1
[38] and putative target EPN2 encoding epsin 2. miR-503
has been experimentally validated to target CCND1 encoding
cyclin D1 [39], which is involved in responses to inorganic
substances. miR-573 targeted 5 genes, 4 of which are involved
in responses to inorganic substances, suggesting its potential
role as a regulator of HL-60 cell responsiveness.

THP-1-speciﬁc-miRNAs were expressed at low levels. The
targets of four THP-1-speciﬁc miRNAs, miR-455, miR-219-
5p, miR-449a and miR-455-5p, were enriched in the functions
of mesodermal development, intracellular receptor-mediated
signaling pathways, negative cell growth regulation and posi-
tive apoptosis regulation (Figure S1C). These four miRNAs
were also responsible for the phagocytic activity of THP-1 cells
[5]. In addition, monocytes have been reported to play impor-
tant roles in development and homeostasis, partially by remov-
ing apoptotic cells and scavenging toxic compounds [40]. In
particular, miR-219-5p and miR-449a may target 5–6 genes
associated with these functions. In summary, these uniquely-
expressed miRNAs are cell function-related and may reﬂect
the unique characteristics of the corresponding cell lines.

Differentially-expressed miRNAs between CML and AML cell
lines

The three representative cell lines were derived from patients
with myeloid leukemia and thus can reﬂect clinical features
of myeloid leukemia to some extent. To study the underlying
patterns of miRNA expression and the relationship between
the samples, we applied a hierarchical clustering method that
incorporated all 307 miRNAs. This analysis showed that the
expression patterns of HL-60 and THP-1 miRNAs were more
similar to each other than to those of K562 miRNAs
(Figure 3A), which may be attributed to the fact that K562 is
a CML cell line whereas HL-60 and THP-1 are AML cell lines.
We also analyzed the differentially-expressed miRNAs on the
basis of statistical analyses and fold changes described in the
Materials and methods section. A pair-wise comparison of
miRNA expression revealed larger differences between K562
and HL-60 or THP-1 than between HL-60 and THP-1
(Figure 3B). Therefore, there is an evident difference in miRNA
proﬁles between the CML cell line (K562) and the AML cell
lines (HL-60 and THP-1).

Expression of 126 miRNAs including 93 K562-speciﬁc ones
was upregulated in the CML line, whereas expression of
83 miRNAs was upregulated in both AML cell
lines
(Figure 3C). Previous studies have comprehensively shown
the relevance of miRNAs with respect to cytogenetic altera-
tions in AML cell lines [20,21]; therefore, we did not intend
to address this topic in HL-60 and THP-1. CML is character-
ized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) [3], which results
from the reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22
[t(9;22)(q34;q11)] and leads
the
BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein [41]. During the blast crisis phase,
CML is also associated with the expression of the AML-1/

EVI-1 and NUP98/HOXA9 fusion proteins resulting from
t(3;21)(q26;q22) and t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocations, respec-
tively [3,42]. Notably, miR-126, which is mapped to 9q34,
was uniquely expressed in K562 cells. Expression of the
miR-301b-130b cluster transcribed from 22q11 and miR-148a
and miR-196b transcribed from 7p15 was upregulated in K562
cells; in contrast, expression of miR-199b-3p transcribed from
9q34 and miR-185 transcribed from 22q11 was downregulated
in K562 cells. The genomic locations and expression patterns
of these miRNAs suggested their potential roles in CML.

In K562, the upregulated miRNAs included four members

CML pathogenesis [43]. miR-10a, miR-125, miR-151, miR-
199a-5p, miR-96, miR-451, miR-183, miR-134, miR-126,
miR-144 and miR-224 have been detected in CML patients
[44,45]. In AML lines, the upregulated miRNAs included 6
members of the let-7 family, 3 miR-181s and 21 miRNAs that
have been previously described in AML miRNA expression
proﬁles or networks [28,35]. Pathway analysis (Table 3)
revealed that the targets of upregulated miRNAs in K562 were
enriched in processes upregulated in AML cells (enriched from
upregulated genes in AML vs. CML), such as chemokine
signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, neuro-
trophin signaling pathway and acute myeloid leukemia path-
way; conversely, the targets of the upregulated miRNAs in
AML lines were enriched in CML-upregulated processes
(enriched from upregulated genes in CML vs. AML), such as
adherens junction, TGF-b signaling pathway, p53 signaling
pathway. Most of these function-enriched miRNAs were also
upregulated in HL-60 or K562 cells compared with normal
cells [24]. Moreover, 6 let-7 family members were the most
upregulated miRNAs in AML cell lines. Jak-STAT signaling
pathway activation was reportedly upregulated in CML [22],

few studies on its role in leukemia have been

Dynamic miRNA expression at different stages of myeloid
development

K562 expresses a normal erythrocyte surface glycoprotein
pattern [60] and has been characterized as a multipotent hema-
topoietic cell [61] that can spontaneously differentiate into early
progenitors of erythroid, monocyte/macrophage and megak-
aryocytic lineages [62]. The promyeloblast HL-60 is a myeloid
precursor that can be induced in vitro to differentiate into a
number of different cell types, including granulocytes, mono-
cytes, macrophage-like cells and eosinophils [37,63]. Previous

studies [64] and the differential potentials of K562, HL-60
and THP-1 indicate that these cell lines represent three stages
of myeloid differentiation. This differentiation tendency was
evident from the hierarchical clustering via miRNA frequencies
(Table 5). To further investigate whether speciﬁc miRNAs can
regulate myeloid development and cell differentiation, we
examined the miRNA expression patterns in these three
myeloid cell lines and evaluated the relevance of their targets
with respect to myeloid cell differentiation (GO: 0030099)
and its child terms. Two comparisons were made in our dataset:
K562 vs. HL-60 and HL-60 vs. THP-1. In the K562 vs. HL-60
comparison, the downregulated miRNAs in K562 (let-7 family
and miR-17) primarily targeted genes related to erythrocyte dif-
ferentiation (JAK2 encoding Janus kinase 2, GATA2 encoding
GATA binding protein 2 and TAL1 encoding T-cell acute lym-
phocytic leukemia 1) (Table 5), whereas those downregulated in
HL-60, such as miR-27b and miR-214, primarily targeted genes
related to myeloid cell differentiation (e.g., PML and JAG1

identiﬁed in this study, such as miR-185, miR-107, miR-10a
and miR-128, had been reported to be down-regulated during
the induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells [65]. In par-
ticular, expression of the erythroid differentiation-related miR-
NAs miR-155, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-24 was down
regulated in K562 cells, whereas expression of their validated
targets SMAD5, FOXO3 encoding forkhead box O3, KIT
and ACVR1B encoding activin A receptor, type IB was upreg-
ulated [66–70]. Caspase-3 (CASP3), which participates in
erythroid differentiation [71], is a validated target of let-7a
and miR-30d [72,73]. miR-24 was shown to inhibit erythropoi-
esis by targeting the human activin type I receptor ALK4
encoding activin A receptor, type IB [70]. FAS encoding Fas
cell surface death receptor is a target of miR-146a [74], and
JAG1 is a target of miR-143, miR-145, miR-21 and miR-34a
[75,76]; their expression levels during myeloid cell differentia-
tion exhibit opposing patterns. This ﬁnding demonstrated the
dual nature of K562 cells as erythrocytes and multipotent
hematopoietic cells. With respect to HL-60 and THP-1, the
validated target JUN encoding jun proto-oncogene of THP-1-
downregulated miRNAs miR-15a and miR-16 [77] positively
regulated monocyte differentiation, whereas the target HOXA7
of THP-1-upregulated miRNAs miR-196a and miR-196b [78]
negatively regulated monocyte differentiation (Table 5). These
results suggest that miRNAs are important regulators of mye-
loid differentiation and that their expression levels tend to

decrease during myeloid development to allow the expression
of differentiation-promoting genes.

Discussion

In this study, we analyzed the differential miRNA expression
patterns in three human myeloid leukemia cell
lines using
high-throughput parallel sequencing. Our effort to understand
the miRNomes of these three cell lines has provided several
interesting observations, including the identiﬁcation of differ-
entially-expressed miRNAs that represent different myeloid
cell types, distinguish CML from AML cell lines and regulate
myeloid differentiation.

mRNA expression proﬁling facilitates miRNA functional
annotation

In this study,
integrative analyses of miRNA and mRNA
expression proﬁles in the same cell lines allow the functional
deﬁnitions of miRNAs and their putative targets in leukemo-
genesis and myeloid differentiation. This represents an advan-
tage of our work over previous studies [14,24]. To reduce the
false positive rates, we used miRecords [34] to predict the
targets of miRNAs by applying at least four widely-used
tools as well as validated targets identiﬁed during literature
curation. Strictly assigned anti-correlations of miRNA and

Xiong Q et al / miRNomes of AML and CML Cell Lines

87

target expression also reduced the false positive rate. In brief,
every list of miRNAs and mRNAs was determined from the
two sets of pair-wise comparisons (e.g.,
intersections of
Figure 3C) that incorporated the expression data from all
lines. GO-based biological functional enrichment
three cell
and KEGG pathway analysis of
the extracted targets
facilitated the identiﬁcation of putative miRNA functions.
In summary, the approach applied in this study should be
of value for future studies on the functions of miRNAs
[79]. Certainly,
large-scale investigations of miRNA–target
binding via Argonaute CLIP-Seq in corresponding cell lines
would improve prediction reliability [80], and traditional
techniques such as overexpression, reporter assays and site
mutation may be needed in future to verify some of the crit-
ical miRNA–target relationships.

miRNA signatures of distinct myeloid cells

We identiﬁed distinctive miRNAs and targets across all three
myeloid cell
lines. K562 expresses a normal erythrocyte
surface glycoprotein pattern [60] that relies on actin ﬁla-
ment-based processes. We observed that several K562-speciﬁc
miRNAs such as miR-10a, miR-144 and miR-411 participate
in this process by targeting actins, myosins and EPB41 encod-
ing erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1. HL-60 cells exhi-
bit phagocytic activity and response to chemotactic stimuli
[37]. Accordingly, the targets of HL-60-speciﬁc miRNAs are
involved in endocytosis and response to stimuli and thus
exactly match the physiological characteristics of this cell line.
The apoptosis-promoting and cell growth-arresting activities
of two THP-1-unique miRNAs (miR-219-5p and miR-449a)
have been investigated [81,82]; the present study predicted
several genes as targets of
these two miRNAs, possibly
shedding light on the mechanisms by which these miRNAs
regulate apoptosis and cell growth and thus contribute to
the pathogenesis of THP-1 [5]. In summary, cell-speciﬁc
miRNAs harbor unique functions and reﬂect the unique
characteristics of the corresponding cell lines.

Differentially-expressed miRNAs between AML and CML cell
lines

The diagnostic and prognostic signiﬁcances of miRNAs have
been demonstrated in leukemias [9–11,20,21,35]. Many of the
potential targets of miRNAs downregulated in K562 were
enriched in CML pathogenesis-related pathways, while the
potential targets of miRNAs downregulated in AML cell lines
were enriched in AML-related pathways (Table 3). Further-
more, miRNAs could act as tumor suppressors or oncomiRs
through targeting oncogenes or tumor suppressors in AML
or CML pathways (Figure S2). Members of the let-7 family
reportedly act as tumor suppressors in several cancers and leu-
kemias [83,84]. In this study, let-7 family members represented
the most upregulated miRNAs in the AML lines, and they
suppressed the Jak-STAT signaling pathway and PIM
oncogenes to induce apoptosis. Other miRNAs,
including
miR-411, miR-337-3p, miR-625, miR-218 and miR-27b, may
act as tumor suppressors in AML as well. In the CML
pathway, miR-125b and miR-625 functioned as oncomiRs by
suppressors INK4a/ARF (CDKN2A)
targeting the tumor
(Figure S2). Therefore, we can conclude that some of the dif-

ferentially-expressed miRNAs between the AML and CML
lines may distinguish these two myeloid leukemia types and
act as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

miRNAs involved in myeloid differentiation

Our study provided a list of miRNAs that targeted genes
involved in erythroid differentiation (TAL1, JAK2 and
GATA2), myeloid cell differentiation (PML, JAG1 and FAS)
and monocyte differentiation (JUN). In general, upregulated
miRNAs tend to inhibit the differentiation of corresponding
cell lines, whereas downregulated miRNAs support differenti-
ation. miRNAs that control myeloid cell differentiation are
largely unknown, and our results can thus provide some
information in this regard. For example, miR-34a was shown
to target JAG1 in carcinomas [85] and expression of JAG1
was correlated with myeloid cell differentiation. miR-196a
[86] has been shown to target HOXA7 encoding homeobox
A7, whereas miR-15a and miR-16 [77] have been shown to tar-
get JUN; we therefore associated their roles with monocyte
differentiation.

Taken together, our ﬁndings strongly suggest that an
understanding of the molecular biology of myeloid leukemias
will require consideration of both miRNomes and mRNA
transcriptomes. Using this integrated approach, our data from
the three representative cell lines may contribute to subsequent
investigations of speciﬁc miRNAs in leukemia subtyping,
leukemogenesis and myeloid differentiation using a limited
number of samples. However, the small number of cell lines
and the lack of patient samples limited the scientiﬁc signiﬁ-
cance of our study. In future, more leukemia cell lines and
patient samples will be included in miRNA proﬁling analyses
in order to further explore the clinical signiﬁcance of these
miRNAs. Nonetheless, our results can serve as a reference
for future laboratory and clinical studies of myeloid leukemia
miRNAs. Our future interests include the functional annota-
tion of novel miRNAs and experimental validation of the pre-
dicted miRNAs’
in myeloid leukemia. With
validated functions, some of the miRNAs may serve as candi-
dates for the clinical diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of
myeloid leukemias.

Materials and methods

sRNA library construction and sequencing

Cell culture and total RNA extraction were performed as
described previously [22]. RNAs from each sample were run
on denaturing polyacrylamide gels to obtain RNAs of approx-
imately 18–30 nucleotides. These RNAs were then ligated to
sequencing adaptors on both ends and were reversely tran-
scribed using a sRNA sample prep kit (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA). miRNA sequencing was conducted using the
Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GA IIx) platform.

Data processing and differential expression analysis

Sequencing reads were pre-processed prior to reference map-
ping. We used Perl scripts to clip 30-adaptor and 50-adaptor
contaminations and further removed poly (A)-containing or

88

Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 79–91

low-quality reads. The ﬁltered reads were further clustered and
uploaded to DSAP [23], an automated web service that pro-
vides analytical solutions for sRNA sequencing data. The
numbers of reads mapped to individual miRNAs were further
normalized to the CF, which indicates the individual miRNA
abundance relative to the entire miRNA library [14]. Novel
miRNAs were predicted using miRDeep* [29]. The sequencing
read data were uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO; accession No. GSE48059). The location of the miRNAs
was downloaded from BioMart track (GRch37.p10 assembly)
at the Ensembl Genome Browser [87] (http://asia.ensembl.org/
biomart/martview). The raw miRNome data from normal
peripheral blood cells, K562 cells and HL-60 cells, which have
been generated by Vaz et al.
[24], were downloaded and
analyzed as a reference to our data.
Differentially-expressed miRNAs between the samples were
identiﬁed according to the following two criteria: P 6 0.001
and fold change of P2. These were determined using DEGseq
[88], an R software package. We deﬁned leukemia-associated
and differentiation-associated miRNAs from the intersections
of two sets of pair-wise comparisons. In brief, AML-upregu-
lated miRNAs were those that were upregulated in both
HL-60 and THP-1 compared with K562, and UD miRNAs
were upregulated in HL-60 compared with both K562 and
THP-1 (U indicates miRNAs
that were upregulated in
HL-60 relative to K562 and D indicates miRNAs that were
downregulated in THP-1 relative to HL-60). mRNA-seq data
of these cell lines generated previously in our lab are available
in the NCBI GEO data repository (accession No. GSE39374
and GSE46164) and were analyzed similarly.

RT-qPCR

Stem-loop RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate miRNA
expression. In brief, residual DNA was removed from the total
RNA using the TURBO DNA-freeä Kit (Ambion, AM1907,
CA, USA) and a poly (A) tail with ATP was added using poly
(A) polymerase (New England Biolabs). Poly (A)-tailed RNA
was reversely transcribed with the QmiR-RT primer using the
RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scien-
tiﬁc, K1622, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using MaximaÒ SYBR
Green/ROX qPCR Master Mixes (2 ·) (Fermentas, K0223,
MD, USA) and the CFX96ä Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad). Primer pairs comprised a QmiR-speciﬁc
reverse
primers
(sequences were downloaded from miRBase). The data were
analyzed using the 2 DDCt method, and miRNA transcript lev-

miRNA target prediction

The targets of differentially-expressed miRNAs were screened
according to the following criteria: (a) presence in the validated
target list (last updated on April 27, 2013) or prediction by at
least four of the target prediction tools integrated by miRe-
cords [34] and (b) anti-correlation in the expression pattern
between miRNA and mRNA after intersecting the two sets
of pair-wise comparisons [22].

Functional annotation, pathway analysis and network
construction

The gene ontology annotation and KEGG pathways of the
miRNA targets were assigned using DAVID bioinformatics
resources [89]. The genes associated with myeloid cell differen-
tiation (GO: 0030099) and child terms were downloaded from
the AmiGO browser [90]. The networks were presented using
Cytoscape software [91].
