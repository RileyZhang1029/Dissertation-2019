ABSTRACT
Summary: Mauve Contig Mover provides a new method for
proposing the relative order of contigs that make up a draft genome
based on comparison to a complete or draft reference genome.
A novel application of the Mauve aligner and viewer provides an
automated reordering algorithm coupled with a powerful drill-down
display allowing detailed exploration of results.

1 INTRODUCTION
New high-throughput technologies have greatly reduced the cost
of genome sequencing, leading to an abundance of draft-quality
genome sequences that may be composed of hundreds or thousands
of contigs. Ordering and orienting these contigs into larger
units (scaffolds or supercontigs) facilitates genome closure and
comparative analyses. Contigs can be ordered based on additional
data, such as the presence of discontinuous portions of the same
sequencing template (clone or fragment) in two contigs, but this
type of information is not available for all projects. However, even
without additional data, contig order can be predicted by comparison
with a reference genome that is expected to have conserved genome
organization.

We present a new method for comparative contig ordering based
on iterative genome alignment using Mauve. The reference used
may be draft quality itself, or may have divergent genetic content.
The Mauve aligner has been used extensively for microbial genome
comparisons because it effectively identiﬁes and aligns homologous
regions even if genomes have undergone rearrangements, large
insertions or deletions, and substantial sequence divergence. Mauve
Contig Mover (MCM) provides advantages over methods that rely
on matches in limited regions near the ends of contigs, require
anchors at both ends of contigs, force users to exclude lineage-
speciﬁc sequences at contig boundaries, or are unable to resolve
which, if any, copies of repeated sequences are consistent with
more extensive collinearity (Darling et al., 2004; Richter et al.,
2007; van Hijum et al., 2005). An interactive full-genome alignment
display shows the relative order of the contigs as well as potential

gaps in sequence coverage and regions of possible rearrangement or
misassembly. After reordering, Mauve is a useful platform for further
detailed comparative sequence analysis that is often the motivation
for the sequencing effort itself.

2 METHODS
The Mauve aligner ﬁlters and sorts internally identiﬁed matches into locally
collinear blocks (LCBs). Each LCB represents a region of homologous
sequence without rearrangement among the input genomes. Each LCB must
be separated from the next by rearrangement in at least one genome (Darling
et al., 2004). Contig boundaries (edges) represent potentially artiﬁcial LCB
edges. Therefore, ﬁnding the contig order that minimizes the number of
LCBs caused by contig edges is equivalent to ﬁnding a likely contig order.
Using the Mauve alignment LCBs, the reordering process occurs in three
steps: placing contigs with no apparent conﬂict in ordering information,
placing contigs with conﬂicting information into intermediary anchor
positions, and ﬁnally matching LCB ends that extend to contig boundaries.
Each step occurs in at most O(n2) time, where n is the number of LCBs,
plus the time required for alignment (Darling et al., 2004). Mauve assumes
contigs are in the correct order when ﬁltering matches, so as the order is
optimized, alignment results change. Therefore, results are reﬁned through
iterative alignment until no further ordering is possible.

MCM outputs a series of Mauve alignments, each representing an iteration
of the reordering. In addition to the standard Mauve output, the reorder
process produces a FastA ﬁle containing the new order and orientation, as
well as a list of ordered contigs including name and coordinate location. The
standard Mauve visualization can be applied in novel ways to analyze contig
order. For example, we have used it to identify potential misassemblies in
contigs, and to evaluate the presence or absence of genes split by contig
boundaries or by rearrangements. If FastAs representing the order produced
by other programs are created, Mauve can also be used to compare results, as
in Supplementary Figure 1. Furthermore, annotations from GenBank format
input can be viewed, even once reordered.

3 RESULTS
We have used MCM to order contigs for a variety of different
bacterial genome projects based on comparison to the single best
reference sequence available, and show some of our results in
Table 1. These projects include draft genomes assembled from
Sanger sequencing as well as short read generating technologies
developed by 454 and Illumina, with the most fragmented example
involving a 5 Mb genome with more than 1000 contigs. The draft
and reference genome combinations selected include comparisons of
genomes from different species, the same species, different strains

Data includes the draft sequence and reference sequence used to perform the order, the number of contigs and base pairs contained in the draft, and the number of contigs and
percentage of base pairs ordered by Mauve, Projector (van Hijum et al., 2005), and OSLay (Richter et al., 2007). Pectobacterium is abbreviated P. in table. All drafts were sequenced
using 454 technology, except (*), which used Solexa. While we included numbers from OSLay reorders, the structure suggested by the OSLay reorder differs signiﬁcantly from
that of Mauve and Projector, as can be seen in Supplementary Figure 1. Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1 also summarize correctly ordered quantities based on artiﬁcially cut
genomes.

Each row is an average of the orders of the same sequences listed below in Supplementary Table 2. The draft, in each case, was artiﬁcially cut into pieces using in-house software.
The pieces were ordered using Mauve, Projector and OSLay, and the results compared to the correct order. A piece (contig) was considered out of order if it was out of position
relative to the closest correctly ordered contig on either side. The table shows the total number of base pairs, the percentage ordered using each algorithm, and the percent of the
total base pairs that were correctly ordered. Draft sequences are prone to errors and omissions that have not been modeled in the artiﬁcially partitioned ‘drafts’ used. Therefore,
these ﬁgures are meant to bound the number of ordered base pairs. Each row represents different genomes with different divergence, giving an idea of these percentages over a
range of data.

and different assemblies of the same genome. Many of the draft
genomes available through the Enteropathogen Resource Integration
Center (Glasner et al., 2008a) and the ASAP database (Glasner et
al., 2006) have been ordered using MCM. Examples are available
as Supplementary Material on our web site. Supplementary Figure
1 shows a Yersinia pestis strain FV1 draft genome (Touchman et al.,
2007) reordered and aligned to the completeY. pestis CO92 reference
genome. MCM was able to order 356 out of 400 contigs (4211103
out of 4472646 bp) reducing the alignment from 359 to 11 LCBs.
Supplementary Figure 1 also shows the utility of the Mauve Viewer
for comparing different suggested contig orders.

We urge caution in interpretation of contig order predicted
using MCM or any other algorithm. Many true bacterial genome
rearrangements occur at repetitive sequences, which pose challenges
for both genome assembly and alignment. Ordering contigs based
on comparative analyses can mask true rearrangements anchored in
repeats at these contig breaks. Annotations of complete and partial
repeats can be viewed in the Mauve alignment display, providing
a means of identifying such regions. Conversely, misassemblies
can appear as false rearrangements. Mauve clearly displays these
regions, and PCR primers may be designed that allows veriﬁcation
of the rearrangement or proof of the misassembly. The Mauve
Viewer also allows exploration of alternate positions for contigs
with multiple LCBs. A comparison of the number of LCBs between

reference and draft to the number between other genomes expected
to show similar levels of rearrangement can provide an estimate
of this effect. Table 2 summarizes reorders without modeling these
effects, showing accuracy between 90.4% and 99.4%. Generally,
closer alignments will provide more accurate reorders covering
more of the draft. Because MCM maximizes collinearity among
genome sequences under comparison it produces alignments that
are easily visualized and provides an excellent platform for analysis
and ﬁnishing of draft genomes.
