ABSTRACT
Motivation: Networks are widely used as structural summaries of bio-
chemical systems. Statistical estimation of networks is usually based
on linear or discrete models. However, the dynamics of biochemical
systems are generally non-linear, suggesting that suitable non-linear
formulations may offer gains with respect to causal network inference
and aid in associated prediction problems.
Results: We present a general framework for network inference and
dynamical prediction using time course data that is rooted in non-
linear biochemical kinetics. This is achieved by considering a dynam-
ical system based on a chemical reaction graph with associated
kinetic parameters. Both the graph and kinetic parameters are treated
as unknown; inference is carried out within a Bayesian framework.
This allows prediction of dynamical behavior even when the underlying
reaction graph itself is unknown or uncertain. Results, based on (i) data
simulated from a mechanistic model of mitogen-activated protein
kinase signaling and (ii) phosphoproteomic data from cancer cell
lines, demonstrate that non-linear formulations can yield gains in
causal network inference and permit dynamical prediction and uncer-
tainty quantification in the challenging setting where the reaction graph
is unknown.

1 INTRODUCTION

Statistical network inference techniques are widely used in the
analysis of multivariate biochemical data (Ellis and Wong, 2008;
Sachs et al., 2005). These techniques aim to make inferences re-
garding a network N whose vertices are identified with biomole-
cular components (e.g. genes or proteins) and edges with (direct
or indirect) regulatory interplay between those components.

Network inference methods are typically rooted in linear or
discrete models whose statistical and computational advantages
facilitate exploration of large spaces of networks (e.g. Ellis and
Wong, 2008; Maathuis et al., 2009; Werhli et al., 2006). On the
other hand, when the network topology is known, non-linear
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to
model biochemical dynamics (Chen et al., 2009; Kholodenko,
2006). The intermediate case where ODE models are used to
select between candidate networks has received less attention.

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We propose a general framework called ‘Chemical Model
Averaging’ (CheMA) that uses biochemical ODE models to
carry out both network inference and dynamical prediction. In
summary, we consider a dynamical system dX=dt=fGðX; Þ
where the state vector X contains the abundances of molecular
species, G is a chemical reaction graph that characterizes reac-
tions in the system, fG is a kinetic model that depends on G, and 
collects together all unknown kinetic parameters. A causal net-
work N is obtained as a coarse summary N(G) of the reaction
graph G in which each chemical species appears as a single node,
and directed edges indicate that the parent is involved in chem-
ical reaction(s), which have the child as product (we make these
notions precise below). Given time course data D consisting of
noisy measurements of X, we carry out inference and prediction
within a Bayesian framework. In particular, we treat G itself as
unknown and make inference concerning it using the posterior
distribution,

The statistical connection between linear ODEs and network
inference using linear models has been discussed in Oates and
Mukherjee (2012) and exploited in Bansal et al. (2006), Gardner
et al. (2003). Several approaches based on non-linear ODEs have
been proposed, including €Aij€o and L€ahdesm€aki (2010); Honkela
et al. (2010); Nachman et al. (2004); Nelander et al. (2008). This
article extends these ideas by formulating a Bayesian approach to
both network inference and dynamical prediction that is rooted
in chemical kinetics. Bayesian model selection based on non-
linear ODEs has been shown to be a promising strategy for

elucidation of specific signaling mechanisms (e.g. Xu et al., 2010).
Our work differs in motivation and approach in that we exploit
automatically generated rather than hand-crafted biochemical
models,
thereby allowing full network inference without
manual specification of candidate models. Oates et al. (2012)
performed Bayesian model selection by comparing steady-state
data with equilibrium solutions of automatically generated ODE
models. This article extends this approach to time course data
and prediction of dynamics.

There are several considerations that motivate CheMA: (i)
inference in biological systems is complicated by correlations be-
tween components that are co-regulated but not causally linked.
It is well known that, under a linear formulation, the causal
network N is in general unidentifiable (Pearl, 2009). For ex-
ample, it may not be possible to orient certain edges, or edges
may be inferred between co-regulated nodes due to strong asso-
ciations between them. Non-linear kinetic equations, in contrast,
are able to confer asymmetries between nodes and may be suffi-
cient to enable orientation of edges (Peters et al., 2011), although
we note that causal
inference using non-linear models still
requires a number of strong assumptions (Pearl, 2009). As a
consequence, CheMA can in principle aid in causal network in-
ference, and empirical results below support this. (ii) In contrast
to linear models, in CheMA, the mechanistic roles of individual
variables are respected. This facilitates analysis of data obtained
under specific molecular interventions and enhances scientific
interpretability. (iii) Prediction of dynamical behavior (e.g. re-
sponse to a stimulus or to a drug treatment) in general depends
on the chemical reaction graph. In settings where the graph itself
is unknown or uncertain (e.g. due to genetic or epigenetic con-
text), CheMA allows prediction of dynamics by averaging over
an ensemble of (automatically generated) candidate reaction
graphs.

The CheMA framework is general and can in principle be used
in many settings where kinetic formulations are available to de-
scribe the dynamics, including gene regulation, metabolism and
protein signaling. For definiteness, in this article, we focus on
protein signaling networks mediated by phosphorylation and
provide a specific implementation of the general framework.
Phosphorylation kinetics have been widely studied (Kholodenko,
2006), and ODE formulations are available,
including those
based on Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Leskovac, 2003).

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First, we
introduce the model and associated statistical
formulation.
Second, we discuss network inference and dynamical prediction
within this framework. Third, we show empirical results, on
simulated and experimental data, comparing CheMA 1.0 with
several existing approaches. Finally, we discuss our findings and
suggest several directions for further work.

2 METHODS

Below we describe a first implementation of the CheMA framework,
called CheMA 1.0, for the specific context of protein phosphorylation
networks. Figure 1 provides an outline of the workflow below.

2.1 Automatic generation of reaction graphs G
We construct reaction graphs for p proteins fX1 . . . Xpg=V. Each Xi can

Fig. 1. CheMA. Chemical reaction graphs G summarize interplay that is
described quantitatively by kinetic equations fG. Candidate graphs G are
scored against observed time course data D in a Bayesian framework. A
network N gives a coarse summary of the system; marginal posterior
probabilities of edges in N quantify evidence in favor of causal relation-
ships. The reaction graph G (and N) is treated as an unknown, latent
object and the methodology allows Bayesian prediction of dynamics
(including under intervention) in the unknown graph setting

i are catalyzed by enzymes E 2 Ei;

Phosphorylation reactions Xi ! X
the subscript indicates that each protein may have a specific set of en-
zymes (kinases). We consider the case in which the kinases themselves are
phosphorylated proteins, i.e. Ei  V (if phosphorylation of Xi is not
driven by an enzyme in V, we set Ei=1). For simplicity, we do not
consider multiple phosphorylation sites, other post-translational modifi-
cations (e.g. ubiquitinylation), protein degradation or spatial effects. The
ability of enzyme E 2 Ei to catalyze phosphorylation of Xi may be in-
hibited by proteins I 2 I i;E  V; the double subscript indicates that in-
hibition is specific to both target Xi and enzyme E (see below).
The reaction graph G provides a visual representation of the sets
Ei and I i;E; Figure 1 shows an illustrative example on three proteins A,
B and C. A causal biological network N(G) is formed by drawing
exactly p vertices and edges (i, j) indicating that X
is either an enzyme
catalyzing phosphorylation of Xj, or an inhibitor of such an enzyme.
That is, ði; jÞ 2 N , i 2 Ej _ 9E  i 2 I j;E. For the example shown in
the directed graph

the corresponding network N is

i

2.2 Automatic generation of kinetic models fG
The reaction graph G can be decomposed into local graphs Gi describing
enzymes (and their inhibitors) for phosphorylation of protein Xi. For
simplicity of exposition, we consider inference concerning Gi. Thus, Xi
plays the role of the substrate; following conventional notation in enzyme
kinetics, we refer to Xi using the symbol S and use [] to denote concen-
tration of the chemical species indicated by the argument.

We use kinetic models fG based on Michaelis–Menten functionals
(Leskovac, 2003). Here we restrict attention to a relatively simple model
class, but more complex dynamics could be incorporated. The rate of
phosphorylation due to kinase E is given by VE½E½Sh=ð½Sh+Kh
EÞ,
which acknowledges variation of kinase concentration [E] and permits
kinase-specific response profiles, parameterized by KE and h, with rate
constant VE. Below, the Hill coefficient h is taken equal to 1 (non-coopera-
tive binding). We consider competitive inhibition, where substrate and
inhibitor
the same binding site on the enzyme
(EI Ð E Ð ES ! E+S). When multiple inhibitors are present, they
are assumed to act exclusively, competing for the same binding site on

able to automate the generation of candidate parametric ODE models.

2.3 Model averaging and the network N
Evidence for a causal influence of protein i on protein j is summarized by
the marginal posterior probability of a directed edge (i, j) in the network
N. This is obtained by averaging over all possible reaction graphs G, as

pðði; jÞ 2 NjDÞ=

ð3Þ

G

We note that while the marginal posterior in Equation (3) is an intuitive
summary, the full posterior over reaction graphs G is also available
for more detailed exploration. In the same vein, model averaging is
used to compute posterior predictive distributions (see Supplementary
Material).

Following work in structural inference for graphical models (Ellis and
Wong, 2008), we bound graph in-degree; in particular, we consider only
those sets of kinases ES  V that satisfy jESj  c1, and similarly, we
bound the number of inhibitors jI S;Ej  c2 (see Section 3.1 below).

Bayesian variable selection requires multiplicity correction to control
the false discovery rate and avoid degeneracy (Scott and Berger, 2010).
For phosphorylation networks, we achieve multiplicity correction using a
prior p(G) uniform over the number of kinases, and for a given kinase,
uniform over the number of kinase inhibitors:

We note that the above prior does not include biological knowledge
concerning specific edges; informative structural priors are also available
in the literature (Mukherjee and Speed, 2008).

dynamics via ‘gradient matching’. We follow €Aij€o and L€ahdesm€aki
(2010); Bansal et al. (2006); Oates and Mukherjee (2012) and use a
simple Euler scheme that approximates the gradient dXi=dt at time tj
by ziðtjÞ=ðy
i ðtj 1ÞÞ=ðtj   tj 1Þ. We note that more accurate ap-
proximations could be used, at the cost of requiring more data points or
additional modeling assumptions (see Section 4). The ODE model fG;S
[Equation (2)] is formulated as a statistical model by constructing, con-
ditional upon (unknown) Michaelis–Menten parameters K, a design

where zS=½zSðt1Þ; . . . ; zSðtnÞT; N denotes a normal density, 2 the noise
variance, I the identity matrix and, as above, V is the vector of maximum
reaction rates. The appropriateness of normality, additivity and the
uncorrelatedness of errors necessarily depends on the data generating
and measurement processes, as well as the time intervals tj   tj 1 between
consecutive observations, as discussed in Oates and Mukherjee (2012).
This approximation has the crucial advantage of rendering the local re-
action graphs GS statistically orthogonal, such that each may be esti-
mated independently (see Hill et al., 2012). Iterating over S 2 V permits
inference concerning the complete reaction graph G.

information on truncated normals

2.4.2 MCMC and marginal likelihoods CheMA 1.0 uses truncated
normal priors N Tð; SÞ with parameters ; S inherited from the corres-
ponding untruncated distribution. Truncation ensures non-negativity of
parameters, while normality facilitates partial conjugacy (see below); add-
itional
is provided in the
Supplementary Material. To simplify notation, we consider a specific
variable S and candidate model GS and omit the subscript in what fol-
lows. To elicit hyperparameters ; S, we follow Xu et al. (2010) and
assume all processes occur on observable time and concentration scales,
that is V; K  Oð1Þ, reflecting that the data are normalized a priori.
For prior covariance of Michaelis–Menten parameters SK, we assume
independence of the components Ki, so that pðKÞ=N TðK; K; IÞ,
where K;  are hyperparameters. For the prior covariance SV of max-
imum reaction rates, we take a unit information formulation of the trun-
so that pðVjK; Þ=N TðV; V; n2ðD0DÞ 1Þ where
cated g-prior,
D=DG;SðKÞ is the design matrix defined above. This implies that the
prior contributes (approximately) the same amount of information as
one data point, as recommended by Kass and Wasserman (1995), and
automatically selects the scale of the prior covariance (see Zellner, 1986).
For the noise parameter, we use a Jeffreys prior pðÞ / 1=. These latter
choices render the formulation partially conjugate, permitting an efficient
Metropolis-within-Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
scheme for the parameter posterior distribution, as described in detail in
the Supplementary Material.

To estimate marginal likelihoods from sampler output, we exploit par-
tial conjugacy and use the method of Chib and Jeliazkov (2001). As
inference in CheMA 1.0 decomposes over proteins Xi 2 V, and for a
given protein, over local models Gi, the computations were parallelized
(full details and software provided as Supplementary Material).
Alternatively, MCMC could be used over the discrete space of reaction
graphs (Ellis and Wong, 2008) or the joint space of graphs and param-
eters (Oates et al., 2012).

2.4.3 Interventions on the system In interventional experiments,
data are obtained under treatments that externally influence network
edges or nodes. Inhibitors of protein phosphorylation are now increas-
ingly available; such inhibitors typically bind to the kinase domain of
their target, preventing enzymatic activity. We consider such inhibitors
in biological experiments below. Within CheMA 1.0, we model inhibition
by setting to zero those terms in the design matrix DG;S corresponding to
the inhibited enzyme E in the treated samples (‘perfect certain’ interven-
tions in the terminology of Eaton and Murphy, 2007; Spencer et al.,
2012). This removes the causal influence of E for the inhibited samples.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Hyperparameter specification and sensitivity
For CheMA 1.0, we set hyperparameters V=K=1; =1=2
and the maximum in-degree constraint c1=2; we investigated
sensitivity by varying these parameters within (i) a toy model
of signaling (Supplementary Fig. S3a–c) and (ii) in a subset of
the simulations reported below (Supplementary Fig. S2). As the
action of inhibition is second order in the Taylor expansion
sense, inference for inhibitor variables I S;E may be expected to
require substantially more data,
in line with the ‘weak
identifiability’ of second-order terms reported in Calderhead
and Girolami (2011). A preliminary investigation based on a
toy model of signaling revealed that at typical sample sizes in-
sets I S;E was extremely challenging
ference for
(Supplementary Fig. S3d). Combined with computational con-
siderations, we decided to fix c2=0 for subsequent experiments;
that is, we did not include inhibitory regulation in the reaction
graph. Further diagnostics, including MCMC convergence, are
presented in the Supplementary Material.

In silico MAPK pathway

Data were generated from a mechanistic model of the MAPK
signaling pathway described by Xu et al. (2010), specified by a
system of 25 ODEs of Michaelis–Menten type whose reaction
graph is shown in Figure 2a. This archetypal protein signaling
system provides an ideal test bed, as the causal graph is known,
and the model has been validated against experimentally ob-
tained data (Xu et al., 2010). Following Oates and Mukherjee
(2012), the Xu et al. model was transformed into a stochastic
differential equation with intrinsic noise . Full details of the
simulation setup appear in Supplementary Material.

For inference of the network N(G), we compared our ap-
proach with existing network inference methods that are com-
(i) ‘1-penalized regression
patible with time course data:
time series network identification (‘TSNI’;
(‘LASSO’),

(ii)

regression with model averaging (‘GP’;

Bansal et al. 2006; this is based on ‘2-penalized regression), (iii)
dynamic Bayesian networks (‘DBN’; Hill et al., 2012), (iv) time-
varying DBNs (Dondelinger et al., 2012) and (v) Gaussian pro-
€Aij €o and
cess
L€ahdesm€aki, 2010). Approaches (i–iii) are based on linear differ-
ence equations; (iv) relaxes the linear assumption in a piecewise
fashion, whereas (v) is a semiparametric variable selection tech-
nique. We note that because TSNI cannot deal with multiple
time courses, we adapted it for use in this setting. Implementa-
tion details for all methods may be found in the Supplementary
Material.

To systematically assess estimation of network structure, we
computed the average area under the precision-recall (AUPR)
and area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC)
curves. Figure 2b shows mean AUPR for all approaches, for 20
regimes of sample size n and noise . CheMA 1.0 performs con-
sistently well in all regimes, and outperforms (i–v) substantially
at the larger sample sizes. It is interesting to note that the linear
and piecewise linear DBNs (iii–iv) perform better at moderate
sample sizes compared with higher sample sizes, possibly because
of model misspecification. AUROC results (Supplementary
Fig. S6) showed a broadly similar pattern, with CheMA 1.0
offering gains at larger sample sizes. For the kinetic parameters,
however, we found that CheMA 1.0 struggled to precisely re-
cover the true values =fV; Kg, even when the reaction graph
G was known (Fig. 3). The posterior distribution over rate con-
stants V was much more informative than the posterior distribu-
tion over Michaelis–Menten parameters K, consistent with
the ‘weak identifiability’ of kinase inhibitors that we found in
Section 3.1.

To investigate dynamical prediction in the setting where nei-

data from an unseen intervention and assessed ability to predict
the resulting dynamics (details of the simulation are included in
the Supplementary Material). To fix a length scale, both true and
predicted trajectories were normalized by maximum protein

Figure 4a displays predictions for the dynamics that result from

prediction, whereas the linear analogue rapidly diverges to infin-
ity (due to poorly estimated eigenvalues). Therefore, we focused
only on short-term prediction, specifically the first 25% of the
time course, for which linear models may yet prove useful. Over
all simulation regimes and experiments,
including at small
sample sizes, we found that our approach produced significa-
ntly lower MSE than both the linear and benchmark mo-
dels (MSECheMA 1:0=0:061; MSELin:=2:55; MSEBench:=0:199).
Furthermore, CheMA 1.0 consistently produced lowest MSE
fixed values of n and  (Supplementary Fig. S10;

Next, we considered experimental data obtained using reverse-
phase protein arrays (Hennessy et al., 2010) from 15 human
breast cancer cell lines, of which 10 were of HER2+ subtype
(Neve et al., 2006). These data comprised observations for key
phosphoproteins AKT, EGFR, MEK, GSK3ab, S6, 4EBP1 and
their unphosphoryated counterparts. Data were acquired under
pretreatment with inhibitors Lapatinib (‘EGFRi’; an EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor), GSK690693 (‘AKTi’; an AKT inhibitor) and
without inhibition (DMSO) at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h following
serum stimulation, giving n = 15 observations of each species
in each cell line (see Supplementary Material for full experimen-
tal protocol).

Assessment of inferred network topologies for the cell lines is
challenging because the true cell line-specific networks are not
known. Inferred topologies partially agree with known signaling
(Supplementary Fig. S11), but the latter is based mainly on stu-
dies using wild-type cells and may not reflect networks in genet-
ically perturbed cancer lines. Therefore, to assess performance,
we also considered the problem of prediction of trajectories
under an unseen intervention, where objective assessment is pos-
sible. We sought to compare performance of CheMA 1.0 against
a literature-based ODE model (reaction graph G fixed according
to literature and dynamics fG as described above) fitted to train-
ing data. No prior information concerning specific chemical
reactions was provided to CheMA 1.0. This problem is highly
non-trivial because of the small sample size, uneven sampling
times and the complex observation process associated with prote-
omic assay data.

Training on DMSO and EGFRi (or AKTi) data, we assessed
ability to predict the full dynamic response to AKT (or EGFR)
inhibition. In this way, each held-out test set contained trajec-
tories under a completely unseen intervention. By considering all
15 cell lines, giving 30 held-out datasets, we found that in 19 of
30 prediction problems CheMA 1.0 outperformed the literature
predictor (Fig. 4b). As expected (and as in the case of the simu-
lated data), the linear model was not well behaved for prediction
(Supplementary Fig. S12) and is not shown. In the AKTi test, of
the 10 HER2+ cell lines, 9 were better predicted by CheMA 1.0
compared with literature prediction (P = 0.01, binomial test;
MSECheMA 1:0=0:064 versus MSELit:=0:274). Conversely, four
of
five HER2– lines were better predicted by literature
(MSELit:=0:145 versus MSECheMA 1:0=0:240), suggesting that
signaling network topology in HER2+ lines may differ to the
(wild type) literature topology, in line with the literature on the
cell lines (Neve et al., 2006). This is encouraging from the per-
spective of CheMA, as a priori it is far from clear whether the
training data, which involved only P = 6 species and n = 10 data
points, contain sufficient information to predict the effect of an
unseen intervention, even approximately. However, in two of the
failure cases (HCC 1569, HCC 1954; EGFRi test) CheMA 1.0
produced extremely poor predictions (MSECheMA 1:041), likely
because of the small training sample size.

4 DISCUSSION

We proposed a general framework for using chemical kinetics in
network inference and dynamical prediction. The use of chemical
kinetics can be expected to contribute gains in causal inference
because the underlying models are not structurally symmetric,
allowing causal directionality to be established (Peters et al.,
2011). In empirical results, we found that while CheMA 1.0
struggled to identify kinetic parameters from data, it was never-
theless able to identify the causal network; this discrepancy is
explained by the fact that the latter is in a sense a projection
of the former, and can be identifiable even when the full set of
parameters are not.

An important challenge in systems biology is to predict the
effect on signaling of a novel intervention, such as a drug treat-
ment. At present, dynamical predictions in systems biology re-
quire a known chemical reaction graph, for instance, taken from
the literature; a system of ODEs is usually specified based on

CheMA 1.0

such a graph and used for prediction. However, in many settings,
the chemical reaction graph may differ depending on cell type or
disease state and cannot be assumed known. In contrast, CheMA
shows how prediction of dynamical behavior may be possible
even when the reaction graph itself is unknown a priori.
Unlike more convenient linear or discrete formulations, our
use of chemical kinetic models provides interpretable predictions.
For example, the dynamic behavior of phosphoprotein concen-
trations obtained under chemical kinetic rate laws is physically
plausible (i.e. smooth, bounded and non-negative). Furthermore,
by averaging predictions over reaction graphs, our approach
should provide robustness in (typical) situations where it is un-
reasonable to expect to identify G precisely. Nevertheless, pre-
diction of trajectories based on the protein data was challenging,
likely because of noise and small sample sizes (Supplementary
Fig. S13). We anticipate that continuing technical advances will
move high-throughput proteomics closer to the favorable simu-
lation regimes in Section 3.2 on which we found the richer non-
linear models to be useful.

Several improvements can be made to the CheMA 1.0 imple-
mentation reported here, of which we highlight two: (i) gradient
matching (rather than numerical solution of the automatically
generated dynamical systems) can help to relieve the computa-
tional demands associated with exploration the large model
spaces, but the Euler approximations we used for this purpose
are crude. Improved gradient matching should be possible (at the
expense of requiring more time points) via higher-order expan-
sions, or (at the expense of additional modeling assumptions)
kernel
the penalized likelihood approaches of
Gonzalez et al. (2013); Ramsay et al. (2007), or the Bayesian
approach of Dondelinger et al. (2013). (ii) CheMA 1.0 does
not explicitly distinguish between process noise and observation
noise; an interesting direction for further research would be to
incorporate an explicit observation model.

regression,

Two ongoing challenges in Bayesian computation relevant to
CheMA include inference of model parameters and computation
of marginal likelihoods for model selection. The second is an
active area of research, with candidate approaches including
variational approximations (Rue et al., 2009) and MCMC
(Vyshemirsky and Girolami, 2008). In general, the computa-
tional burden of CheMA will be higher than many methods
(see Supplementary Material). By way of illustration, Bayesian
inference and prediction for a system of 27 protein species re-
quired over 12 h (serial) computational time. In contrast, linear
or discrete models offer better scalability to high-dimensional
settings. Thus, CheMA can complement existing methodologies
but is not at present applicable to truly high-dimensional prob-
lems with hundreds or thousands of nodes.

Finally, we note the following caveats: (i) the automatic gen-
eration of kinetic equations limits the extent to which detailed
knowledge about particular biochemical processes and dynamics
may be incorporated. (ii) Our empirical results suggest that more
complex interactions, including kinase inhibition, can be ex-
tremely difficult to identify in practice. (iii) The form of kinetics
used here will likely be suboptimal when the assumptions of the
Michaelis–Menten approximation are violated. (iv) Larger train-
ing and test datasets may be needed to allow truly effective
trajectory prediction and
assessment of
performance.
