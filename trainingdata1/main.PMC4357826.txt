Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common adult primary tumor of the cen-
tral nervous system. The current standard of care for glioblastoma patients involves a combination
of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide. Several mech-
anisms underlying the inherent and acquired temozolomide resistance have been identiﬁed and con-
tribute to treatment failure. Early identiﬁcation of temozolomide-resistant GBM patients and
improvement of the therapeutic strategies available to treat this malignancy are of uttermost impor-
tance. This review initially looks at the molecular pathways underlying GBM formation and devel-
opment with a particular emphasis placed on recent therapeutic advances made in the ﬁeld. Our
focus will next be directed toward the molecular mechanisms modulating temozolomide resistance
in GBM patients and the strategies envisioned to circumvent this resistance. Finally, we highlight
the diagnostic and prognostic value of metabolomics in cancers and assess its potential usefulness
in improving the current standard of care for GBM patients.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent and
aggressive primary brain tumor [1]. It accounts for approxi-

mately 60% of all primary brain gliomas diagnosed yearly in
the United States [2]. Although early symptoms associated
with GBMs depend on location, size and rate of growth of
the tumor, 30–60% of patients experience headaches and sei-
zures [3]. Despite recent progresses in the molecular character-
ization of GBMs, median survival time of patients suffering
from GBMs remains between 12 and 15 months [4,5]. Current
standard of care to treat GBM patients consists of surgical
resection followed by a regimen that includes radiotherapy
plus concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment
with temozolomide (TMZ) [6,7]. TMZ is a DNA alkylating
agent of the imidazotetrazine class that can effectively cross
the blood–brain barrier [8]. Researchers have started to

uncover mechanisms that underlie TMZ resistance to GBMs.
These include the enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-
transferase (MGMT)
from
DNA, as well as the DNA mismatch repair cascades capable
of repairing mispaired DNA bases [9,10]. Yet, the complete
molecular picture associated with TMZ resistance in GBMs re-
mains elusive and the development of novel approaches to
characterize the metabolic footprint of GBMs is of great inter-
est. In this review, we present the deregulated pathways in-
volved in GBM formation and progression, focus on the
mechanisms underlying TMZ resistance in GBMs and discuss
metabolomics-based approaches that could be leveraged in the
quest to improve the current therapeutic outcomes in GBMs.

Glioblastomas: a molecular overview

GBMs are grade IV gliomas and arise either de novo as pri-
mary GBMs or through progressive development from lower
grade astrocytomas, which ultimately leads to secondary
GBMs [11]. Molecular proﬁling has revealed deregulated core
signaling pathways that confer GBM formation and progres-
sion [12]. In addition, a study of gene signatures expressed in
GBMs highlighted four distinct subtypes: proneural, neural,
classical and mesenchymal [13]. A well-characterized molecu-
lar event is ampliﬁcation of the gene encoding epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), which occurs in approxi-
mately 50% of primary GBMs [14]. Moreover, 20–30% of
GBM patients express a shortened and constitutively active
version of EGFR, EGFRvIII, which no longer requires inter-
action with its ligand EGF to activate downstream signaling
cascades such as the PI3K/Akt pathway [15,16]. Genes coding
for other receptor tyrosine kinases, including the platelet-de-
rived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA) and the proto-onco-
gene (MET), are ampliﬁed to various degrees in GBMs,
resulting in the modulation of proliferative and survival path-
ways [17,18]. Increased levels of the MDM2 and CDK4 onco-
genes via chromosome 12q13-15 ampliﬁcation are also of note
in GBMs [19]. On the other hand, mutations of PTEN and
p53, genes coding for two proteins with tumor suppressive
capabilities, are frequent occurrences in GBMs [20]. Modiﬁca-
tions in PTEN and p53 expression contribute to sustained acti-
vation of the PI3K/Akt signaling axis and to evasion of
programmed cell death, respectively [21,22]. Furthermore, epi-
genetic
including
CDKN2A, CDKN2B, PTEN, RB1 and p53, via hypermethyla-
tion is common in GBMs [23].

(miRNAs)

implications of microRNAs

Aside from the gene modulation and epigenetic regulation,
in
the potential
GBMs should not be overlooked [24,25]. MiRNAs are small
(18–24 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that act as post-tran-
scriptional modulators of gene expression and thus play cru-
cial roles in regulating different cellular processes [26]. Several
miRNAs with oncogenic potential, or oncomiRs, emerge as
underlying drivers of various malignancies including GBMs.
miR-26a, which targets PTEN and RB1 tumor suppressors,
is frequently coampliﬁed with CDK4 in GBMs [27]. Expres-
sion of miR-21, another known regulator of PTEN protein
expression, is frequently up-regulated in human GBM sam-
ples [28], while antiproliferative effect of miR-21 silencing
has been reported in GBM cells [29]. Down-regulation of tu-
mor suppressor miRNAs has also been identiﬁed in GBMs.

For example, expression of miR-7, which inhibits EGFR
and Akt pathway activities by interacting with key transcript
targets within these cascades, was frequently down-regulated
in GBMs [30]. Expression of miR-34a, a transcriptional tar-
get of p53, is frequently down-regulated in cancer including
GBMs. More importantly, expression levels of miR-34a were
inversely correlated with protein levels of MET and Notch in
gliomas [31].

Overall, either through ampliﬁcation of selected receptor
tyrosine kinases,
loss of molecules with tumor suppressive
properties or modulation of a family of oncogenic miRNAs,
numerous signaling cascades are driving GBMs.

The current standard of care for GBM treatment combines
surgical resection, radiotherapy and adjuvant TMZ treatment,
leading to increased median survival time [6]. However, the
5-year survival rate remains considerably low either for TMZ
treatment combined with radiotherapy or for radiotherapy
alone (9.8% vs 1.9%) after surgery [7]. The mechanism of ac-
tion and challenges associated with this chemotherapeutic
agent will be discussed in the next section. Other FDA-ap-
proved therapeutic approaches for GBMs include 1,3-bis (2-
chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers. This method is
based on controlled release delivery of carmustine from biode-
gradable polymer wafers deposited in the tumor cavity upon
tumor removal [32]. A meta-analysis of phase III trials re-
vealed that BCNU wafers increased overall survival of primary
malignant glioma patients by 2.2 months (13.1 vs 10.9 months)
[33]. NovoTTF-100A, a noninvasive electrode system that gen-
erates pulsating electric ﬁelds and induces apoptosis [34], has
been recently approved by FDA. While NovoTTF-100A pro-
vides beneﬁts over TMZ treatment including negligible side-ef-
fects, a recent study comparing the two approaches indicated
that the method was at best comparable to TMZ in terms of
survival rate [35]. The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab
has also garnered interest as a therapeutic alternative to treat
GBMs since its approval in 2009. Bevacizumab, a recombinant
anti-VEGF antibody, notably increased progression-free sur-
vival and reduced tumor vascularization in GBMs [36]. None-
theless, bevacizumab does not seem to impact overall survival
in these patients either and further trials to evaluate this treat-
ment option are required [36].

Besides the aforementioned FDA-approved therapies, sev-
eral therapeutic strategies to treat GBM patients are currently
being investigated in clinical trials. Such strategies have nota-
bly been directed toward differentially expressed or hyperacti-
vated kinases identiﬁed in GBMs, such as EGFR [37].
Unfortunately, the effectiveness of small molecule inhibitors
of EGFR such as geﬁtinib and erlotinib has been proved to
be highly dependent on PI3K and PTEN status and yielded
modest results [16]. PI3K pathway inhibition is an attractive
axis in the development of targeted treatments in GBMs.
While preclinical studies using PI3K inhibitors have lead to
promising results [38], clinical trials evaluating enzastaurin, a
PKC/PI3K/AKT inhibitor, did not positively impact progres-
sion-free survival in GBM patients and were therefore halted
[39]. Inhibition of MET, a frequently overexpressed receptor
in GBMs, is also currently under evaluation in clinical trials
[40]. Unfortunately, a phase II trial using an anti-MET anti-
body, AMG102, demonstrated no signiﬁcant antitumor activ-
ity in patients with recurrent GBMs [41]. Overall,
these
therapeutic approaches have yielded at best marginally posi-
tive results and TMZ, the hallmark chemotherapeutic agent

routinely used to treat GBMs, remains the primary therapeutic
alternative.

Several hurdles need to be overcome to improve the current
standard of care offered to GBM patients. An inherent prob-
lem associated with GBM treatment remains the blood–brain
barrier, which restricts tumor site access for many therapeutic
agents [42]. Novel strategies to deliver therapeutic agents to the
tumor site are being explored including convection-enhanced
delivery, a positive-pressure infusion-based method that can
be used to administer chemotherapeutics directly into peritu-
moral brain [43]. Unfortunately, using small molecular weight
inhibitors directed against one molecular target has often lead
to activation of compensatory signaling pathways leading to
treatment failure [44]. Nevertheless, the drawbacks of single-
agent therapies provide crucial insight into the ongoing devel-
opment of combination treatments in GBMs. Simultaneous
targeting of key molecular nodes including EGFR, VEGFR,
PI3K, CDKs and the JAK/STAT signaling axis has generated
promising results in rodent models of GBMs [45–47]. A recent
study using a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor in human GBM
xenografts showed increased survival, when compared to
TMZ treatment alone [48]. In addition, clinical trials targeting
these molecular nodes are underway to identify sensitizing
agents to be used in combination treatments for TMZ-resistant
GBM patients [2]. Overall, further investigations are required
to address these challenges and improve outcomes for GBM
patients.

Temozolomide resistance in glioblastomas

TMZ, the chemotherapeutic agent given as part of the primary
standard of care to treat GBMs, is an alkylating agent that
adds a methyl (m) group to purine bases of DNA, producing
O6-guanine (G) (6%), N7-G (70%) and N3-adenine (A) (9%)
[49,50]. TMZ treatment leads to cell death primarily through
O6-G methylation [51]. This modiﬁcation leads to G pairing
with thymine (T) during DNA replication and promotes dou-
ble-stranded DNA crosslinking lesions that are difﬁcult to
repair by the DNA mismatch repair system, ultimately con-
tributing to cell death [52,53]. As a lipophilic molecule, TMZ
is administered orally and can penetrate the blood–brain bar-
rier with relative ease and has a high bioavailability (>99%)
[8,54,55]. TMZ toxicities are typical of an alkylating agent
and include hematological side effects such as lymphopenia,
thrombocytopenia and leucopenia [6].

Unfortunately, inherent and acquired TMZ resistance is a
common occurrence in GBM patients. Such resistance in glio-
mas is strongly correlated with the presence and activity status
of the DNA-repair enzyme O6- MGMT, an enzyme capable of
removing methyl groups from the O6 position of G residues
and counteracting the cytotoxic effects of TMZ [9,56]. MGMT
protein expression in GBM tumors can signiﬁcantly increase
their ability to resist TMZ treatment [57,58]. MGMT expres-
sion is reduced by hypermethylation of its promoter, resulting
in increased TMZ sensitivity [59]. MGMT hypermethylation is
notably detected in 45–70% of high grade gliomas [60].

Other factors, besides MGMT expression, can contribute to
TMZ resistance in GBMs. A functional DNA mismatch repair
system is required for TMZ sensitivity. This pathway recog-
nizes the O6-mG-T mispair and recruits proteins that excise
speciﬁcally the erroneous T thus
recycling the original

O6-mG. O6-mG is subsequently mispaired with another T
and the adduct is repaired creating a cycle that ultimately leads
to persistent DNA breaks, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
[61,62]. A deﬁcient DNA mismatch repair system can thus con-
tribute to TMZ resistance. Expression of mismatch repair pro-
tein MSH6 is down-regulated in GBM patients treated with
TMZ, which could play an inﬂuential role in acquired resis-
tance to the drug [63]. While TMZ cytotoxic effects are primar-
ily attributable to the O6-mG lesion, the N7-mG and N3-mA
modiﬁcations cannot be overlooked. Components of the base
excision repair pathway rapidly remove and repair the modi-
ﬁed bases and contribute to TMZ resistance. AP endonuclease
(APE-1), a key enzyme in this pathway, is linked to TMZ resis-
tance due to its up-regulated expression in human gliomas [64].
Interestingly,
inhibition of base excision repair pathway
sensitized cells to TMZ in ovarian cancer via increased cyto-
toxic effects of N3-mA and N7-mG [65].

Looking ahead, improving TMZ sensitivity in GBM pa-
tients is conceivable and might require undertaking multi-tar-
geted therapeutic approaches directed at the aforementioned
repair mechanisms or modifying the TMZ molecule itself.
Inhibition of the base excision repair pathway can sensitize
GBM cells to TMZ [66]. Pharmacological inhibition of APE-
1 with small molecule inhibitors in preclinical models potenti-
ated the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents [67]. Inhibition of
poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in
the DNA repair pathway, also improved TMZ sensitivity in
various models in vitro and in vivo [68]. Structurally, TMZ is
an imidazotetrazine that can deliver methyl groups to selected
DNA bases. Synthesis of imidazotetrazine analogues capable
of adding a chemical group unrecognizable by MGMT could
potentially circumvent the basic repair mechanisms underlying
TMZ resistance. A series of such analogues were recently
tested for their cytotoxic effect in TMZ-resistant GBM cells
and two lead molecules with anticancer properties irrespective
of MGMT and DNA mismatch repair pathway status were
identiﬁed [69]. Unfortunately, the lead compounds identiﬁed
in this study also demonstrated signiﬁcant plasma instability
in a mouse model thus raising doubts on their in vivo useful-
ness. While multi-targeted approaches to sensitize GBM cells
to TMZ and improvement of the drug itself are of interest, a
better characterization of the molecular footprint associated
with TMZ resistance is needed for such strategies to succeed.

Metabolomics as a tool for cancer research

Metabolomics and metabonomics, provide the quantitative
measurement of metabolic composition as well as metabolic
changes that occur in living systems as a result of a pathophys-
iological stimuli or genetic modiﬁcation. Metabolomics (in this
text used to represent both metabolomics and metabonomics
approaches) can provide a snapshot of the biochemical path-
ways modulated under different conditions [70]. It measures
the collection of all small molecule metabolites or chemicals
that can be found in a cell, organ or organism [71]. This met-
abolic proﬁle, the metabolome, can be leveraged for different
purposes. This section focuses on the usefulness of metabolo-
mics in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response
assessment with a special emphasis on GBMs.

Various metabolic changes are at work in cancer cells ini-
tially due to the functions of oncogenes and oncosuppressors

and are subsequently promoted by changing cellular environ-
ment [72,73]. The highly proliferative status of cancer cells
translates into elevated energy and biomaterial requirements
and leads to increased consumption of some metabolites such
as glucose and glutamine, altered energy generation and
changes in biomaterial generation routes [74,75]. Increased gly-
colytic capacity and elevated phospholipid levels have been re-
ported in several cancer models [76]. In contrast, metabolites
such as amino acids and nucleotides have different signatures,
depending on the cancer type assessed [77]. Metabolomics, as a
cancer diagnosis tool, can help in characterizing differentially
expressed metabolites between normal and cancer cells or be-
tween cancer subtypes or stages. Metabolomics analysis of tis-
sue ex vivo as well as in vivo can provide clear distinction
between tumor and healthy cells and can be used in diagnosis
of many tumor types. A study comparing the metabolome of
breast cancer samples and normal specimens identiﬁed the
malignant samples with considerable sensitivity and speciﬁcity
[78]. Using a similar approach, elevated levels of taurine, lac-
tate and choline were also detected in colorectal cancer tissue
specimens [79]. While unlocking the metabolome of a primary
tumor can yield interesting insights into the differentially reg-
ulated pathways underlying the malignancy, assessing circulat-
ing metabolites in cancer patients also holds tremendous
diagnostic potential albeit with still outstanding issues regard-
ing confounding factors. A metabolomics-based approach was
employed to characterize the proﬁle of circulating metabolites
in epithelial ovarian cancer patients and was able to discrimi-
nate between cancer patients and healthy premenopausal sub-
jects [80]. A recent study identiﬁed 22 differentially expressed
metabolites in the urine of epithelial ovarian cancer patients
versus healthy individuals [81]. The metabolic signatures of ur-
ine samples collected from esophageal cancer patients demon-
strated a distinctive footprint that allowed discrimination
between esophageal carcinoma and healthy controls as well
[82]. Similarly, several metabolomics-based approaches have
been undertaken in gliomas [83]. Choline, lactate and gluta-
mine were able to differentiate between GBM cell lines [84].
In primary tumors of pediatric origin, phosphocholine was
identiﬁed as a potential differentiator between medulloblasto-

mas, ependymomas and pilocytic astrocytomas [85]. More-
over, levels of lactate and lipid could assist in differentiating
low-grade from high-grade primary gliomas [86]. Similarly, an-
other research group demonstrated that gliomas of higher
grade exhibited signiﬁcantly elevated choline levels and in-
creased lipid synthesis [87]. In biopsies obtained from different
brain mass lesions, increased choline levels and decreased N-
acetyl-aspartic acid (NAA) levels were indicators of tumori-
genic samples [88]. Choline is an intermediate of phospholipid
metabolism and serves as an important building block for syn-
thesis of selected lipids required for cell membrane structure
and function [89]. As a result, elevated choline levels are
needed in conditions of increased cell-membrane turnover such
as in proliferating cells [90]. Lower myo-inositol levels were re-
ported in GBMs, when compared to low-grade astrocytomas
[91]. This ﬁnding is aligned with a previous report that de-
scribed myo-inositol as a molecule primarily located in astro-
cytes [92]. In addition, alanine and valine were capable of
assisting with the grading of oligodendrogliomas [93]. Interest-
ingly, this study demonstrated increased levels in high-grade
oligodendrogliomas of these two amino acids, which were
linked to anaerobic metabolism, along with a concurrent
reduction in molecules related to the Krebs pathway, such as
proline, glutamate, glutamine and NAA. It was hypothesized
that this metabolic shift toward fermentative metabolism was
indicative of tumor hypoxia in high-grade oligodendrogliomas.
Metabolites isolated from cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) of glioma
patients revealed a distinctive metabolic signature, when com-
pared with samples of healthy controls [94]. A summary of key
ﬁndings on differentially expressed metabolites in gliomas is
presented in Table 1.

Besides its diagnostic utility, metabolomics also holds tre-
mendous potential as a tool to monitor treatment response
in cancer patients. Several studies highlighting this application
have notably been conducted in breast cancer patients. Analy-
sis of the metabolic proﬁles of serum collected from metastatic
breast cancer patients assisted in identifying a subset of pa-
tients that were more likely to respond to combination therapy
[95]. Four metabolites including threonine, isoleucine, gluta-
mine and linolenic acid were also found to serve as good pre-

dictors of neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic response in breast
cancer patients [96]. The potential importance of choline-con-
taining compounds as a biomarker for therapeutic response in
cancer has also been proposed. Down-regulation of such com-
pounds was associated with a positive therapeutic response in
breast, prostate and brain cancer [97]. Studies using metabolo-
mics to monitor and predict therapeutic response in GBM pa-
tients are sparse, yet this application is of great interest.
Metabolic assessment of extracellular ﬂuid collected in GBM
patients that undergo conventional radiotherapy highlighted
the potential of detecting metabolic markers for the prediction
of early treatment response [98]. With the inherent challenges
that exist with the current therapies available to treat GBMs,
a noninvasive tool for early prediction of TMZ response would
hold great promise. Primary analysis of metabolic proﬁles by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in a TMZ-
resistant and a TMZ-sensitive GBM cell line shows clear dif-
ferences (Figure 1). NMR spectroscopy provides highly reli-
able measurements of metabolic proﬁles in any biological
system. Spectral data can be used directly for the analysis of
metabolic differences between cell lines using principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA). PCA evaluation of U373 and LN229 cells
treated with 250 lM TMZ or vehicle clearly depicted differ-
ences in metabolic proﬁles in two cell types as well as changes
in metabolic proﬁles following TMZ treatment (St-Coeur
et al., unpublished data). This indicates potential for utilizing
metabolomics for prediction of tumor response to TMZ.
Nonetheless, much remains to be done, such as comparing

the quantitative metabolic proﬁles of various TMZ-resistant
GBM cell lines with similar samples collected from TMZ-sen-
sitive cell models as well as analysis of metabolic response to
TMZ treatment in these distinct cell types. This process will
subsequently need to be validated in clinically relevant samples
such as primary GBM tumors or serum collected from GBM
patients, thus striving toward the identiﬁcation of metabolic
markers for TMZ treatment planning.

Outlook

GBMs are aggressive brain tumors for which therapeutic alter-
natives are limited. In addition, the chemotherapeutic agent
used as part of the current standard of care is linked to inher-
ent and acquired resistance, which often leads to treatment
failure. Looking ahead, rational design of modiﬁed alkylating
agents using TMZ as scaffold and combinatorial therapeutic
approaches are envisioned to improve the current prognosis
for GBM patients. It is expected that identiﬁcation of meta-
bolic markers via metabolomics-based tools, whether to dis-
criminate between speciﬁc tumor subtypes or to assist in
predicting treatment response, will be of great help in the man-
agement of GBMs.
