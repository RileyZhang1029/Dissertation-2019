ABSTRACT
Summary: Gene coexpression analysis was developed to explore
gene interconnection at
from a systems
perspective, and differential coexpression analysis (DCEA), which
examines the change in gene expression correlation between two
conditions, was accordingly designed as a complementary technique
to traditional differential expression analysis (DEA). Since there is a
shortage of DCEA tools, we implemented in an R package ‘DCGL’
ﬁve DCEA methods for identiﬁcation of differentially coexpressed
genes and differentially coexpressed links, including three currently
popular methods and two novel algorithms described in a companion
paper. DCGL can serve as an easy-to-use tool to facilitate differential
coexpression analyses.

1 INTRODUCTION
From the perspective of systems biology, gene coexpression
analysis is useful for investigating gene interconnection at the
expression level. Differential coexpression analysis (DCEA), which
examines the change in expression correlation of gene pairs
between two conditions, helps to explore the global transcriptional
mechanisms underlying phenotypic changes. Compared with
traditional differential expression analysis (DEA), the development
of DCEA tools is lagged. In this work, we developed an R package,
DCGL, implementing three previously proposed DCEA methods
and two new algorithms reported in a companion paper (Yu,H. et al.,
submitted for publication).

coexpression network (Choi et al., 2005). The weighted gene

coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) weights links with
correlation coefﬁcients and compares the sums of the correlation
coefﬁcients of a gene (Mason et al., 2009; van Nas et al., 2009).
In contrast, our two methods, differential coexpression proﬁle
(DCp) and differential coexpression enrichment (DCe), are designed
based on the exact coexpression changes of gene pairs, and thus
can differentiate signiﬁcant coexpression changes from relatively
trivial ones, and identify coexpression reversal between positive
and negative (Yu,H. et al., submitted for publication). All the
ﬁve methods are able to identify differentially coexpressed genes
(DCGs) from microarray datasets, and DCe is also able to pick out
differentially coexpressed gene pairs or links (DCLs).

2 DESIGN
A typical DCEA workﬂow involves three successive procedures:
link ﬁltration, DCG and DCL identiﬁcation.
gene ﬁltration,
Correspondingly, DCGL consists of
functions
(Fig. 1). For gene ﬁltration, one choice is based on the exp-
ression level (expressionBasedﬁlter) and the other based on its
variability (varianceBasedﬁlter). For link ﬁltration, we provide three
functions for cutting off coexpression values (systematicLinkﬁlter,
percentLinkﬁlter and qLinkﬁlter). A gene pair (link) is ﬁltered out

includes ﬁve
methods for identifying DCGs and DCLs, which mainly differ
in the measure of differential coexpression (dC) of a gene. After
the steps of gene ﬁltration and link ﬁltration, suppose gene i is
associated with ni links whose coexpression values are projected
to X ={xi1,xi2,...,xini

The dC measures of different methods are given in the following

3 IMPLEMENTATION
DCGL is released as an R package including two gene ﬁltering
functions, three link ﬁltering functions and ﬁve DCEA functions
(Fig. 1). These functions generally expect gene expression matrices
(with genes in rows and samples in columns) as a major input, and
the ultimate output are genes ranked by dC measure or P-value, from
which one can obtain a DCG list. DCe has an additional output of
classiﬁed DCLs. DCGL can be obtained from the supplementary
data to this manuscript, or at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
DCGL/index.html.

We tested the ﬁve DCEA methods using dataset GSE3068
obtained from GEO (Table 1). Note that this test was carried out with
the most time-efﬁcient option of link ﬁltration (setting thresholds on
coexpression value directly). For the memory analysis, we tested
DCp and DCe with the most memory-intensive ﬁltration option

Different subsets, with a reduced number of rows, were taken from GSE3068 by
favoring genes with top-ranked expression variability. The computing platform is a
Linux system with ﬁve nodes, each having a dual quad-core Intel Xeon 2.33 GHZ CPU
and a RAM of 16 GB. Execution time was averaged over ﬁve repetitive runs.

‘qLinkﬁlter’. We approached a memory limit of around 5.7 GB at
a gene total of 7000. So it is anticipated that, if qLinkﬁlter is evoked,
a gene expression matrix generally should undergo a gene ﬁltration
step beforehand so that the gene total is cut down to a few thousands
or less.

4 EXAMPLE
Three simulated datasets are included in the package for exploring
the functions. For example, ‘dataC’ gives expression values of 1000
genes in 20 samples divided equally into two groups corresponding
to two conditions. Since this dataset contains a moderate number
of genes, the gene ﬁltration step can be skipped. The link ﬁltration
procedure is wrapped as a sub-function in the DCEA functions, so
one can specify the link ﬁltration choice in the arguments of DCEA
functions.

If the DCEA function DCe is called, one can get a resulted variable
with four components. The gene names ranked by the dC measure
(P-value) make up the ﬁrst ‘$DCGs’ component, while DCLs of
different types are given in other three components.
