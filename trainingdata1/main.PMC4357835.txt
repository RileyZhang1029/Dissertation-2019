Abstract Preeclampsia, a complication of pregnancy characterized by hypertension and protein-
uria, has been found to reduce the subsequent risk for breast cancer in female offspring. As this pro-
tective effect could be due to exposure to preeclampsia-speciﬁc proteins during intrauterine life, the
proteomic proﬁles of umbilical cord blood plasma between preeclamptic and normotensive preg-
nancies were compared. Umbilical cord plasma samples, depleted of 14 abundant proteins, were
subjected to proteomic analysis using the quantitative method of nanoACQUITY ultra perfor-
mance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry with elevated energy mode of acquisitionE
(NanoUPLC-MSE). Sixty-nine differentially expressed proteins were identiﬁed, of which 15 and 6
proteins were only detected in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies,
respectively.

Additionally, expression of 8 proteins (gelsolin, complement C5, keratin type I cytoskeletal 10,
pigment epithelium-derived factor, complement factor B, complement component C7, hemoglobin
subunit gamma-2 and alpha-fetoprotein) were up-regulated in preeclampsia with a fold change of
P2.0 when compared to normotensive pregnancies. The identiﬁcation of alpha-fetoprotein in pre-
eclamptic umbilical cord blood plasma supported the validity of this screen as alpha-fetoprotein has
anti-estrogenic properties and has previously been linked to preeclampsia as well as a reduced breast
cancer risk. The ﬁndings of this pilot study may provide new insights into the mechanistic link
between preeclampsia and potentially reduced breast cancer susceptibility in adult life.

Introduction

that

Breast cancer is the most common cancer that affects women
in the United States. However, there are few effective interven-
tions to lower breast cancer risk. Epidemiological and experi-
mental studies suggest
the intrauterine environment
inﬂuences breast cancer risk in the offspring [1]. Among the
maternal, gestational and newborn characteristics, strong in-
verse associations with breast cancer risk have been found
for prenatal exposure to preeclampsia [1–3]. In a large popula-
tion-based study that examined prenatal factors and adult risk
of breast cancer in a cohort of Swedish women, women born
from a preeclamptic (PE) pregnancy had a 59% reduction in
breast cancer risk (relative risk 0.41, 95% conﬁdence interval
0.22–0.79) [2]. Additionally, a meta-analysis has shown that
among all women, PE-born offspring had a 52% lowered risk
of breast cancer (relative risk 0.48, 95% conﬁdence interval
0.30–0.78) [3]. This potential protective effect is as strong as
that associated with tamoxifen/raloxifene intervention [4] or
physical exercise [5].

Preeclampsia is a complication of 5–8% of all pregnancies
in the United States that brings signiﬁcant morbidity and mor-
tality for both mother and baby [6,7]. The hallmark character-
istics of preeclampsia are a new-onset of hypertension and
proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normo-
tensive (N) woman. Although the underlying causes of the syn-
drome remain obscure, abnormal placenta development has
been implicated [8]. There is also no compelling explanation
for the inverse association between preeclampsia and subse-
quent breast cancer risk in the offspring, but a possible inﬂu-
ence of the intrauterine environment has been implicated.
Although preeclampsia has been associated with higher levels
of umbilical cord alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) [9],
insulin-like
growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) [10], leptin [11], tri-
glycerides [12] and homocysteine [13], none of these efforts
have included a proteomic screen on PE umbilical cord plasma
to identify intrauterine biomarkers that might act synergetical-
ly or individually to be candidate cancer risk reduction mole-
cules, as has been reported for AFP, a glycoprotein with
anti-estrogenic properties [9,14].

As we hypothesize that the fetus of a PE pregnancy is ex-
posed to preeclampsia-speciﬁc proteins during gestation that
confer protection against breast cancer in the adult life, we
performed a pilot study to compare the protein proﬁle of
umbilical cord plasma from PE pregnancies with that from
N pregnancies by the quantitative proteomic method of nano-
ACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry with elevated energy mode of acquisitionE
(NanoUPLC-MSE) [15]. Absolute quantiﬁcation of proteins
by LCMSE is a unique technology implemented on Q-TOF
mass spectrometers, where accurate mass LCMS data were

collected in an alternating low energy (MS) and elevated en-
ergy (MSE) mode of acquisition [15]. Here we report the iden-
tiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of 69 proteins in PE and N
umbilical cord blood plasma, of which 15 and 6 proteins were
only detected in PE and N pregnancies, respectively. Addition-
ally, compared to N pregnancy, expression of 8 proteins was
up-regulated more than twofold and expression of 7 proteins
was down-regulated more than 1.5 fold in umbilical cord
blood plasma from PE pregnancy.

Results

Identiﬁcation of differentially expressed proteins between PE
and N umbilical cord plasma

Screening of umbilical cord blood plasma samples by Nano-
UPLC-MSE (as outlined in Figure 1) identiﬁed a total of 69
proteins (Table S1), of which 15 (Table 1) and 6 (Table 2) pro-
teins were exclusive to PE and N pregnancies, respectively
(Figure 2). An additional 48 proteins (Table S2) were detected
in umbilical cord blood plasma from both PE and N pregnan-
cies (Figure 2).

Identiﬁcation of proteins with up-regulated expression in PE
plasma

As daughters of PE births have a reduced risk for breast cancer
[2,3], we hypothesize that proteins exclusive to umbilical cord
plasma from PE pregnancies or up-regulated in PE plasma
may play a role in reducing breast cancer risk. Of the 15 pro-
teins that were exclusive to PE plasma (i.e., absent in N plas-
ma), hemoglobin subunit alpha (P69905) was present in the
largest quantity of approximately 190 fmol and with a mean
spectral count of 4.7 (Table 1). Additionally, serum amyloid

proteins that were detected in both groups and identiﬁed 13
proteins that were up-regulated in PE plasma with a fold
change P2.0 when compared to that of N pregnancies
(Table S1). An additional ﬁltering criterion using a Bayes fac-
tor value >1 was applied and further reduced the number of
proteins from 13 to 8 (Table 3). These proteins include comple-
ment C5 (C5; P01031), keratin type I cytoskeletal 10 or keratin
10 (P13645) and pigment epithelium-derived factor or serpin
peptidase inhibitor clade F member 1 (PEDF or SERPINF1;
P36955) that have a fold change >3 and a Bayes factor >5.
Of note, this proteomic screen also detected the previously
reported AFP (P02771) [9] (Table 3).

Identiﬁcation of proteins with down-regulated expression in PE
plasma

Conversely, proteins with expression that was only detected or
up-regulated in umbilical cord blood plasma from N pregnan-
cies (Table 2) when compared to PE pregnancies (Table 4) are
candidate proteins for increased breast cancer risk. These in-
clude proteins that were absent in PE plasma such as immuno-
globulin (Ig) kappa chain V-III region SIE (P01620), Ig heavy
chain V-III region SIE (P01766), prothrombin (P00734), apo-
lipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I; P02647), complement component
C6 (C6; P13671) and POTE ankyrin domain family member
E (Q6S8J3) (Table 2). Of the 48 proteins that were detected
in both PE and N plasma, expression of 13 proteins was
up-regulated in N plasma with a fold change P1.5 when com-
pared to PE plasma (Table S1). Applying an additional ﬁlter
criterion of identifying proteins with a Bayes factor >1

decreased the number of proteins to 7 (Table 4). These proteins
include alpha-1-antitrypsin or SERPINA1 (P01009) with the
highest fold change of 6.6, followed by complement factor H
(Factor H; P08603) with a fold change of approximately 5.9,
Ig kappa chain C region (P01834), Ig gamma-1 chain C region
(P01857), lumican (P51884), alpha-2 macroglobulin (P01023)
and alpha-2-HS glycoprotein (P02765) (Table 4).

Protein functions and pathways

Proteins with expression exclusive (Table 1) or up-regulated in
(Table 3) PE plasma (n = 23), and similarly proteins with
expression absent (Table 2) or down-regulated (Table 4) in
PE plasma (n = 13), were pooled and interrogated using the
DAVID interface for their functions, cellular components,
and participation in any pathways. Two proteins, both Ig
chain regions (P01620 and P01766), were not recognized by
DAVID. First, functional classiﬁcation of proteins with exclu-
sive or up-regulated expression, but not those with absent or
down-regulated expression, in PE plasma resulted in a cluster
consisting of 5 proteins, mainly components of the comple-
ment system, i.e., complement C1r subcomponent (C1r), C5,
C7, complement factor B (Factor B) and plasma protease C1
inhibitor or serpin peptidase inhibitor clade G member 1
(SERPING1). This observation was supported by KEGG

pathway analysis, although 2 proteins with absent or down-
regulated expression in PE plasma, namely C6 and Factor
H, also participate in the complement cascade (Figure S1). Sec-
ond, molecular function analysis identiﬁed a set of proteins
(n = 5) whose expression were exclusive to or up-regulated
in PE plasma, which display structural functions. These pro-
teins include collagen alpha-1(I) chain, ﬁbronectin, keratin
14, keratin 6A and keratin 10), which, except for ﬁbronectin,
played a role in ectoderm/epidermis development (Tables S3
and S4). Additionally, molecular functions that are unique to
proteins with exclusive or up-regulated expression in PE plas-
ma include serine-type endopeptidase activity (3 proteins: C1r,
plasma kallifrein B and Factor B) and oxygen transporter
activity (2 proteins: hemoglobin subunit alpha and hemoglobin
subunit gamma 2) (Table S3).

The set of proteins with exclusive or upregulated expression
share similar functions with those whose expression is either
absent or downregulated in PE plasma. These include enzyme
peptidase inhibitor activities such as endopeptidase inhibitor
and serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activities. However,
more proteins (n = 6) are found in the protein set with exclu-
sive or up-regulated expression in PE plasma (Table S3) than
in the set with absent or down-regulated expression in PE plas-
ma (n = 3) (Table S5). The protein sets also have members
that participate in immune inﬂammatory responses and

Figure 3 Validation of protein expression by Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to detect the presence of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), complement C5 (C5), pigment epithelium-derived
factor (PEDF), and complement factor H (factor H) in normotensive (N1, N2 and N3) and preeclamptic (PE1, PE2 and PE3) umbilical
cord blood samples. A. A Coomassie blue-stained SDS–PAGE gel showed equal loading of 10 lg protein per lane of all samples tested.
B. Western blot analysis for AFP showed a signiﬁcant association between the densitometric intensities of the bands with the
corresponding normalized protein quantity (R2 = 0.91, P = 0.003 signiﬁcant at **P < 0.01,
linear regression analysis) but a
nonsigniﬁcant (P = 0.6, t-test) up-regulation of AFP in PE when compared to N samples. C. Western blot analysis and quantiﬁcation
densitometric analysis showed that expression of PEDF was signiﬁcantly up-regulated in PE when compared to N samples (P = 0.006
signiﬁcant at **P < 0.01, t-test), whereas up-regulation for C5 expression and down-regulation for Factor H expression in PE plasma were
not signiﬁcant (P = 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, t-test). Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).

complement activation (Tables S4 and S6). Consistent with
the presence of these proteins in plasma, the majority of these
proteins were clustered to the extracellular region or extracel-
lular space in the cellular component analysis (Tables S7
and S8).

Validation of protein expression by Western blot analysis

To validate our ﬁndings, several proteins were selected for wes-
tern blot analysis (Figure 3). For representative proteins with
up-regulated expression in PE plasma, we chose 2 proteins
with high fold change and Bayes factor values, i.e., C5 and
PEDF. We also examined the expression of AFP, which has
been previously reported in PE plasma [9] and therefore would
serve as a positive control in our analysis. Factor H was se-
lected as the representative protein with up-regulated expres-
sion in N plasma. The loading of equal amounts (10 lg) of
total protein for each of the plasma samples analyzed was con-
ﬁrmed by Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel visuali-
zation (Figure 3A) before the transfer to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. First,
the quantiﬁcation
feature of the NanoUPLC-MSE method was validated as
the densitometric intensities for the bands of each sample

immuno-positive for the AFP antibody corresponded signiﬁ-
cantly with the normalized fmol quantities determined from
the bioinformatic analysis (Figure 3B; R2 = 0.91, P = 0.003,
linear regression analysis). Second, although there were sub-
stantial variations within each group, which is not uncommon
in human plasma samples, the mean densitometric intensities
of the bands for AFP and C5 were higher, but not signiﬁcantly
(P = 0.6 and 0.3, respectively, t-test), for PE samples when
compared to N samples (Figure 3B and C). However, the mean
band intensity for PEDF was signiﬁcantly (P = 0.006, t-test)
higher in PE than N samples (Figure 3C). Conversely, the
mean densitometric band intensity for Factor H was higher,
but not signiﬁcantly (P = 0.2, t-test), in N plasma when com-
pared to that of PE plasma (Figure 3C). These initial observa-
tions of protein expression are in accordance with the ﬁndings
of the proteomic screen although conﬁrmation of more protein
expression using more samples is needed.

environment might confer protection against the subsequent
development of breast cancer in female offspring [2,3,16], we

employed
of
NanoUPLC-MSE, a unique method to compare the relative
abundance of protein between samples based on their absolute
quantity from LC-MS data of tryptic peptides. In this method,
the average MS signal response for the three most intense tryp-
tic peptides per mole of protein has been found to be constant
within a coefﬁcient of variation of less than ±10% [15].
Hence, given an internal standard, the absolute quantity of
each protein could be determined in a complex mixture with-
out the cumbersome generation of a calibration-response curve
for speciﬁc polypeptides using numerous external reference
peptides or in the use of radiolabeled amino acids.

Notably, the screen detected the previously reported AFP
in the umbilical cord blood plasma of PE pregnancies [9]. In
epidemiological studies, elevated levels of AFP, a glycopro-
tein produced by the fetal liver and yolk sac with known
anti-estrogenic properties, have been independently associ-
ated with a reduced breast cancer risk [17] as well as indirectly
associated with a reduction in breast cancer based on its asso-
ciation with low birth weight [18], ethnicity [19], multiple
births [20] and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [9,21].
In addition to AFP, the set of proteins identiﬁed to be up-reg-
ulated in PE samples can also be linked to anti-cancer effects.
For example, PEDF or SERPINF1, a 50 kDa glycoprotein
that was ﬁrst discovered as a factor secreted by retinal pig-
ment epithelial cells with neuronal differentiation and neuro-
trophic capabilities [22], has been reported to have additional
roles in neuroprotection, anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumori-
genesis [23]. Indeed, both AFP [14] and PEDF [24] have been
explored for their roles as anti-cancer agents. To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst report of a signiﬁcant up-regulation of
PEDF in PE plasma.

Besides playing a role in the pathological events of pre-
eclampsia [25,26], the identiﬁcation of components of the
complement system from PE umbilical cord plasma also
points to a potential role of an anti-tumor immune response.
It is conceivable that complement activation might be able to
eliminate cancer cells and thus contribute to a lower cancer
risk. For example, SAP, a member of the pentraxin family
that is found exclusively in our PE plasma samples, may func-
tion to clear such defective cells via complement activation
[27]. Additionally, cancer cells may evade the immune surveil-
lance of complement-mediated lysis by expressing membrane-
bound and soluble complement inhibitors, including Factor
H [28]. This is consistent with our hypothesis that proteins
that are down-regulated in PE plasma, such as Factor H,
are potential molecules of increased cancer risk. Hence, can-
cer-speciﬁc modulation of an anti-tumor immune response by
the complement system either via the blockage of comple-
ment inhibitors or inhibition of complement activation itself
is promising [29,30].

The signiﬁcance of identifying a set of keratins with exclu-
sive or up-regulated expression in PE plasma is unclear. Kera-
tin (or cytokeratin) expression is used to mark the epithelial
cell lineages in mammary development [31] and for the evalu-
ation of breast cancer subtypes [32]. While keratin can be a
contaminant introduced by sample handling, expression of
keratin 10 has been reported to be up-regulated in lymph node
metastasis of liver [33]. Arguably, unlike secretory proteins
such as AFP, PEDF and components of the complement sys-
tem, the presence of cytoskeletal proteins in the plasma might

indicate that they are no longer associated with the cells, thus
conferring protection.

Many of the potential proteins of low- and high-risk breast
cancer from our screen display endopeptidase inhibitor activi-
ties. Although the role of such activities in cancer is not fully
understood, it has been proposed that endopeptidase activity
is important in invasion where the action of proteinases is re-
quired for tumor cells to penetrate the extracellular matrix and
the basement membrane [34]. Thus, it follows that the identiﬁ-
cation of many proteins with peptidase inhibitor activity from
PE plasma is consistent with the model of decreased cancer
risk. However, counter-intuitively, the identiﬁed serine-type
endopeptidase inhibitor alpha-1-antitrypsin/SERPINA1 has
been associated with the development potential and poor prog-
nosis of gastric cancer [35], colorectal cancer [36], lung cancer
[37] and insulinomas [38]. It has been suggested that alpha-1-
antitrypsin may function to modulate host-immunodefence
mechanisms in favor of tumor cells and promote blood circu-
lation within tumor tissues for tumor development [36,37].
Hence, the down-regulation of alpha-1-antitrypsin expression
in PE plasma is again consistent with a model of decreased
cancer risk by preeclampsia.

ghrelin,

(IGFBP-3),

high-density

Our screen identiﬁed 13 potential high-risk breast cancer
proteins whose expression is decreased in PE or up-regulated
in N pregnancies (Tables 2 and 4). Previously reported high-
risk proteins include insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, insulin-like growth factor binding
protein-3
lipoprotein
(HDL)-cholesterol and Apo A-1 [10–12]. Hence, other than
Apo A-I, which was also picked up by our screen, we report
here 12 potential novel proteins that are postulated to be asso-
ciated with a higher prenatal risk of breast cancer due to fetal
programming. As an example, the expression of lumican, an
abundant small leucine-rich proteoglycan in breast stroma,
was signiﬁcantly correlated with mammographic density, an
important risk factor for breast cancer [39]. Future research
is needed to determine the relevance of these proteins in rela-
tion to breast cancer risk and novel therapies can be designed
to silence such potential high-risk molecules.

Current cancer research has focused mainly on the analy-
sis of pathological samples from patients whereby proteins
identiﬁed would be limited to those produced after disease
formation. Consistent with a fetal-origin-of-disease hypothe-
sis, we look for prenatal factors in the intrauterine environ-
ment using umbilical cord blood plasma samples. Although
our ﬁndings support research for the analysis of the prenatal
environment using umbilical cord blood to identify factors
that mediate a protective effect toward disease outcomes,
such as that of cancer, it must be pointed out that not all bio-
markers associated with preeclampsia play a role in reducing
breast cancer risk and it is unclear how these molecules, if
they do play such a role, mediate their effects from the in ute-
ro environment into adult life. Speculatively, such molecules
could have brought about genetic and/or epigenetic changes
to the stem cells of the developing embryo and these ‘altered’
cells become more resistant or susceptible to disease onset in
later life [40].

In summary, this pilot study identiﬁed candidate proteins in
umbilical cord blood plasma that might play a role in the pre-
vention of breast cancer later in life. The validity of our screen
for prenatal factors is supported by the identiﬁcation of several

Low HP et al / Proteomics of Preeclamptic Umbilical Cord Plasma

341

PE proteins that have anti-estrogenic, anti-angiogenic and
anti-tumorigenic activities, properties that are consistent with
a lowered risk of a hormone-responsive cancer such as breast
cancer. However, given the small sample size, conclusions
are preliminary. Upon validation with a larger sample size
and testing in animal models, such preeclampsia-associated
proteins can serve as biomarkers for identifying individuals
with different susceptibilities to breast cancer, give us insight
into the potential prenatal mechanisms by which preeclampsia
mediates its protective effect against breast cancer in female
offspring, and lead to potential applications in cancer surveil-
lance and prevention.

Materials and methods

Experimental workﬂow

The experimental workﬂow is summarized in Figure 1. Brieﬂy,
subjects with PE and N pregnancies were recruited and, at the
time of birth, their umbilical cord blood was collected, processed
and the plasma stored at  80 °C prior to analysis. The plasma
was immuno-depleted of 14 most abundant proteins with the
Seppro IgY14 column and processed for analysis by the proteo-
mic technology of NanoUPLC-MSE. Selected differentially ex-
pressed proteins were validated by western blot analysis.

Subject recruitment

The study protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards of the University of Massachusetts Medical School
and Tufts Medical Center, and informed consent was obtained
from all participating subjects. Study subjects were recruited
among pregnant women who delivered at Tufts Medical Cen-
ter, Boston, MA. All subjects were 18 years or older with a sin-
gleton pregnancy, HIV- and hepatitis B-negative, and the fetus
was free of anomalies by ultrasound examination. Preeclamp-
sia and its severity were diagnosed using standard clinical cri-
teria [7]. Brieﬂy, preeclampsia was diagnosed by the presence
of a persistently elevated systolic blood pressure (BP)
P140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP P90 mmHg after 20 weeks
of gestation along with a 24-h urinary protein output of
P300 mg or P1+ proteinuria on dipstick.

Umbilical cord blood collection and processing

Infants were delivered according to standard obstetrical prac-
tices. Umbilical cord blood was collected from the umbilical
vein using a blood collection bag containing 35 ml of citrate–
phosphate–dextrose anticoagulant
(Fenwal, Lake Zurich,
IL). Samples were centrifuged at 20 °C for 30 min at 400g
within 24 h of collection. The top plasma layer was harvested
into 2-ml cryovials and stored at  80 °C prior to use. In this
pilot study, umbilical cord plasma samples were collected from
three PE pregnancies (PE1, PE2 and PE3) and equal number
of N controls (N1, N2 and N3) for proteomic analysis.

Plasma protein processing

Samples were depleted of abundant proteins using the Seppro
IgY14 Spin Column Kit (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. After depletion, the

samples were concentrated by ﬁltration on a 10-kDa cutoff
Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) until less than 200 ll of concentrated solution remained.
Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford meth-
od. The concentrated samples were prepared in 50 mM ammo-
nium bicarbnonate with 0.1% RapiGest. The proteins were
then reduced in 5 mM dithiothreitol at 60 °C for 30 min and
alkylated in 15 mM iodoacetamide by incubation in the dark
at room temperature for 30 min. A tryptic digestion was per-
formed at 30 °C overnight with 1.5 lg of trypsin (Promega,
Madison, WI). The RapiGest was acid cleaved by the addition
of triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5%
at 37 °C for 45 min. The particulates were centrifuged down
and the peptides in the supernatant were passed through a
0.22 lm Amicon Ultrafree-MC spin-ﬁlter (Millipore) before
analysis by NanoUPLC-MSE.

NanoUPLC-MSE analysis

Samples were individually analyzed by the non-data depen-
dent absolute protein quantiﬁcation method described by Sil-
va and colleagues [15]. Before each injection, the protein
concentration of the sample was adjusted to 500 ng/ll with
0.1% TFA. A tryptic digest of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH; 200 fmol/ll; Waters, Milford, MA) was added to
the digests as an internal standard for quantiﬁcation. Nano-
ﬂow separations of the tryptic peptides were performed on
a NanoUPLC system (Waters). The column temperature
was maintained at 35 °C. Partial
loop sample injections
(2 ll) were performed in a random order with three analyses
of each sample. The UPLC system was equilibrated with 5%
acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% formic acid (FA) (mobile phase A).
Separation of injected tryptic peptides was achieved by appli-
cation of a linear 60-min gradient from 3% to 90% ACN in
0.1% FA which was passed through both the trapping (Sym-
metryC18, 180 lm · 20 mm; Waters) and analytical columns.
A lock mass solution (200 fmol/ll of Glu-ﬁbrinopeptide; Sig-
ma) in 30% ACN/0.1% FA in water was delivered via the
auxiliary solvent pump at 300 nl/min into the reference
sprayer of the NanoLockSpray source. Alternating high
and low collision energy mass spectra of NanoUPLC eluates
were acquired using a Q-TOF Premier mass spectrometer
(Waters). Nanospray ionization was performed using un-
coated, pulled fused silica emitters (New Objective, Woburn,
MA) at a potential of 3.5 kV. The time-of-ﬂight (TOF) ana-
lyzer was operated in the V mode with a typical mass resolu-
tion of 10,000. Alternating low and high collision energy
scans were used to obtain low collision energy (4 eV) MS
spectra and programmed high collision energy (ramped from
15 to 40 eV) MSE mixed product ion spectra, both acquired at
0.6 s/scan. The instrument was calibrated using 13 fragment
ions from a high energy scan of the [M+2H]2+ ion from
Glu-ﬁbrinopeptide. To correct any shifts in masses that oc-
curred during analyses, a single-point lock mass correction
was performed at 30 s intervals using the [M+2H]2+ ion
from Glu-ﬁbrinopeptide (m/z 785.8426). The raw ﬁles ac-
quired were processed and searched against the database of
human proteins generated from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
protein sequence database downloaded on September 9,
2009 (www.expasy.org), using the ProteinLynx Global Server
(PLGS) IdentityE version 2.4 software (Waters).

Bioinformatic and data analysis

Scaffold

Scaffold (version 3.00.03, Proteome Software, Portland, OR)
was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identi-
ﬁcations. Peptide identiﬁcations were accepted if they could be
established at >95% probability as speciﬁed by the Peptide
Prophet algorithm [41]. Protein identiﬁcations were accepted
if they could be established at >99% probability as assigned
by the Protein Prophet algorithm [42] and contained at least
3 identiﬁed peptides. Proteins that contained similar peptides
and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis
alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.

Fold change determination

Relative abundance of each protein was assessed by ﬁrst con-
verting intensity values to fmol amounts by normalization to
200 fmol ADH internal control added in each run. As the aver-
age MS signal of the three most intense peptides from each
protein is proportional to the abundance of that protein [15],
the total amount in fmol of all the proteins identiﬁed for each
run was determined and the fmol amounts of each protein was
then normalized so that the sum of each run was the same for
all the runs. Mean values for all the runs of each sample and
the mean value for each of the two groups of samples were cal-
culated. Fold changes were determined by comparing the
means of the two groups. A value >2.0 or >1.5 (based on
the upper bound of the 95% conﬁdence interval) was used as
our signiﬁcance threshold for proteins whose expression was
up-regulated in PE and N pregnancies, respectively.

Spectral counting

Since spectral counts correlate with protein abundance [43],
relative abundance of each protein was also assessed by nor-
malization of spectral counts based on the total spectral counts
of each run, as reported previously [44]. Normalized spectral
counts were subjected to QSPEC analysis [45] to obtain Bayes
factor and false discovery rate (FDR) values as additional ﬁl-
tering criteria.

Ontology and pathway analysis

Gene ontology analysis [46] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis [47] were performed
using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Inte-
grated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Database (http://
david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) interface [48] for the proteins that
were unique or signiﬁcantly up-regulated in the two groups.
For gene ontology analysis, only molecular functions, biolog-
ical processes and cellular components with P < 0.05 (as spec-
iﬁed by DAVID) were considered.

Western blot analysis

Plasma samples (10 lg total protein/well) were separated by so-
dium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–
PAGE). A non-reducing SDS–PAGE was run for C5 detection
[49]. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and
blocked with 5% skim milk powder (for C5, Factor H and
PEDF) or 5% bovine serum albumin (for AFP) in tris-buffered
saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 2 h at room

temperature. After washing with TBS-T, the appropriate blot
was incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following anti-
bodies: anti-human Factor H (goat, 1:2000; AF4779, R&D Sys-
tems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-human AFP antibodies (chicken,
1:2000; AF1369, R&D Systems), mouse anti-human C5 (mouse,
1:500; sc-70476, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or
anti-human PEDF (mouse, 1:500; sc-53921, Santa Cruz Bio-
technology). After washing at room temperature, the blots were
incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1:5000 to 1:10,000 of
an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. The protein of interest was detected using the ECL
Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare Bio-Sci-
ences/Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in a LAS-4000
Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujiﬁlm Life Sciences, Valhalla,
NY). Densitometry was performed using the image analysis
software Multi Gauge V3.0 (Fujiﬁlm Life Sciences). Statistical
signiﬁcance was determined by t-test and linear regression anal-
yses at a two-sided P < 0.05.
