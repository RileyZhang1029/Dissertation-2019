ABSTRACT
Motivation: A new technique, mammalian green ﬂuorescence
protein (GFP) reconstitution across synaptic partners (mGRASP),
enables mapping mammalian synaptic connectivity with light
microscopy. To characterize the locations and distribution of
synapses in complex neuronal networks visualized by mGRASP, it is
essential to detect mGRASP ﬂuorescence signals with high accuracy.
Results: We developed a fully automatic method for detecting
mGRASP-labeled synapse puncta. By modeling each punctum as a
Gaussian distribution, our method enables accurate detection even
when puncta of varying size and shape partially overlap. The method
consists of three stages: blob detection by global thresholding; blob
separation by watershed; and punctum modeling by a variational
Bayesian Gaussian mixture models. Extensive testing shows that
the three-stage method improved detection accuracy markedly, and
especially reduces under-segmentation. The method provides a
goodness-of-ﬁt score for each detected punctum, allowing efﬁcient
error detection. We applied this advantage to also develop an efﬁcient
interactive method for correcting errors.

1 INTRODUCTION
An important challenge in neuroscience is to map the synaptic
connectivity of neuronal networks in mammalian brains. Among
advanced technologies for mapping connectivity, the ﬂuorescence-
based mGRASP (Kim et al., 2012) stands as a markedly powerful
tool for comprehensive studies of synaptic circuits in mammalian
brains. The mGRASP technique is based on ﬂuorescence that is
reconstituted when two non-ﬂuorescent split GFP fragments targeted
to the synaptic membranes in two separate neuronal populations
are closely opposed across the synaptic cleft; thus, ﬂuorescence
uniquely indicates a synapse. Computational methods including
image stitch, neuron reconstruction and synapse detection have been
applied successfully to investigate the locations and distributions
of synapses in dendritic compartments and in neurons labeled with
mGRASP. In our previous study, computational analysis for synapse
detection achieved 93% accuracy. Here we introduce optimizations
to improve synapse detection and other tasks.

Detecting mGRASP-labeled synapses is complicated by the low
signal-to-noise ratios of the original images, the variety of the
sizes and shapes of ﬂuorescent puncta, and signal overlap from
neighboring puncta (Fig. 1). To overcome these difﬁculties, we
previously applied a method based on Gaussian template matching
followed by blob merging (Kim et al., 2012). But,

splitting procedure, this method frequently suffered from under-
segmentation, which is the error of counting multiple puncta as one.
Although no other method had been developed speciﬁcally
the problem is
for punctum detection in mGRASP images,
closely related to ﬂuorescent particle detection (e.g. GFP-labeled
peroxisomes and GLUT4), for which several methods have been
published (Bonneau et al., 2005; Mashanov and Molloy, 2007;
Sage et al., 2005; Smal et al., 2010). However, most of these
methods are not suitable for mGRASP-labeled punctum detection
because they cannot accommodate particles featuring a wide range
of sizes, irregular shapes and degrees of overlap or they are not
readily extended into three dimensions. For example, (Smal et al.,
2010) evaluated several 2D particle detection methods and found
that multiscale variance-stabilizing transform (MSVST) (Zhang
et al., 2007) and h-dome transform (Smal et al., 2008) based
methods offered the best performance among unsupervised methods.
However, both these methods assume that the particles are well
separated. MSVST takes any connected foreground feature as a
particle without providing any splitting correction, and h-dome
based method treats foreground clusters as noise. Neither method

provides a solution to the problem of puncta overlap. The review
also introduced two supervised methods, one of which was originally
reported in (Jiang et al., 2007). But it is not straightforward to
generalize the 2D edge features used in the methods to 3D. In
particular, we found it impractical to design a set of template features
for our data and to build a sufﬁciently large training set, both of
which are necessary for any supervised method.

A more promising category of method includes those using
mixture models, which estimate the shapes, sizes and locations of
particles from a blob in one framework. For example, (Thomann
et al., 2002) and (Jaqaman et al., 2008) used the mixture of point
spread functions to ﬁt clustered particles. (Zhao and Murphy, 2007)
employed a Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to detect protein
particles in 2D images. Later this method was extended to 3D
by (Peng and Murphy, 2011). However, these methods have a
major disadvantage. Since the number of particles is unknown, it
is necessary to ﬁt every possible mixture model to the data and then
determine the best ﬁt with minimal model complexity. Since this
ﬁtting problem is highly non-linear, ﬁnding good initial parameters
is crucial to the ﬁnal result. However, for synapse puncta these
parameters can be hard to choose because their size is uncertain.
Also, these methods lack post-processing for the mixture model, a
step necessary for puncta detection since puncta can have irregular
shapes and GMMs are sensitive to outlier data.

Other related methods are those used for DAPI-labeled nuclei
segmentation, in which a splitting procedure is often necessary
(Lin et al., 2003). One of the most impressive nuclei segmentation
methods was developed by (Al-Kofahi et al., 2010), who used
watershed techniques to separate clustered nuclei and then applied
graph cuts to reﬁne the results.

Here we introduce a new method based on a splitting strategy
using a marker-controlled watershed approach and a variational
Bayesian Gaussian mixture models (VBGMMs) to accurately detect
mGRASP-labeled synapses of variable sizes and shapes. Watershed
is used for separating connected blobs by distinguishing their
centers, and VBGMMs are then used for learning mixture models
directly from the image data rather than requiring many initial
parameters and an estimate of component number. Following
VBGMMs, we implement an effective mean-shift and merge post-
processing to further reﬁne the mixture models. We compare our
method to others, including the method in (Al-Kofahi et al., 2010),
by testing them on a large set of mGRASP data. The results show
that our method outperforms other tested methods and markedly
improves detection accuracy compared with our previous method.

2 APPROACH
Our main challenge was to correctly separate clustered puncta of
mGRASP-labeled synapses of variable sizes and shapes. The two
main features of puncta used by our detection algorithm are a clear
bright center and a convex shape; these features are also important
for a human inspecting these images. Our detection algorithm
follows a three stage process. The ﬁrst stage is to use thresholding
to separate the image’s foreground voxels from background voxels.
Foreground voxels form many clusters. In the second stage, centers
of these clusters are marked and then a marker-controlled watershed
is utilized to separate them. In the third stage, to detect the correct
number and locations of puncta automatically, we use a variational
bayesian mixture of gaussians followed by mean-shift to reﬁne

algorithm

detection. For numeric stability, we set a global size threshold
Nthreshold. In any stage, if the voxel number of a separated part
is smaller than Nthreshold, this part is treated as a punctum and will
not be separated further. Nthreshold is set to 20 in the example shown
here. Figure 2 shows a ﬂowchart illustrating the main steps of our
method.

3 METHODS
3.1 Automatic image binarization
The ﬁrst step is to identify foreground voxels that correspond to ﬂuorescence
signals of mGRASP-labeled synapses. We employed a global thresholding
method that has been successfully used to extract neurons from light
microscope images (Xie et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011). In brief, the method
takes advantage of the fact that most local maximal regions in a microscope
image are background noise. We found that a good threshold turned out
to be the transition point of the normalized histogram of local maxima. As
shown in Figure 3, from the histogram h where h(i) is the number of local
maximum voxels that have the intensity i, we ﬁrst obtain imax = argmaxi h(i),
the intensity value that has the highest frequency, and imin= argmini h(i),
the intensity with the lowest frequency minh(i). We then normalize the
histogram as

hr(i)=(h(i)−minh(i))(imin−imax)/(maxh(i)−minh(i)).

(1)
It can be shown that T = argmini(i−imax+hr(i)) is the transition point (Xie
et al., 2011), which is also taken as the global threshold to separate the
foreground and background of the image.

contains all the duplicates of the voxels. For each observation xjm we
determine a corresponding latent variable zm comprising a 1-of-K binary
vector with elements zmk for k=1,...,K, where K is the number of Gaussian
components. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is often used
to estimate model parameters of GMM by maximizing likelihood. The
number of Gaussian components, however, has to be given as a known
parameter when using an EM procedure. As K is unknown in our case,
instead, we would need to analyze the dataset for all possible K values
and then use Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) to compensate for the over-ﬁtting of complex models. This
is computationally inefﬁcient. We found an alternative, better, way is to use
a fully Bayesian approach based on variational inference that can optimize
the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of ﬁt at the same time
(Attias, 2000; Bishop, 2006). We adopted this method by adding data weights
{in|n=1,...,N} to make it better suited for our problem. Given the mixing
coefﬁcient π for each Gaussian component, the conditional distribution of

[minh(i), maxh(i)] to range [0, argmini h(i)−argmaxi h(i)]. The threshold
is argmini(hr(i)+i−argmaxi h(i))

3.2 Marker-controlled watershed segmentation
Binarization of an image results in many isolated blobs of connected
foreground voxels. There can be one or more puncta in each blob, and the
goal of this stage is to identify individual puncta blob by blob. This task
is similar to separating touching objects, which is a classical application
of the watershed algorithm. In practice, however, the original watershed
method tends to generate uncorrectable over-segmentation in a noisy image.
One common solution to this problem is to use a marker-controlled version
of watershed, which sets a size threshold for adding a ‘catchment basin’
(Vincent, 1993; Yang et al., 2006). Similar to any other watershed method,
the marker-controlled watershed starts checking voxels progressively from
the highest or lowest gray level, depending upon whether region borders
are darker or brighter than region centers. In our case the process starts
from the highest gray level because puncta usually have bright centers. At
each gray level, a blob is dissected into connected components of voxels
with intensities higher than the gray level. When a component contains only
one previously deﬁned marker, all voxels will be assigned to that marker;
when a component contains more than one marker, any unmarked voxel is
assigned to its closest marker. A new marker is added when a component
contains no pre-deﬁned marker and the size of a component exceeds the
threshold Tm. High Tm value can suppress local maxima caused by noise,
thus preventing over-segmentation. For our data, we choose Tm=6. After the
watershed process, every voxel of a blob is assigned to one of the markers.
Figure 4C shows the result of watershed separating for the example image.
It misses one punctum in Part 3 because its signal is weak and the center of
the punctum is unclear.

3.3 Mean-shift regulated VBGMMs
Since a punctum is assumed to have a bright center and a convex shape,
it can be modeled as a 3D Gaussian distribution. As a result, any blob
that has one or more puncta can be modeled as mixture of Gaussians. The
data for ﬁtting GMMs at this stage are taken from the previous watershed

segmentation. We denote the observed dataset by X={x1,...,xN}, where
for n=1,...,N are the coordinates of the n-th voxel of
the component. The intensity I={i1,...,iN} where in is the intensity of xn
total of M=(cid:4)
serves as weight value for ﬁtting; that is, we can assume that there are a

Although VBGMMs nicely solve the model selection problem, it requires
specifying a proper initial value K0, which should be the upper bound of
the actual number of puncta. For a non-saturated watershed component,
we set K0 as the number of local maximal regions. When the intensity of
the component is highly saturated, we use a 2D Euclidean distance map to
estimate K0 instead. To build the distance map, we ﬁrst binarize the maximum

intensity projection (on the x–y plane) of the target component by setting all
saturated voxels to 1 and other voxels to 0. The distance map is built upon
the foreground of the binary image. We set K as the number of local maxima
in the distance map plus the number of non-saturated local maxima in the
component. Since bayesian clustering using mixture of Gaussian components
is sensitive to outliers and noise (Svensén and Bishop, 2005), both of which
can lead to over-estimating the number of components, it is necessary to
provide a merging procedure to check whether some components actually
belong to the same punctum and, if they do, to merge them. In this procedure,
the center mk of the k-th Gaussian component is readjusted by the mean-shift
algorithm, an efﬁcient procedure for locating the nearest stationary point of
the underlying density function. By using mean-shift, we can move Gaussian
components disturbed by outliers and noise to the desired locations. We can
then merge the adjusted components according to their degree of overlap.
The mean-shift radius Rk is deﬁned as the semi-minor axis length of the x–y
projection of the Gaussian component within its 90% conﬁdence interval. It
can be calculated as follows
Rk =

(17)

,

D

where μ1/2(λi) is the median eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the
corresponding Gaussian component and pconf =0.9 deﬁnes the conﬁdence
region for its projection. Figure 4E and Figure 5 shows the process of
VBGMM ﬁtting, mean-shift and merging. The initial K in Figure 5 is 12,
which gives 12 Gaussians in a GMM (Figure 5B), and after the EM steps,
only three components remain. The second column of Figure 4E shows the
noise sensitivity of GMMs. Since some Gaussian components are ﬁt only to a
small number of data points and the number of components is overestimated,
they are then fed into the merging procedure. Figure 5D and the third column
of Figure 4E show the result of the mean-shift process, where all components
were moved to the center of puncta. After that, we merge any pair of Gaussian
components if either of their x–y projections have 80% overlap with the other.
Figure 5E and last column of Figure 4E show the ﬁnal results of merging.

3.4 Proof-Editing
Although automated detection can provide reasonably accurate
results, proof-editing is needed for correcting detection errors in
order to avoid drawing misleading conclusions, as can occur in some
other bioimage analysis tasks (Peng et al., 2011). Nevertheless, it
is very time consuming to scan the whole image visually to search
for detection errors because large images may contain thousands
of puncta. Therefore, it would be very helpful for an algorithm to
provide a detection score for each punctum to estimate the likelihood
a given detection is wrong. With such a score, we can signiﬁcantly
improve the efﬁciency of proof-editing by presenting puncta in the
order of their scores or with visual hints of the scores. Another
advantage of our method is that it allows calculating the ﬁtting score,
e.g. the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient, between the signal of a
punctum and its Gaussian model. The lower this conﬁdence score,
the more likely the detection is in error. Low scores can be spotted

input the actual puncta number which is 3 and run the EM GMM split, the
result becomes correct as shown in the small cropped image

easily with a colormap as shown in Figure 6B. The punctum with
the lowest score in the image is marked by an arrow, and it is indeed
an under-segmentation error (Figure 6B).

The score and colormap can guide users to ﬁnd the most
problematic regions quickly. After errors are located, they can be
corrected using computer-assisted manual editing. Two types of
errors can occur. The ﬁrst is over-segmentation that can be corrected
by merging neighboring puncta with one mouse click. The second
type is under-segmentation that can be corrected with a splitting
procedure carried out by computer after the user speciﬁes that blob
to split and how many puncta should result. Here we use GMMs
again to split any under-segmented blob. An example of correcting
under-segmentation is shown in Figure 6B.

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The mGRASP-labeled synapse data used for testing our method
were acquired under a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope as described
in our previous study (Kim et al., 2012). In all, 33 randomly selected
regions, which correspond to three neurons, were annotated semi-
automatically to build a ground truth set. These regions contain
more than 1000 puncta of various sizes and shapes. Some regions
contain highly clustered puncta, while others contain relatively
few or no puncta. Automatically detected mGRASP puncta (Kim
et al., 2012) in these regions were manually inspected in the 3D
visualization program vaa3d (Peng et al., 2010). True positives

(TP), false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were counted.
FP include over-segmentation errors (i.e. excessive splitting). FN
include under-segmentation errors (i.e. failed splitting) and missed
puncta. We compared our method with two other blob detection
methods used in (Al-Kofahi et al., 2010) and (Kim et al., 2012).
The method in (Al-Kofahi et al., 2010) starts with an automatic
binarization by Graph Cuts; we therefore refer to this method here
as ‘Graph Cuts’. The parameters of ‘Graph Cut’ are chosen based
the characteristics of our data. Minimum and Maximum scale of
LoG are set to 1 and 3 because our puncta range in radius from 1 to
6. The method in (Kim et al., 2012) uses template matching to ﬁnd
the best Gaussian ﬁt for covering the initial position; we therefore
refer to this method as ‘Template Matching’. To illustrate beneﬁts
of our three stage processing algorithm, we also created two more
methods by omitting the marker-controlled watershed stage or mean-
shift modiﬁed VBGMM stage. We refer to these two methods as
‘VBGMM’ and ‘Watershed’ respectively. Pmtk3 (http://code.google
.com/p/pmtk3/) was used for our VBGMM implementation. Results
from all methods were inspected manually and ambiguous puncta,
which cannot even be identiﬁed by biologists, were not counted in
FP and FN.

Table 1 summarizes the average performance measurements of
all methods. Overall, our fully automated algorithm achieved an
accuracy above 97%. The average F-measure (2 × precision ×
recall)/(precision + recall) for these data is 98.5%. Over-and under-
segmentation errors can be described in terms of precision and recall.
Our method has the highest recall value, which indicates that it
performs better than other methods for separating clustered puncta.
The precision is slightly lower than ‘Watershed’ because our marker
selection procedure is designed to prevent over-segmentation. Figure
7 shows the detection results of each method for two example
regions. Incorrect detections are marked by red arrows. We can
see that when dealing with a cluster composed of puncta with
various sizes, other methods tend to under-segment. The multiscale
LoG used in the ‘Graph Cuts’ method favors larger puncta, even
after we disabled the segmentation reﬁnement step of ‘Graph Cuts’
to avoid even greater under-segmentation (this step requires clear
edges between objects to be separated, but punctum clusters in
our data usually do not have this property). In the ‘Template
Matching’ method, under-segmentation can be produced by its
masking procedure, which may occlude small neighboring puncta.
The results in Figure 7E and F show that we need both watershed and
VBGMM stages to better utilize the characteristic features of puncta.
In the watershed stage, puncta with clear centers are identiﬁed. Then
the mean-shift modiﬁed VBGMM stage use shape information to
separate weak puncta from a cluster. The post merge mechanism we
designed for VBGMMs works better for a small number of puncta.
As the number of puncta grows, Gaussian components become
more complicated, and two or more distant Gaussian components
could be merged just because they overlap with an ill conditioned
Gaussian. The combination of ‘Watershed’ and ‘VBGMM’ in our
method can overcome this problem and avoid missing weak puncta
in ‘Watershed’ at the same time.

During our experiments, we found that a few watershed-separated
components only have signals on single slices. For these data, a two-
dimensional version VBGMMs might give better results. Indeed,
testing 2D VBGMMs on these data showed a modest improvement
of the results (30% of the cases were improved). Nevertheless, more
test cases are required to make a strong conclusion.

5 CONCLUSION
We developed a fully automated puncta-like object detection
algorithm based on distinctive morphological features of puncta,
i.e. a punctum has a convex shape and its center is brighter than
surrounding voxels. Marker-controlled watershed is used to detect
puncta with clear centers and mean-shift modiﬁed VBGMMs is used
to separate puncta by exploiting their convex shapes. Simple GMMs
often emphasize the distribution of data. The mean-shift and merge
procedure in post-processing can make sure that ﬁtted Gaussians
not only have appropriate shapes but also have stable centers. Our
method achieved very high accuracy from the detection of puncta
in real images.

Parameters needed for our algorithm are intuitive and easy to
choose. Only Tm used for watershed marker selection needs to
change for different application or data. It represents the expected
center voxel number which is proportional to average puncta size.
However, post-processing of the detected result is necessary since
our method may pick up some image noise. This procedure is
relatively easy because we can compute many kinds of features
for each detected punctum. In our experience, maximum intensity
and radius are good choices for ﬁlter conditions. We process our
detection result by removing punctum with radii smaller than 1 and
maximum intensity less than T +σ . T is global image threshold
we calculated in the binarization stage. sigma is an empirical choice
based on the visibility of corresponding puncta. Typically it is chosen
from 10 to 20 for an 8-bit image.

Although only rarely, we found some cases in which our algorithm
did not work as expected. Based on our analysis of testing data,
we found under-segmentation usually occurs when several small
elongated puncta are clustered together, like the position marked in
Figure 7B. Since such a feature is elongated and consists of few
voxels, it tends to be ﬁtted by a Gaussian with an axis larger than
its actual radius. Then mean-shift uses this overestimated radius
value to adjust the Gaussian position, which can end up in the
middle of several small puncta. Over-segmentation occurs when
large saturated puncta have unusual shapes. Our method might
separate it into several convex shapes. In such cases, the actual
number of puncta can be hard to determine, even by an expert
biologist. Fortunately, these saturated big puncta are easy to spot and
can be treated differently. Our method for calculating the conﬁdence
scores of puncta can readily help us locate these problematic regions.
