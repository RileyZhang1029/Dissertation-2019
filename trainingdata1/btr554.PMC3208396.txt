ABSTRACT
Summary: Analysing large amounts of data generated by next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is difﬁcult for researchers
or clinicians without computational skills. They are often compelled
to delegate this task to computer biologists working with command
line utilities. The availability of easy-to-use tools will become essential
with the generalization of NGS in research and diagnosis. It will
enable investigators to handle much more of the analysis. Here,
we describe Knime4Bio, a set of custom nodes for the KNIME (The
Konstanz Information Miner) interactive graphical workbench, for the
interpretation of large biological datasets. We demonstrate that this
tool can be utilized to quickly retrieve previously published scientiﬁc
ﬁndings.

the scientists themselves for building complex analyses. They allow
data reproducibility and workﬂows sharing.

Galaxy (Blankenberg et al., 2011), Cyrille2 (Fiers et al., 2008) and
Mobyle (Nron et al., 2009) are three web-based workﬂow engines
that users have to install locally if computational needs on datasets
are very large, or if absolute security is required. Alternatively,
softwares such as the KNIME (Berthold et al., 2007) workbench
or Taverna (Hull et al., 2006) run on the users’ desktop and can
interact with local resources. Taverna focuses on web services and
may require a large number of nodes even for a simple task. In
contrast, KNIME provides the ability to modify the nodes without
having to re-run the whole analysis. We have chosen this latest tool
to develop Knime4Bio, a set of new nodes mostly dedicated to the
ﬁltering and manipulation of VCF ﬁles. Although many standard
nodes provided by KNIME can be used to perform such analysis,
our nodes add new functionalities, some of which are described
below.

1 INTRODUCTION
Next-generation
led
to an explosion of the amount of data to be analysed. As
an example, a VCF (Danecek et al., 2011) ﬁle (Variant
Call Format—a standard speciﬁcation for
storing genomic
variations in a text ﬁle) produced by the 1000 Genomes Project
contains about 25 million Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV),
[http://tinyurl.com/ALL2of4intersection

2011)], making it difﬁcult to extract relevant information using
spreadsheet programs. While computer biologists are used to
invoke common command line tools—such as Perl and R—when
analysing those data through Unix pipelines, scientiﬁc investigators
generally lack the technical skills necessary to handle these tools
and need to delegate data manipulation to a third party.

Scientiﬁc workﬂow and data integration platforms aim to make
those tasks more accessible to those research scientists. These tools
are modular environments enabling an easy visual assembly and an
interactive execution of an analysis pipeline (typically a directed
graph) where a node deﬁnes a task to be executed on input data
and an edge between two nodes represents a data ﬂow. These
applications provide an intuitive framework that can be used by

KNIME but focusing on FASTQ data ﬁles was published by Jagla et al (Jagla
et al., 2011).

2 IMPLEMENTATION
The java API for KNIME was used to write the new nodes,
which were deployed and documented using some dedicated XML
descriptors. A typical workﬂow for analysing exome sequencing data
starts by loading VCF ﬁles into the working environment. The data
contained in the INFO or the SAMPLE columns are extracted and
the next task consists in annotating SNVs and/or indels. One node
predicts the consequence of variations at the transcript/protein level.
For each variant, genomic sequences of overlapping transcripts
are retrieved from the UCSC knownGene database (Hsu et al.,
2006) to identify variants leading to premature stop codons, non-
synonymous variants and variants likely to affect splicing. Some
nodes have been designed to ﬁnd the intersection between the
variants in the VCF ﬁle and a various source of annotated genomic
regions, which can be: a local BED ﬁle, a remote URL, a mysql
table, a ﬁle indexed with tabix (Li, 2011), a BigBed or a BigWig
ﬁle (Kent et al., 2010). Other nodes are able to incorporate data from
other databases: dbSNFRP (Liu et al., 2011), dbSNP, Entrez Gene,
PubMed, the EMBL STRING database, Uniprot, Reactome and
GeneOntology (von Mering et al., 2007), MediaWiki, or to export
the data to SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2001), Polyphen2 (Adzhubei
et al., 2010), BED or MediaWiki formats. After being annotated,
some SNVs (e.g. intronic) can be excluded from the dataset and the
remaining data are rearranged by grouping the variants per sample
or per gene as a pivot table. Some visualization tools have also
been implemented: the Picard API (Li et al., 2009) or the IGV

browser (Robinson et al., 2011) can be used visualize the short reads
overlapping a variation.

As a proof of concept, we tested our nodes to analyse the exomes
of six patients from a previously published study (Isidor et al., 2011)
related to the Hajdu Cheney syndrome (Fig. 1). For this purpose,
short reads were mapped to the human genome reference sequence
using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2010) and variants were called using
SAMtools mpileup (Li et al., 2009). Homozygous variants, known
SNPs (from dbSNP) and poor-quality variants were discarded,
and only non-synonymous and variants introducing premature stop
codons were considered. On a RedHat server (64 bits, 4 processors,
2 GB of RAM), our KNIME pipeline generated a list of six genes in
45 min: CELSR1, COL4A2, MAGEF1, MYO15A, ZNF341 and more
importantly NOTCH2, the expected candidate gene.1

3 DISCUSSION
In practical terms, a computer biologist was close to our users to help
them with the construction of a workﬂow. After this short tutorial,
they were able to quickly play with the interface, add some nodes
and modify the parameters without any further assistance, but the
suggestion or the conﬁguration of some speciﬁc nodes (for example,
those who require a snippet of java code). At the time of writing,
Knime4Bio contains 55 new nodes. We believe Knime4Bio is an
efﬁcient interactive tool for NGS analysis.
