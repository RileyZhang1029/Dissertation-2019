Abstract The aim of this study was to optimize electrofusion conditions for generating porcine tet-
raploid (4n) embryos and produce tetraploid/diploid (4n/2n) chimeric embryos. Different electric
ﬁeld intensities were tested and 2 direct current (DC) pulses of 0.9 kV/cm for 30 ls was selected
as the optimum condition for electrofusion of 2-cell embryos to produce 4n embryos. The fusion
rate of 2-cell embryos and the development rate to blastocyst of presumably 4n embryos, reached
85.4% and 28.5%, respectively. 68.18% of the fused embryos were found to be 4n as demonstrated
by ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Although the number of blastomeres in 4n blastocysts
was signiﬁcantly lower than in 2n blastocysts (P < 0.05), there was no signiﬁcant difference in
developmental rates of blastocysts between 2n and 4n embryos (P > 0.05), suggesting that the blas-
tocyst forming capacity in 4n embryos is similar to those in 2n embryos. Moreover, 4n/2n chimeric
embryos were obtained by aggregation of 4n and 2n embryos. We found that the developmental
rate and cell number of blastocysts of 4-cell (4n)/4-cell (2n) chimeric embryos were signiﬁcantly
higher than those of 2-cell (4n)/4-cell (2n), 4-cell (4n)/8-cell (2n), 4-cell (4n)/2-cell (2n) chimeric
embryos (P < 0.05). Consistent with mouse chimeras, the majority of 4n cells contribute to the
trophectoderm (TE), while the 2n cells are mainly present in the inner cell mass (ICM) of porcine
4n/2n chimeric embryos. Our study established a feasible and efﬁcient approach to produce porcine
4n embryos and 4n/2n chimeric embryos.

Recent discoveries in reproductive biotechnology have en-
hanced the potential uses of genetically modiﬁed pigs in
the biomedical ﬁeld with the purpose of improving human
lives [1]. Tetraploid (4n) embryos are used to produce chime-
ras with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and diploid (2n) em-
bryos, which have been used to substitute microinjection

of DNA and nuclear transfer for the creation of genetically
modiﬁed animals [2,3].

4n embryos have been obtained by using many different
methods, such as fusion of 2-cell stage embryos, or by using
cytochalasin B or colchicine to inhibit cell division [4–7].
The most efﬁcient method to produce 4n embryos in many
species seems to be the fusion of 2-cell embryos stimulated
by electrofusion [8–15]. However, the conditions for produc-
ing porcine 4n embryos needed to be optimized and the
development of porcine 4n embryos has not been well
addressed.

Directly injecting ESCs into 4n blastocysts or co-culturing
ESCs with 4n embryos can generate mice completely derived
from ESCs [16,17]. Using inner cell mass (ICM) cells or 2n
embryos seem like an approachable way for species in which
ESCs are not yet available. Compared to injection of ICM
cells into embryos at the blastocyst stage, 4n/2n aggregation
is a more efﬁcient approach to produce 4n/2n chimeric em-
bryos [18]. In mice, 4n/2n chimeras typically express a re-
stricted
[19,20].
Nonetheless,
in some uncommon 4n/2n chimeras, 4n cells
contributed to the ICM due to the signiﬁcant differences of
the stage and the proportion of aggregated 4n and 2n em-
bryos. The restricted distribution of 4n cells in chimeras has
been performed experimentally to directly produce mice from
ESCs by 4n complementation [16,17]. However, it has not
been demonstrated in other species yet.

trophectoderm (TE)/ICM distribution

In this study, we explored the optimum condition for elec-
trofusion of 2-cell embryos to produce porcine 4n embryos
and systematically demonstrated the development of 4n em-
bryos. We also tested the in vitro development and distribu-
tion pattern of 4n and 2n cells of chimeric embryos, along
with the TE/ICM distribution of porcine 4n/2n chimeras.

Results

4n embryo production and chromosomal analysis

To optimize the conditions for production of porcine 4n em-
bryos, different electric ﬁeld intensities, including 0, 0.3, 0.6,
0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8 and 2.1 kV/cm were tested to fuse 2n 2-cell em-
bryos. Compared to 0.3, 0.6, 2.1 kV/cm voltages, the fusion
rates of 0.9, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8 kV/cm voltages were signiﬁcantly
higher (P < 0.05), and the rates of development to blastocyst
of presumably 4n embryos were signiﬁcantly higher when
using 0.9 and 1.2 electric ﬁeld intensities (P < 0.05). However,
delayed 4n embryos were found when 1.2 kV/cm was used in
comparison to when 0.9 kV/cm was used (P < 0.05; Table 1).
These results indicate that the optimum condition for electro-
fusion of 2-cell embryos to produce porcine 4n embryos is
2DC pulses at 0.9 kV/cm for 30 ls. Furthermore, we evaluated
the ploidy of control embryos, presumably 2n and fused em-
bryos at the blastocyst stage by FISH (Table 2; Figure 1).
Among the 20 control blastocysts subjected to chromosomal
analysis, 19 embryos were diploid and one embryo was a mo-
saic of diploid and tetraploid cells. In fused presumably 4n em-
bryos, 15 out of 22 embryos were tetraploid, six embryos were
diploid, and one embryo was a mosaic of diploid and tetra-
ploid cells. These results indicate that a majority of embryos
fused under the optimum condition were tetraploid embryos.

Development of 4n embryos

2n embryos were recovered at the 1-cell stage while 4n embryos
were obtained by fusion of the newly recovered 2-cell embryos.
The developmental characteristics of the 2n and 4n embryos
were compared in vitro (Table 3). Under the optimum condi-
tions, the development of 2n embryos was signiﬁcantly faster
than 4n embryos at the cleavage stage (P < 0.05). However,
the timing of blastocyst formation of 2n and 4n was very sim-
ilar and the rates of blastocyst formation between 2n and 4n
were not signiﬁcantly different (23.61 vs. 22.84, respectively;
P > 0.05). As expected, the number of blastomeres in 4n blas-
tocysts was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the 2n embryos
(P < 0.05), indicating that the small number of blastomeres
did not affect in vitro development capability of 4n embryos.
Taken together, these data suggest that the competence of 4n
embryos for developing into blastocyst is the same as 2n
embryos.

Production of 4n/2n chimeras and distribution pattern analysis

Pairs of 4n and 2n zona-free embryos at different development
stages were aggregated in individual micro-wells to produce
4n/2n chimeric embryos (Figure 2) and the development char-
acteristics of chimeric embryos were checked. The blastocyst
formation rate and the cell number of 4-cell (4n)/4-cell (2n)
chimeric embryos were signiﬁcantly higher than other groups
(Table 4; P < 0.05), suggesting that the optimum time frame
to obtain chimera by aggregation is when embryos are at the
4-cell stage. To clearly demonstrate the distribution pattern
of 4n and 2n cells in porcine chimeric embryos, two distinct
series of 4n/2n (GFP4n/2n and 4n/GFP2n) were cultured
in vitro and analyzed at the blastocyst stage. In 4n/GFP 2n chi-
meras, the GFP positive cells mainly contributed to the ICM,
whereas in the ﬁve GFP4n/2n chimeric blastocysts examined,
GFP positive cells were present in the TE (Figure 3). These re-
sults indicated that the development pattern of porcine 4n/2n
chimeric embryos is similar to that of mouse 4n/2n chimera,
in which the majority of 4n cells contribute to the TE, whereas
the 2n cells mainly locate in the ICM.

Discussion

further

The electrofusion of 2-cell embryos prove to be a simple and
efﬁcient way of generating mammalian 4n embryos. Many fac-
tors affect the fusion efﬁciency, such as fusion medium, electric
ﬁeld intensity and fusion pulse length [10,21–23]. In mice, pro-
duction of 4n embryos by electrofusion has already been inves-
tigated [4], however,
investigation of optimum
conditions to produce porcine 4n embryos is still needed. In
this study, the optimum condition for generating porcine 4n
embryos by electrofusion of 2-cell embryos is 2DC pulses of
0.9 kV/cm for 30 ls, which leads to a comparably high fusion
rate. Thus, it appears to be more stable to produce 4n embryos
by fusing freshly recovered 2-cell embryos in pigs. Further-
more, the cell number in 4n blastocysts was signiﬁcantly lower
than control 2n embryos. This may be attributed to the one
less cell cycle of 4n embryos developing to blastocysts com-
pared to 2n embryos, though the blastocyst formation rate

FISH analysis of ploidy of porcine IVF embryos

of 4n embryos was similar to the control. Similar to other stud-
ies, we conﬁrmed the high preimplantation development
capacity of porcine 4n embryos as other mammalian 4n em-
bryos [24].

Karyotyping analysis showed that the electrofused 2-cell
embryos exhibited signiﬁcant species variances in their ploidy.
Uniform 4n cells were found at the blastocyst stage of fused
embryos in mice and rats [15]. However, in cattle, only some
embryos displayed uniform 4n cells at the morula and blasto-
cyst stage, whereas most of the embryos were 2n or 2n/4n
mosaics [25]. In pigs, about 50% of blastocysts produced by
electrofusion of 2-cell embryos were 4n status [13]. These re-
sults indicate that 68% of the fused embryos display a devia-
tion of the predicted ploidy and 27% of the fused embryos
remained 2n. The reasons for discrepancy among these species
are not quite clear. It has been proposed that the functional
centrosomes exist during the early stages of cleavage in fused
porcine and bovine embryos, which may render the embryos
more prone to forming a disorganized bipolar or tripolar spin-
dles. However, lack of centrioles in mouse embryos, up until
the blastocyst stage, may cause the 4n embryos to develop after

fusing normally. So the high rate of dipoid embryos may occur
in fused bovine and porcine embryos by unsuccessfully com-
bining the two sets of 2n chromosomes after fusion.

4n embryos cannot complete normal development indepen-
dently [8,26]. However, when complemented with the ICM,
ESCs or 2n embryos, 4n embryos can develop into conceptus-
es, in which embryonic lineages are derived entirely from the
ICM, ESCs or 2n embryos, while the 4n component largely
form extraembryonic lineages [20,27]. In this study, the porcine
4n embryos were complemented by aggregation with normal
2n embryos. It has been reported that embryo development
stage, cell number and cell size could affect the aggregation
of embryos [28–30]. In mice, aggregation of 2n embryos is
often performed at the 8-cell stage, just before compaction,
and 4n/2n chimera are often produced with the 8-cell stage
of 2n embryos and 4-cell stage of 4n embryos. Also, it has been
reported that high yields of chimeric blastocysts could be
achieved by aggregating the ICM with 4–8 cell-stage or moru-
lae parthenogenetic embryos in pigs [31]. In this report, by
evaluating the developmental rate and the cell number of the
blastocyst, we found that the combination of 4-cell stage 4n

embryos with 4-cell stage 2n embryos can provide the best re-
sults for generating 4n/2n chimera in pig, which is different
from what happens in mice.

By analyzing the 4n/2n chimera development, we found
that 4n embryos at the 4-cell stage, when aggregated with 2n
embryos at the 4-cell stage, produced the best developmental
rate of blastocysts that also have more cells. Although an in-
depth study has not yet been performed, we speculate that 4-
cell stage embryos may aggregate together with high efﬁciency,
resulting in the same embryo development stage with the same
cell number and similar cell size. Comparatively, 2n embryos,
at the 8-cell stage, when aggregated with 4n embryos at the 4-
cell stage, generated blastocysts at lower development rates

and cell numbers in vitro. This indicates that embryos at later
stages may not be the best for producing chimeric embryos by
aggregation compared to early cleavage embryos. However, la-
ter stage embryos can be used to form chimeric embryos by
using other methods, such as the blastocyst injection method
[32].

In the 15 4n/2n porcine chimeric embryos we analyzed, the 4n
cells and 2n cells contributed to the TE and ICM, respectively.
This development pattern is consistent with 4n/2n chimera mice.
4n cells in the blastocyst are preferentially selected to locate in
the TE, rather than in the ICM. It is still not clear how the
ICM is selective against 4n cells. The selective differentiation
of these two types of blastomeres in 4n/2n chimera may involve

competition between them. One explanation for the occurrence
of this phenomenon is that 4n cells may be less competent in
turning into embryonic tissues. This interpretation is supported
by observations that independent 4n embryos fail to produce or-
ganized embryos after implantation [8,26]. Moreover, preim-
plantation embryos of pigs,
sheep, cattle and humans
frequently contain polyploid cells, which are more abundant in
the TE than the ICM in the blastocyst [20,33]. With the support
of previous data and the results we found in this study, we con-
clude that in most mammalian embryos, 4n or polyploid blasto-
meres generally are apt to contribute to the TE. This will be

helpful to produce genetically modiﬁed animals through the
same route widely used in mice.

Materials and methods

In vitro maturation of oocytes

The procedure for in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oo-
cytes was described as followed. Porcine ovaries were received
and transported at 30–35 °C, and an 18-gauge needle was used
to aspirate follicular ﬂuid from 3 to 6 mm follicles. Cumulus–
oocyte complexes (COCs) with uniform cytoplasm and several
layers of cumulus cells were selected and rinsed three times in
Tyrode lactate-Hepes plus polyvinyl alchohol (PVA). The
COCs were cultured in a 4-well dish containing TCM-199
medium for 42–44 h at 38.5 °C as described previously [34].

In vitro fertilization and embryo culture

Porcine in vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed as described
previously [35]. Brieﬂy, the semen was washed three times in
Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented
with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) by centrifuga-
tion at 1500g for 3 min. The spermatozoa concentration and
the proportion of motile sperm were determined by using a
hemocytometer and sperm was diluted with the modiﬁed
Tris-buffered medium (mTBM). Matured oocytes at 42 h of
IVM were washed three times in mTBM. Approximately 30
oocytes were inseminated in 50 ll mTBM containing sperms
at a ﬁnal concentration of 3 · 105/ml for 6 h [35].

The embryos were cultured in porcine zygote medium-3
(PZM-3) at 38.5 °C. The cleavage and blastocyst rates were as-
sessed at 48 h and 156 h after activation, and the number
of blastocyst cells was evaluated by nuclear staining with
5 lg/ml Hoechst 33342.

and

PCR using Alexa 546-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) with the primer sets 50GTTGCACTTTCACGGACG-
CAGC30
50CTAGCCCATTGCTCGCCATAGC30.
RNase and pepsin were used to treat the embryos on slides,
which were then dehydrated in an ethanol series and denatured
by incubation in 70% paraformaldehyde in 2· SSC solution at
70 °C for 3 min. After dehydration, the denatured probe was
applied onto slides and incubated overnight at 37 °C before
washes [36]. Following Hoechst 33342 staining, slides were
mounted with Prolong gold antifade reagent
(Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and analyzed using Nikon Eclipse 80i
epiﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Embryos labeling and distribution pattern analysis of chimeric
blastocysts

PgcFU GFP lentivirus (titer at 2 · 109 IU/ml), purchased from
Shanghai Genechem, was injected into the perivitelline space of
1-cell embryos with FemtiJet express Microinjector (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) to label 2n and 4n embryos. The GFP4n/
2n and 4n/GFP 2n chimeric embryos were produced by aggre-
gation. Chimeric blastocysts were examined under a Nikon
Eclipse 80i epiﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0. Data are
shown as the mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was used to as-
sess any differences between groups. The Duncan method was
employed for pairwise comparisons, followed by a Bonferroni
correction. P < 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically
signiﬁcant [37].

CaCl2. Using an AC ﬁeld of 6 V and 10 s, embryos were
aligned in the chamber with their fusion plane parallel to the
electrodes. 2DC electro pulses of different electric ﬁeld intensi-
ties (0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8 and 2.1 kV/cm) for 30 ls on a
BTX Elector-Cell Manipulator 2001 (BTX, San Diego, CA)
were used to induce blastomere fusion. 30 min after electrofu-
sion, the fusion rate was evaluated and the fused embryos were
cultured in PZM-3 as described above.

Zona pellucida of embryos was removed by proteinase K
(PK). Pairs of zona-free 4n and 2n embryos with different
stages were pushed together in individual micro-well
in
PZM-3 to produce 4n/2n chimeric embryos.

FISH assay

Embryos were washed in TCM199 to remove embryo culture
medium and suspended in hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl).
After being ﬁxed with cold acetic acid/methanol solution (v/v
1:3) to dissolve cytoplasm, the embryo was transferred to a
slide and frozen in  20 °C for at least 24 h. A 245-bp probe
for porcine chromosome 1 was ampliﬁed and labeled by
