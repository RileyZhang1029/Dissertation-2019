ABSTRACT
Summary: A variety of specialist databases have been developed
to facilitate the study of allergens. However, these databases either
contain different subsets of allergen data or are deﬁcient in tools
for assessing potential allergenicity of proteins. Here, we describe
Allergen Atlas, a comprehensive repository of experimentally
validated allergen sequences collected from in-house laboratory,
online data submission, literature reports and all existing general-
purpose and specialist databases. Each entry was manually veriﬁed,
classiﬁed and hyperlinked to major databases including Swiss-
Prot, Protein Data Bank (PDB), Gene Ontology (GO), Pfam and
PubMed. The database is integrated with analysis tools that
include: (i) keyword search, (ii) BLAST, (iii) position-speciﬁc iterative
BLAST (PSI-BLAST),
(v) graphical
representation of allergen information network and (vi) online data
submission. The latest version contains information of 1593 allergen
sequences (496 IUIS allergens, 978 experimentally veriﬁed allergens
and 119 new sequences), 56 IgE epitope sequences, 679 links to
PDB structures and 155 links to Pfam domains.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the last decade, a variety of specialized databases have been
developed to facilitate the study of allergens (Brusic et al.,
2003). Some of these databases contain basic allergen sequences
and related information (Bairoch et al., 2004; Gendel, 1998),
some have basic sequence comparison tools (Wu et al., 2006),
while others have additional tools (Hileman et al., 2002) for the
assessment of allergenicity based on the FAO/WHO expert group
recommendations (Gendel, 2004). Each of these databases has a
different focus with emphasis on different groups of allergens.
Databases such as Bioinformatics for Food Safety (Gendel, 1998),
Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (Hileman et al.,
2002) and International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS)
Nomenclature Sub-Committee Allergen Database (King et al.,
1994) are rich in content but contain different subsets of allergen

sequences. The majority of these databases either lack complete
information on available allergens or are deﬁcient in bioinformatic
tools for analyzing the stored sequences. Other databases, including
Allergome (Mari et al., 2005) and SDAP (Ivanciuc et al., 2003)
contain putative allergens annotated using sequence similarity to
the veriﬁed allergens.

To ﬁll this important gap in existing resources, we report Allergen
Atlas, a comprehensive repository of allergen data collected from
in-house laboratory, online data submission, literature reports and
all existing general-purpose and specialist databases. The database
is integrated with a suite of bioinformatic tools to facilitate
data analysis, visualization and retrieval, including keyword and
sequence similarity searches. The main purpose of Allergen Atlas
is to support molecular studies of allergens, assessment of allergic
responses and of allergic cross-reactivity.

2 METHODS
2.1 Construction and Implementation
Allergen Atlas is a manually curated PostgreSQL (www.postgresql.org)
database hosted on a Linux server. It contains experimentally determined
allergen information from in-house laboratory, online submission, literature
reports and all existing general-purpose and specialist databases. The most
important characteristics of allergens were extracted, manually veriﬁed,
classiﬁed and stored in the database. Each entry is annotated with the
following information, where available: (i) allergen name, (ii) scientiﬁc
and common names of the source organisms, (iii) type, (iv) sequence,
(v) bibliographic references, (vi) IgE epitope sequence and (vii) allergen
public database accessions that include Swiss-Prot (Boeckmann et al., 2003),
Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., 2000), Gene Ontology (GO;
The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000), Pfam(Bateman et al., 2002) and
PubMed. IgE epitopes of known allergens were extracted from Bcipep
(Saha et al., 2005). Swiss-Prot and PDB provide well-deﬁned sequence and
structure information, respectively; GO provides a description of gene and
gene product attributes; while Pfam details information about the protein
domains and families of existing allergens. This information is included for
comprehensiveness in coverage.

3.1 Database contents
A total of 1593 experimentally validated allergens with their
sequence information were stored in Allergen Atlas. A signiﬁcant

portion of these sequences (119/1593 or 7.5%) were experimentally
determined in our in-house laboratory and remain as unpublished
results. In addition, the database contains entries of 496 IUIS
allergens, 978 non-IUIS allergens, 56 IgE epitopes, 679 links to
PDB structures and 155 links to Pfam domains collected through
exhaustive manual searching of primary literature, as well as general
and specialist databases.

3.2 Capabilities
The Allergen Atlas web interface allows for keyword search as well
as sequence similarity searches of stored allergens.

A text-based keyword search function permits general survey of
speciﬁc allergens stored in the database. Users can query the
database based on allergen name, organism name, pathway or bib-
liographical references. Cross-reference searches can be performed
using GO accession, Pfam accession or Swiss-Prot accession.

BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) is a local sequence comparison
tool that outputs information on allergens containing similar regions
with the query sequence. BLAST searches allow users to identify
matching or similar sequences and display the results in the form of
a table. A variant of BLAST, the position-speciﬁc iterative BLAST
(PSI-BLAST; Altschul et al., 1997), is also included in Allergen
Atlas to facilitate the identiﬁcation of weak relationships of the
query sequence to annotated entries in the database which may not
detected by a BLAST search. Recent studies have shown that this
approach can predict allergens with up to 95.02% accuracy (Lim
et al., in press).

The FAO/WHO criteria search is a sequence similarity search tool
for assessing potential allergenicity of proteins in accordance to the
current FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius guidelines which comprises
of two rules—rule 1: a sequence identity of six consecutive
amino acids between the sequences of the query protein and an
experimentally veriﬁed allergen; or rule 2: a sequence identity of
>35% over a stretch of 80 amino acids (FAO/WHO, 2003). This
approach has been adopted by numerous research groups including
Fiers et al. (2004) and Gendel(1998). However, concerns have been
raised that the precision was reportedly low for methods solely
relying on the six amino acid rule (Silvanovich et al., 2006). Allergen
Atlas allows for more stringent searches of the FAO/WHO protocol
by allowing users to deﬁne input parameters such as the number of
contiguous amino acids for screening (rule 1) as well as the sequence
identity threshold (rule 2).

To facilitate data interpretation, users are provided capabilities
for displaying the relationships of allergen data using a graphical
visualization module. Given a list of selected entries returned from
a search query, users can select a list of display options including
(i) allergen name, (ii) organism name, (iii) Swiss-Prot accession,
(iv) PDB accession, (v) GO accession, (vi) Pfam accession, (vii) IgE
epitope and (viii) IgG epitope. The graphical visualization module
allows for the display of an allergen information network based on
the selected entries and annotations.

4 CONCLUSION
Allergen Atlas has been developed to facilitate research in
allergology. To enhance the usefulness of this resource, newly

980

validated allergen sequences from our in-house laboratory, and
primary literature will be constantly added to the database. We look
forward to the day when researchers worldwide will voluntarily
share their experimental data and upload their ﬁndings to an online
repository, such as ours, much as today where we upload our
own experimental data to share with the research community. An
online submission website was speciﬁcally developed for such a
purpose. In addition to high quality data, essential analytical tool
resources that are widely accepted in the scientiﬁc community are
also provided in Allergen Atlas. The list of bioinformatic tools will be
periodically updated based on input from the scientiﬁc community.
With advances in clinical allergology, genomics and proteomics, we
envision a future in which large amounts of data will be available
for the study of allergens, which will be included in Allergen Atlas
and provided to the research community.
