ABSTRACT
Summary: The microbial protein interaction database (MPIDB) aims
to collect and provide all known physical microbial
interactions.
Currently, 22 530 experimentally determined interactions among
proteins of 191 bacterial species/strains can be browsed and
downloaded. These microbial
interactions have been manually
curated from the literature or imported from other databases (IntAct,
DIP, BIND, MINT) and are linked to 24 060 experimental evidences
(PubMed ID, PSI-MI methods).
In contrast to these databases,
interactions in MPIDB are further supported by 8150 additional
evidences based on interaction conservation, co-puriﬁcation and 3D
domain contacts (iPfam, 3did).

1 INTRODUCTION
As of today, about 600 bacteria have been completely sequenced
and fragments of thousands of others have been determined as
part of metagenomics projects (http://www.genomesonline.org/).
Relationships among these genes and proteins are now being
determined in a systematic manner. One such relationship that can
be measured experimentally is a physical interaction between two
proteins. High-throughput methods have generated large interaction
networks. Such datasets have not only been shown to reveal
functional clues about hypothetical proteins (Titz et al., 2008), but
also that highly connected proteins are important for survival—
a fact that makes them ideal targets for antibiotics (Jeong et al.,
2001). Several databases have been established for interaction data
(Table 1). In addition to experimental data, databases such as
STRING (Von Mering et al., 2007) provide predicted interactions.
However, except for the latter, there is a signiﬁcant bias towards
eukaryotes. Furthermore, there is surprisingly little overlap between
different databases. Hence users need to download and combine
several microbial datasets.

The aforementioned databases have other shortcomings: none of
them provides information on whether an interaction is conserved in
another species and how similar the homologous proteins are. They
do not include domain pairs that are known to form close contacts in
3D structures. Some even do not allow to search for species-speciﬁc
information or only to a very limited extent, e.g. IntAct currently
provides only searches for cryptic species abbreviations or NCBI
taxon ids.

We describe the microbial protein interaction database (MPIDB),
a new web resource that addresses such questions and provides
uniﬁed access to available microbial interaction data.

2 MICROBIAL INTERACTION EVIDENCES
Protein–protein interactions are deﬁned as unique pairs of
microbial UniProt accessions (UniProt Consortium, 2008). For each
interaction, MPIDB features experimental and additional evidences
(Fig. 1). An interaction is reported if there is at least one experimental
evidence.

2.1 Experimental evidences
Experimental evidences are based on interaction experiments that
identify two physically associated proteins. An evidence is deﬁned
by its interaction detection method [PSI-MI vocabulary (Kerrien
et al., 2007a)] in combination with its publication. Interactions
from pull-down studies were only included if a bait protein puriﬁed
only one prey protein. Overall, we integrated 24 060 experimental
evidences from the scientiﬁc literature (MPI-LIT), from in-house
two-hybrid experiments (MPI-EXP) and from other databases
(Table 1). These experiments describe a unique set of 22 530
protein–protein interactions.

2.2 Additional evidences
Interactions were used to identify homologous
interactions
(interologs) in the same or different species. A protein sequence
revealed 5465 interolog
comparison of
−5,
evidences among 110 species/strains (BLAST E-value ≤10
Fig. 1A). Interacting proteins were co-puriﬁed by 1029 pull-down
experiments (bait–prey or prey–prey, Fig. 1B) and 1441 Pfam
domain combinations among interacting proteins have been found
to form close contacts in 3D structures [iPfam (Finn et al., 2005),
3did (Stein et al., 2005), Fig. 1C]. Whenever an interaction from
another study is mentioned in an article without experimental
evidence in the same paper, we add the referenced study as a
‘secondary reference’(Fig. 1D). Finally, multimeric 3D structures
were integrated whenever both interacting proteins were part of a
protein complex (homodimers have been excluded, Fig. 1E).

3 WEB INTERFACE
MPIDB can be searched by species/strain and/or by protein names
(common gene name, ordered locus name and UniProt accession).
More speciﬁc requests may be made using the advanced search
option. Found interactions are displayed as protein pairs ordered
by supporting interaction evidences. Lists of interactions may be
downloaded as PSI-MI tab delimited ﬁles and can be imported by
visualization tools, such as Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/).
Clicking on the number of evidences shows experimental and
additional evidences along with links to the source databases.

4 DISCUSSION
Experimental and/or predicted protein interactions are provided
by several publicly available databases. Although some of them
feature microbial interactions, the majority emphasise eukaryotic
interactions while none of them provide access to all microbial

data: each database stores interactions that are not reported by
another
(see No. of Unique interactions in Table 1). While
features of these databases have inﬂuenced MPIDB, its manual
literature curation efforts [meanwhile as an IMEx observer member
(http://imex.sourceforge.net/)] and supporting evidences such as
interologs and domain–domain interactions are unique to our
database. In contrast to other repositories, we do not include binary
interactions infered from pull-down experiments. While STRING
predicts interactions de novo, we treat predictions with caution and
only add them as additional evidences to experimentally veriﬁed
ones. Finally, users are requested to suggest additional features of
interest.

Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.
