ABSTRACT
Motivation: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cancer require
personalized therapies owing to their inherent heterogeneous nature.
For both diseases, large-scale pharmacogenomic screens of molecu-
larly characterized samples have been generated with the hope of
identifying genetic predictors of drug susceptibility. Thus, computa-
tional algorithms capable of
inferring robust predictors of drug
responses from genomic information are of great practical importance.
Most of the existing computational studies that consider drug suscep-
tibility prediction against a panel of drugs formulate a separate learning
problem for each drug, which cannot make use of commonalities be-
tween subsets of drugs.
Results: In this study, we propose to solve the problem of drug sus-
ceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs in a multitask learning
framework by formulating a novel Bayesian algorithm that combines
kernel-based non-linear dimensionality reduction and binary classifi-
cation (or regression). The main novelty of our method is the joint
Bayesian formulation of projecting data points into a shared subspace
and learning predictive models for all drugs in this subspace, which
helps us to eliminate off-target effects and drug-specific experimental
noise. Another novelty of our method is the ability of handling missing
phenotype values owing to experimental conditions and quality control
reasons. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm via cross-
validation experiments on two benchmark drug susceptibility datasets
of HIV and cancer. Our method obtains statistically significantly better
predictive performance on most of the drugs compared with baseline
single-task algorithms that learn drug-specific models. These results
show that predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of drugs
simultaneously within a multitask learning framework improves overall
predictive performance over single-task learning approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cancer, which are
two major human diseases causing millions of deaths yearly,
require ‘personalized therapies’ owing to their inherent heter-
ogenous nature. For both diseases, large-scale pharmacogenomic

screens have been performed with the hope of discovering asso-
ciations between genetic subtypes of each disease and drug
susceptibility (Barretina et al., 2012; Garnett et al., 2012; Rhee
et al., 2003).

HIV is usually treated with antiretroviral therapies, which
have demonstrated high efficacy. However, the high mutation
rate of HIV helps the virus adapt fast, leading to drug-resistant
viral strains. Thus, selecting the optimal therapeutic regimen for
a given HIV strain requires the ability to predict drug resistance
based on its genomic sequence. To enable this type of discovery,
Rhee et al. (2003) characterize the susceptibility of 41000
genomically sequenced HIV strains to subsets of multiple HIV
therapeutic agents.

Cancer is a collection of genetically diverse diseases, and many
modern cancer therapeutics have demonstrated selective efficacy
in specific matched genetic subtypes (Druker et al., 2001). Thus,
patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapeutics
require the ability to predict drug sensitivity based on molecular
information about a patient’s tumor. For this purpose, Barretina
et al. (2012) and Garnett et al. (2012) characterize the sensitivity
of 4500 molecularly profiled cancer cell lines to 24 and 138
anticancer compounds, respectively.

For both HIV and cancer, researchers have developed
genomic predictors of drug susceptibility using modern machine
learning techniques for high-dimensional classification or regres-
sion. For example, Rhee et al. (2006) use machine learning algo-
rithms such as decision trees, artificial neural networks, support
vector machines, least squares regression and least angle regres-
sion to predict drug resistance in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) using the
sequence of the viral reverse transcriptase. Barretina et al. (2012)
and Garnett et al. (2012) use a regularized regression method
(elastic net) to predict drug sensitivities based on cancer cell
line molecular profiles, and Neto et al. (2014) formulate a
Bayesian extension of this approach in a recent study. Menden
et al. (2013) combine genomic features of cell lines and chemical
features of drugs for sensitivity prediction using a neural network
approach. Jang et al. (2014) and Papillon-Cavanagh et al. (2013)
compare the performance of various machine learning methods
applied to the cancer cell line datasets.

One potential limitation of these approaches is the formulation
of a separate learning task for each drug. In particular, because
each pharmacogenomic screen profiles multiple drugs with simi-
lar mechanisms of action, leveraging information across multiple
related drugs may yield improved model robustness by reducing
the impact of ‘off-target effects’ and drug-specific experimental
noise. Moreover, methods that jointly model sensitivity profiles
across multiple drugs may yield insights into groups of drugs
effecting similar biological processes or infer mechanisms of
action for uncharacterized compounds. For example, Wei et al.
(2012) combine elastic net regression with an expectation

maximization algorithm to simultaneously cluster groups of
similarly behaving compounds and infer a predictive model for
each cluster. Heider et al. (2013) formulate predicting drug re-
sistance against a panel of HIV-1 drugs as a ‘multilabel learning’
problem (Tsoumakas et al., 2010), which aims to use all available
information by learning models for all drugs simultaneously.
They show that this joint modeling approach is better than in-
dependent modeling in terms of predictive performance.
However, their algorithm has some limitations: (i) It is based
on the classifier chains formulation (i.e. training separate pre-
dictors for all drugs successively linked along a chain) (Read
et al., 2011), which is not sufficient to capture more complex
dependencies between drugs. (ii) It assumes that each data
point have the corresponding drug resistance score for all of
the drugs considered (i.e. no missing output), which limits the
applicability of the proposed method because,
in large-scale
pharmacogenomic assays, there may be many missing values
owing to experimental conditions, quality control reasons, etc.

For predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of drugs, we
propose a novel Bayesian formulation that combines kernel-
based non-linear dimensionality reduction (Sch €olkopf and
Smola, 2002) and binary classification (or regression) in a ‘multi-
task learning’ framework (Caruana, 1997), which tries to solve
distinct but related tasks jointly to improve overall generalization
performance. Our proposed method, called ‘kernelized Bayesian
multitask learning’ (KBMTL), has two key properties: (i) It
maps all data points into a shared subspace and learns predictive
models for all drugs simultaneously in this subspace to capture
commonalities between the drugs. Joint modeling of drugs en-
ables us to eliminate off-target effects and drug-specific experi-
mental noise, leading to a better predictive performance. (ii) It
can handle missing values of drug susceptibility measurements,
which enables us not to discard data points with missing outputs,
leading to larger data collections. As a result, the obtained pre-
dictions become more robust especially for drugs with a large
number of missing phenotype values.

To show the performance gain of our method over standard
modeling approaches, we perform cross-validation experiments
on two benchmark drug susceptibility datasets of HIV and
cancer.

2 MATERIALS

In this study, we use two different drug susceptibility datasets, which we
extract from the following sources: (i) HIV Drug Resistance Database
(HIVDB) (Rhee et al., 2003), (ii) Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in
Cancer (GDSC) (Yang et al., 2013). These two data sources are publicly
available at http://hivdb.stanford.edu and http://www.cancerrxgene.org,
respectively.

2.1 HIV drug resistance database

HIVDB contains phenotype and genotype information about HIV-1 (i.e.
viral reverse transcriptase sequences with corresponding susceptibility re-
sults and amino acid sequences). We extract all reverse transcriptase
sequences originated from subtype B strains, which gives us 970 reverse
transcriptase sequences in total. We use drug susceptibility results mea-
sured using the PhenoSense method for eight nucleoside analogs, namely,
Lamivudine (3TC), Abacavir (ABC), Zidovudine (AZT), Stavudine
(d4T), Zalcitabine (ddC), Didanosine (ddI), Tenofovir (TDF) and

Drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs

Emtricitabine (FTC). Drug susceptibility results are given as fold
change in susceptibility (i.e. standardized measure of HIV drug resist-
ance), which is defined as

IC50 ratio =

IC50 of an isolate

IC50 of a standard wild-type control isolate

where IC50 of a resistant or wild-type control isolate gives its half max-
imal inhibitory concentration. We label reverse transcriptase sequences as
‘resistant’ or ‘susceptible’ using drug-specific cutoff values as done simi-
larly in the earlier studies (Heider et al., 2013; Rhee et al., 2006). The
cutoff is set to 1.5 for d4T, ddC, ddI and TDF, and to 3.0 for 3TC, ABC,
AZT and FTC. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the drug resistance labels
and the histogram of available IC50 ratios for 970 reverse transcriptase
sequences.

We remove the sequences with no phenotype information (i.e. 48 re-
verse transcriptase sequences with no IC50 ratios), leading to a final
dataset with 922 reverse transcriptase sequences. Table 1 summarizes
the final dataset by listing the drug name, the corresponding analog,
the number of reverse transcriptase sequences with measured IC50
ratio, the IC50 ratio cutoff and the ratio between resistant and susceptible
classes for each drug.

For each reverse transcriptase, genotype information is extracted from
the amino acid sequence of positions 1–240. Amino acid differences from
the subtype B consensus wild-type sequence are considered as mutations.
There are 1474 unique mutations for 922 reverse transcriptase sequences
in our dataset, which means each reverse transcriptase sequence can be
represented as a 1474-dimensional binary vector.

2.2 Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer

GDSC contains phenotype and genotype information about cancer (i.e.
cancer cell lines with corresponding sensitivity results and genomic pro-
files). We use drug sensitivity results measured against 138 anticancer
drugs, which are given in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) and area under the dose–response curve (AUC) values. We choose
to perform our analysis on AUC values because IC50 values are not
observed before the maximum screening concentration for a significant
proportion of the drug and cell line pairs (i.e. most of the cell lines are
resistant to a given drug within the range of experimental screening con-
centrations). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the AUC values and the
histogram of available dose–response curves for 790 cancer cell lines.

GDSC contains genomic profiles in the forms of copy number vari-
ation, gene expression and mutation profiles. We choose to use only gene
expression, as it is shown to be the most informative data source in earlier
studies (Jang et al., 2014). Gene expression profile is extracted from
hybridized RNA in HT-HGU133A Affymetrix whole genome array.

There are 12 024 normalized gene expression intensities generated using
the MAS5 algorithm (Hubbell et al., 2002), which means each cell line can
be represented as a 12 024-dimensional real-valued vector.

We remove the cell lines with no phenotype or genotype information,

leading to a final dataset with 664 cell lines and 138 drugs.

3 METHODS

We consider the problem of predicting susceptibility against a panel of
drugs simultaneously for each data point, which is a viral reverse tran-
scriptase for the HIV dataset and a cell line for the cancer dataset. Instead
of training drug-specific models separately, we choose to solve this
problem with a multitask learning formulation by considering each
drug as a distinct task and learning a unified model for all tasks
conjointly. We first discuss our proposed method for binary classification
(i.e. classifying a data point as resistant or susceptible) in detail and then
briefly mention how we extend our method to regression (i.e. predicting
real-valued sensitivity measures such as IC50 or AUC).

3.1 Problem formulation
We assume that there are T related binary classification tasks defined on
the domain X . We are given an independent and identically distributed
sample X = fxi 2 XgN
i=1. For each task, we are given a label vector
yt=fyt;i 2 f 1; +1ggi2I t
, where I t gives the indices of data points with
given class labels in task t. There is a kernel function to define similarities
between the data points, i.e. k : X  X ! R, which is used to calculate
the kernel matrix K=fkðxi; xjÞgN;N

i=1;j=1.

Figure 1 illustrates the method we propose to learn a conjoint model
across the tasks; it is composed of two main parts: (i) projecting data
points into a shared subspace using a ‘kernel-based dimensionality reduc-
tion’ model and (ii) performing ‘binary classification’ in this subspace
using the task-specific classification parameters. We first briefly explain
these two parts and introduce the notation used.

matrix K 2 RNN and the projection matrix A 2 RNR, where N is the
number of data points and R is the subspace dimensionality. When we
map the data points into a low dimensional latent subspace using the
projection matrix A, we obtain their hidden representations in this shared
>
subspace, i.e. H=A
K. Using a kernel-based formulation has three main
implications: (i) We can apply our method to tasks with high dimensional
representations such as genomic information and small sample size
(i.e. large p, small n). (ii) We can learn better subspaces using non-linear
kernels such as the Gaussian kernel (i.e. kernel trick). (iii) We can use
domain-specific kernels (e.g. graph and tree kernels for structured objects)

3.2 Kernelized Bayesian multitask learning
We formulate a probabilistic model, called KBMTL, for the method
described earlier. We can derive an efficient inference algorithm using
variational approximation because our method combines the kernel-
based dimensionality reduction and task-specific classification parts
with a fully conjugate probabilistic model.

Figure 2 gives the graphical model of KBMTL with hyper-parameters,
priors, latent variables and model parameters. As described earlier, the
main idea can be summarized as (i) finding hidden representations for the
data points by mapping them into a subspace with the help of kernel and
projection matrices and (ii) performing binary classification in this shared
subspace using the task-specific classification parameters.
There are some additions to the notation described earlier: the N R
matrix of priors for the entries of the projection matrix A is denoted by L.
For these priors, f; g are used as hyper-parameters. The standard
deviations for the hidden representations and classification parameters
are given as h and w, respectively. As short-hand notations, the
hyper-parameters of the model are denoted by =f; ; h; w; g, the

where the predicted outputs fftgT
t=1, similar to the discriminant outputs in
support vector machines, are introduced to make the inference proced-
ures efficient (Albert and Chib, 1993). The non-negative margin param-
eter  is introduced to resolve the scaling ambiguity and to place a low-
density region between two classes, similar to the margin idea in support
vector machines, which is generally used for semi-supervised learning
(Lawrence and Jordan, 2005). ðÞ represents the Kronecker delta func-
tion that returns 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise.

Note that the dimensionality reduction part considers all data points,
whereas the binary classification part considers only the data points with
given labels in each task, leading to the ability of handling missing values.

3.2.1 Inference using variational Bayes To obtain an efficient
inference mechanism, we formulate a deterministic variational approxi-
mation instead of using a Gibbs sampling approach, which is computa-
tionally expensive (Gelfand and Smith, 1990). The variational methods
use a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using an ensemble of

based dimensionality reduction part, we first calculate the kernel matrix
K using the original data matrix X and then find the hidden representa-
tion matrix H by projecting the kernel matrix into a subspace using the
projection matrix A. In the binary classification part, we first calculate the
predicted outputs fftgT
t=1 over the hidden representations using the task-
specific classification parameters fwtgT
t=1 and then map these outputs into

3.3 Baseline algorithms
To show the practical importance of multitask learning, we compare our
method to two baseline algorithms: (i) Bayesian single-task learning and
(ii) kernelized Bayesian single-task learning. The technical details for the
baseline algorithms can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.3.1 Bayesian single-task learning
Instead of learning a unified
model for all tasks conjointly, we can train a separate model for each
task. For this purpose, we use a Bayesian linear classification algorithm,
which is known as ‘probit classifier’ (Albert and Chib, 1993). We call this
algorithm ‘Bayesian probit classifier’ (BPROBIT).

3.3.2 Kernelized Bayesian single-task learning
Instead of training
a linear model, we can also use a kernelized algorithm to obtain non-
linear models. For this purpose, we use a kernelized Bayesian classifica-
tion algorithm, which is known as ‘relevance vector machine’ (Bishop and
Tipping, 2000; Tipping, 2001). We call this algorithm ‘Bayesian relevance
vector machine’ (BRVM).

3.4 Extension to regression problems
Our method and two baseline algorithms are defined for the binary clas-
sification scenario but they can easily be extended to regression problems.
The technical details for the regression variant of our method can be
found in the Supplementary Material. We explain the regression variant
of our method in detail, and the regression variants of baseline algorithms
can also be derived similarly.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed KBMTL method,
we report its results on two datasets and compare it with two
baseline algorithms, namely, BPROBIT and BRVM. We have
three main reasons for these particular choices:
(i) Both
BPROBIT and BRVM use same type of inference mechanism
with our method. (ii) BPROBIT is from the family of linear and
regularized algorithms, which are considered as the standard ap-
proach for drug susceptibility prediction. (iii) We can see the
effect of multitask formulation by comparing our method to

4.1 Experimental setting and performance metrics

For each dataset, data points are split into five subsets of roughly
equal size. Each subset is then used in turn as the test set, and
training is performed on the remaining four subsets. This pro-
cedure is repeated 10 times (i.e. 10 replications of 5-fold cross-
validation) to obtain robust results.

We use ‘area under the receiver operating characteristic curve’
(AUROC) to compare classification results. AUROC is used to
summarize the receiver operating characteristic curve, which is a
curve of true positives as a function of false positives while the
threshold to predict labels changes. Larger AUROC values cor-
respond to better performance.

We use ‘normalized root mean square error’ (NRMSE) to
compare regression results. NRMSE of drug t can be calculated
as

shape and scale hyper-parameters of gamma distributed priors
are set to non-informative values not to impose sparsity on the
model parameters. The number of components in the hidden
representation space is selected as R = 10. For all algorithms,
we perform 200 iterations during variational inference.

To calculate similarity between reverse transcriptase sequences

Table 2 gives the mean and standard deviation of AUROC
values obtained by BPROBIT, BRVM and KBMTL for each
drug over 50 replications as their performance measures. We see
that KBMTL obtains the highest mean AUROC values for seven
of eight HIV-1 drugs by improving the results from 0.5 (3TC) to
2.3% (TDF) compared with the second highest. For FTC,
BPROBIT obtains the highest mean AUROC value, whereas
KBMTL falls behind by 0.3%. We also report the average
AUROC values over drugs in the last row of Table 2. We see
that KBMTL outperforms BPROBIT and BRVM by 2.1 and
1.7%, respectively. Figure 3 compares the performance of

BPROBIT, BRVM and KBMTL for each drug using box-and-
whisker plots. It also compares KBMTL and the best baseline
algorithm for each drug using scatterplots. We clearly see that
KBMTL is superior to BPROBIT and BRVM on all drugs
except FTC. The performance differences obtained by
KBMTL over BPROBIT and BRVM on these seven drugs are
statistically significant according to the paired t-test with
P50.01. The increased performance of KBMTL cannot be
explained by the non-linearity introduced owing to the
Gaussian kernel alone because BRVM also uses the Gaussian
kernel and is able to outperform BPROBIT by only 0.4%. The
main reason of this increased performance is the joint modeling
of drugs with multitask learning.

To illustrate the biological relevance of our method, we ana-
lyze the ability to identify drugs with similar mechanisms of
action based on hierarchical clustering of drugs based on the
task-specific classification parameters inferred by KBMTL.
Supplementary Figure S3 compares the clustering results ob-
tained using KBMTL parameters versus clustering based on
similarity of IC50 ratios. We see that the analogs of Cytidine
(3FC and FTC) are clustered together at the bottom level of
the dendogram using both IC50 ratios and KBMTL parameters
for correlation calculation. However, the other drugs with the
same analog are not clustered together at the bottom level based
on IC50 ratios. If we use the task-specific classification param-
eters fwtg8
t=1 found by KBMTL for correlation calculation,
hierarchical clustering is able to find three clusters: (i) analogs
of Cytidine (3TC and FTC), (ii) analogs of Guanosine (ABC and
ddI) and (iii) analogs of Thymidine (AZT and d4T). These re-
sults show that KBMTL is able to reveal underlying biological
similarities between drugs and to make use of this information to
improve predictive performance.

4.3 Performance comparison on GDSC

On GDSC, we compare four algorithms, namely, BRVM with
the linear kernel (BRVM[L]), BRVM with the Gaussian kernel
(BRVM[G]), KBMTL with the linear kernel (KBMTL[L]) and
KBMTL with the Gaussian kernel (KBMTL[G]), in terms of

KBMTL[L] obtains statistically significantly better results than
BRVM[L] in terms of both per-drug and average performances

valid when we compare KBMTL[G] and BRVM[G]. Table 3

obtains better predictive performance than BRVM[L] on 126
of 138 drugs. On 102 of these 126 drugs, KBMTL[L] is statis-
tically significantly better than BRVM[L] according to the

5 CONCLUSION

In this study, we consider the problem of drug susceptibility
prediction based on pharmacogenomic screens against a panel
of drugs. In contrast to earlier studies, we choose to solve this
problem with a multitask learning formulation by considering
each drug as a distinct task and learning a unified model for

respectively. The box-and-whisker and scatterplots compare the NRMSE values of BRVM (on the x-axis of the scatterplots) and KBMTL (on the
y-axis of the scatterplots) with the same kernel. For comparison, blue: KBMTL is better; red: KBMTL is worse

all tasks conjointly. For this purpose, we propose a novel
Bayesian multitask learning algorithm that combines kernel-
based non-linear dimensionality reduction and binary classifica-
tion to classify data points as resistant or susceptible. We
formulate a deterministic variational approximation inference
scheme, which is more efficient than using a Gibbs sampling
approach in terms of computation time. We then extend our
algorithm to regression to predict real-valued outputs such as
half maximal inhibitory concentration and AUC.

The main novelty of our approach comes from the joint
Bayesian formulation of projecting data points into a shared
subspace and learning predictive models for all drugs in this
subspace, which enables us to capture commonalities between
subsets of drugs to improve predictive performance. The
increased performance is due to elimination of off-target effects
and drug-specific experimental noise that may be present in drug
susceptibility values. Another novelty of our approach comes
from the ability to handle missing drug susceptibility values
owing to experimental conditions and quality control reasons,
which increases the effective sample size, leading to more robust
predictions especially for drugs with a large number of missing
phenotype values.

To demonstrate the performance of our algorithm, called
KBMTL, we perform cross-validation experiments on drug sus-
ceptibility datasets of two major human diseases, namely, HIV
and cancer. For the HIV dataset, we classify viral reverse tran-
scriptase sequences as resistant or susceptible against eight nu-
cleoside analogs using mutation profiles extracted from sequence
information of
the viral genotype. Our multitask learning
method obtains statistically significantly better results on seven
of eight drugs compared with two baseline single-task learning
methods that consider each drug separately. For the cancer data-
set, we predict AUC within the range of experimental screening
concentrations for each cell line against 138 anticancer drugs
using gene expression profiles. Our method with the linear or
Gaussian kernel obtains statistically significantly better results
on 102 or 98 of 138 drugs, respectively, compared to a single-
task learning method with the same kernel function. These re-
sults show that predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of
drugs simultaneously within a multitask learning framework im-
proves overall predictive performance over single-task learning
approaches that learn drug-specific models.

We implement both single-task and multitask learning meth-
ods using efficient variational approximation schemes, where co-
variance calculations are the most time-consuming steps because
of matrix inversions. BRVM has OðN3Þ complexity per iteration,
but we need to train a separate model for each drug, leading to
OðTN3Þ overall complexity. KBMTL learns a unified model for
all drugs conjointly and has OðRN3+NR3+TR3Þ complexity
per iteration, which shows that our algorithm has comparable
computational complexity with single-task learning methods up
to moderate values of R.

We envision several possible extensions of our work in future
pharmacogenomic applications. Based on an analysis over
KBMTL model parameters, we are able to identify groups of
compounds with similar mechanisms of action. As functional
screens are being performed on increasingly large numbers of
compounds or genetic perturbations, often with poorly charac-
terized mechanisms or strong off-target effects, jointly modeling

each compound in the context of the full screening collection
should yield novel
into compound mechanisms.
Moreover, the ability to identify groups of related compounds
with a shared robust molecular predictor should aid drug discov-
ery efforts by improving the interpretability of large screens and
providing multiple lead compounds effecting similar biological
processes. From an algorithmic perspective,
the kernelized
Bayesian framework provides an extensible template for
incorporating prior knowledge. For example, prior information
may be incorporated to encourage similar predictors to be
inferred for compounds known to target proteins in the same
pathway. Importantly, extensions of more complex prior infor-
mation are computationally tractable owing to the highly effi-
cient inference performed by the variational Bayes algorithm. In
summary, we believe that the method presented in this work
contributes to the field of pharmacogenomic analysis by improv-
ing the robustness of drug susceptibility predictions by leveraging
information shared across multiple compounds in a screen, and it
provides an efficient Bayesian inference framework that may be
applied and extended by the community in future applications.
