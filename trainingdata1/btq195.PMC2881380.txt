ABSTRACT
We present a new, ﬁrst-of-its-kind, fully automated computational
tool MOTIF-EM for identifying regions or domains or motifs in cryoEM
maps of large macromolecular assemblies (such as chaperonins,
viruses, etc.) that remain conformationally conserved. As a by-
product, regions in structures that are not conserved are revealed:
this can indicate local molecular ﬂexibility related to biological
activity. MOTIF-EM takes cryoEM volumetric maps as inputs. The
technique used by MOTIF-EM to detect conserved sub-structures
is inspired by a recent breakthrough in 2D object recognition.
The technique works by constructing rotationally invariant,
low-
dimensional representations of local regions in the input cryoEM
maps. Correspondences are established between the reduced
representations (by comparing them using a simple metric) across the
input maps. The correspondences are clustered using hash tables
and graph theory is used to retrieve conserved structural domains
or motifs. MOTIF-EM has been used to extract conserved domains
occurring in large macromolecular assembly maps,
including as
those of viruses P22 and epsilon 15, Ribosome 70S, GroEL, that
remain structurally conserved in different functional states. Our
method can also been used to build atomic models for some maps.
We also used MOTIF-EM to identify the conserved folds shared
among dsDNA bacteriophages HK97, Epsilon 15, and ô29, though
they have low-sequence similarity.

1 INTRODUCTION
The key processes in a cell, the fundamental building block of life,
are carried out or at-least inﬂuenced by large macromolecular
assemblies
chaperonins.
Understanding their structures and interactions is needed for
understanding their mechanisms and hence essential
for a

complete understanding of
level. A major development over the last 15 years has been
the success of cryoEM in the very challenging task of
determining and understanding the structures of LMAs (often
in the molecular mass range 1–100 million Da). CryoEM has
emerged as a method distinctly more suited for determining
and understanding structures of LMAs in under near-native
conditions and inferring conformation ﬂexibility (by capturing
‘snapshots’ of dynamic processes) associated with their working

mechanisms
(Chiu et al., 2006; Jiang and Ludtke, 2005). With
recent automation advances, CryoEM structures of large assemblies
can be obtained at subnanometer resolution within few days of
work (Zhang et al., 2009).

Structural comparison is a critical step in structural biology
in order to derive the
research using cryoEM. For instance,
functional mechanism of a newly determined structure,
is
often compared with structures (for instance, same molecule in
different functional states) already determined and studied by X-ray
crystallography or cryoEM. In this article we present a new fully
automated ﬁrst-of-its-kind computational tool MOTIF-EM, which
is meant to solve an important structural comparison problem P.

it

P is deﬁned as follows: compare a non-atomic resolution structure
(i.e. a cryoEM map from EMDB) with another structure (either
another cryoEM map or a map blurred from a crystal structure)
and identify conserved structural domains or motifs or sub-map (if
there is any) between the pair of input structures. The by-product
of solving P is revelation of the regions in the input pair which
are not-conserved between them. These non-conserved regions can
point to local molecular ﬂexibility related to biological activity,
if the input pair are same molecule in two different functional
states. For instance, two cryoEM maps of ribosome 70S are shown
in Figure 9Aa and b Solving P with these two maps as input
means detecting the location and shape (or domain boundary) of
the two domains: 50S and 30S (shown as yellow and blue regions,
respectively, in Fig. 9Ac and d) that are known to be structurally
conserved between the two maps. The by-product of solving P for
this pair of 70S, is the revelation of the regions which are not-
conserved or ﬂexible between the input structure pair, i.e. the red
regions, as detected by MOTIF-EM, in Figure 9Ac and d. This region
has been implicated with EF-G binding and and tRNA locomotion
(Valle et al., 2003).

Prior to MOTIF-EM, there was no direct and fully automated
way of solving P, without substantial prior knowledge (unavailable
at times)—such as, the occurrence of the common conserved sub-
region in the two input maps as a high-resolution structural homolog
in some domain databank (such as SCOP). See Section 2 for more
details.

Structural comparison tools like MOTIF-EM are useful as
conserved motifs or domains can point to conserved active sites,
indicating function sharing, evolutionary relationships or drug
binding targets for therapies. The remaining non-conserved regions
in the input structure pair, revealed as by-product, can point to
local molecular ﬂexibility related to biological activity. MOTIF-
EM is expected to work with cryoEM maps upto the resolution
when structural domains and assembly components in the maps
remain detectable, which is typically believed to be 15 Å or better

resolution (Lasker et al., 2007). Apart from breaking a map into
conserved and non-conserved regions, we will show that MOTIF-
EM can be used to:

(a) infer conformation changes (Section 4.2.1),
(b) dock atomic-resolution domains (from NMR and X-ray
crystallography based methods) into cryoEM maps (Sections
4.2.2),

(c) propose atomic models for cryoEM maps in some cases

(Section 4.2.2), and

(d) compare maps of proteins with little sequence similarity

(Section 4.2.3).

The technique used by MOTIF-EM to detect conserved sub-
structures is inspired by Lowe (2004)—a recent breakthrough in
2D object recognition.

2 RELATED WORK
The indirect approach in Lasker et al. (2005, 2007) to solve P is to
ﬁrst convert input maps into collections of helices (which requires
manual speciﬁcation of appropriate map density thresholds (Jiang
et al., 2001) that can be found in the input maps, ignoring any other
non-helical information in the input maps. Hence this approach
is not suitable for those cryoEM maps which are predominantly
deﬁned by non-helical entities (such as, beta sheets) or even hardly
detectable helices (like ones that are short or occur in maps coarser
than 10 Å resolution). MOTIF-EM, on the other hand, does not do
any reduction of input maps and works on their full form and is fully
automated (i.e. does not require the user to guess and provide input
parameters). Hence, unlike Lasker et al. (2005, 2007), MOTIF-EM
is applicable to any kind of macromolecular cryoEM map.

Other available methods that could help solve P, but in limited

cases, can be described in two classes:

I ‘Compare and dock’ methods: Methods like (Ceulemans
and Russell, 2004; Jiang et al., 2001; Roseman, 2000;
Rossmann et al., 2001; Topf et al., 2005; Volkmann and
Hanein, 2003) search atomic-resolution domain banks (e.g.
SCOP) for structural homologs of the domains in a given
cryoEM map. Structural homologs, if found, are docked into
appropriate regions of the maps resulting in full or partial
atomic resolution models for the map. Some, like (Tama and
Miyashita, 2004; Wriggers and Birmanns, 2001), also allow
conformational ﬂexibility in the docked homologs.

II De novo methods: These methods (Baker et al., 2007; Yu and
Bajaj, 2007) try to detect long helices and large beta sheets
in maps with sub-nanometer resolution. In the cryoEM maps
with resolution better than 4.5 Å, backbone tracing has also
been achieved (Jiang et al., 2008; Ludtke et al., 2008).

One could use methods from these two classes to construct
the backbone (which can have construction errors), of
the
macromolecular assembly, after which one could use existing
common protein substructure determination methods to solve P.
But this approach has a very limited applicability as constructing
the backbone using the class (I) and (II) methods is not easy in
the ﬁrst place. For instance, class (I) methods assume that isolated
high-resolution structural homologs of different parts of a given
cryoEM are available in some databank, which is often not the case.

i302

Moreover, class (II) methods can only be used in maps which are
predominantly composed of long helices and large sheets and are
in the sub-nanometer resolution range, which is again not common.
Also both (I) and (II) may require signiﬁcant amount of manual
intervention. On the other hand, MOTIF-EM searches for conserved
domains between the input cryoEM maps without depending on the
availability of isolated structural homologs or backbone trace or
even detectable secondary-structure elements in the maps and in a
fully automated way. As indicated earlier, MOTIF-EM can also be
used to compare a cryoEM map with an atomic-resolution structure,
from say X-ray crystallography or NMR-based methods.

3 METHOD: THE ALGORITHM MOTIF-EM
In this section we describe the working mechanism of our new structural
comparison computational tool MOTIF-EM. Its main steps are summarized
in Figure 1A. MOTIF-EM takes as input a pair of cryoEM maps M1, M2. If
one of the inputs is an atomic resolution structure, then it has to be converted
to a simulated cryoEM map using, say, ‘pdb2mrc’ in the EMAN package
(Ludtke et al., 1999).

the direction closest to the re-expressed one. The magnitudes of the stored
gradients in a bin are summed up to obtain a numerical value for each bin
[reﬂected in the length of the directions in (c)].

X,Y ,Z represent directions of larger local density variations. This is achieved
by sampling k points in the neighborhood of po (Figs 1B, S1). Singular value
decomposition (SVD) is done on the density variations of the sampled points
(Figs 1B, S2) to obtain the orientation of O-XYZ (Figs 1B, S3 and S4: X is
the ﬁrst column of U, and so on).

In Step 2 of Figure 1A (also see Fig. 3A), MOTIF-EM ﬁnds a local
region descriptor (LRD), denoted by , for all the grid points in M1 and
M2 (Fig. 1C). For a grid point po, (po) is a rotationally invariant, reduced
representation of the local region around po. Rotational invariance enables
comparison of local regions around a pair of grid points, via respective
’s, directly without worrying about pre-aligning the local regions.  is
essentially a 3D extension of the 2D LRD proposed in Lowe (2004) (referred
to as ‘Keypoint’). Figure 1C describes the construction of ’s. K points {p1,
p2,…, pk} are ﬁrst sampled around po (Figs 1C, S2). Then (po) is essentially
a gradient histogram GH(po) (Fig. 3Ab), representing a coarse discretization
of the [-π, π]× [0, π] direction space, in which the local gradients at the

LRDs, one from each quadrant, can be stacked together as a single vector to

sampled points are distributed. In our implementation a GH has 26 bins (or
representative gradient directions). For a sampled point pi, the local gradient
gi (the ﬁrst axis of the local frame at pi) is ﬁrst re-expressed in the local
frame at po (Figs 1C, S2.1–2) and then put into the GH bin which represents
the direction closest to gi (Figs 1C, S2.4). Re-expressing the gi’s in the local
frame of po makes (po) rotationally invariant (Lowe, 2004). After putting
all gi’s in the bins, for a given bin the magnitudes of the gradients stored in
it are summed up to get a numerical value for that bin (Figs 1C, S2.5). Then
(po) is essentially the numerical values of the bins stacked as a vector. A
more complex LRD (the one actually described in Fig. 1C) is constructed
by dividing the region around po into eight quadrants, constructing a (po)i
for each quadrant, and stacking the (po)i’s together as a vector [(po)1,
(po)2, …, (po)8] (Fig. 3B).

MOTIF-EM uses another step, Step 6 of Figure 1A (also see Fig. 7), to
remove the false positives in C, i.e. those match pairs that do not correspond
to D. For a domain/sub-region D to be rigidly conserved as D1 and D2 in M1
and M2, respectively, inter-point distances in D have to be conserved both in
D1 and D2. To use this property, we construct a graph G, corresponding to
C, such that a node ni in the graph is a match pair mi from M(C). Suppose
the nodes ni and nj correspond to match pairs m(p1
j1, p2
j2),
respectively. An edge occurs between ni and nj, if the distance between the p1

and p1
j2, within a small threshold—let
us call this construction C1. Having deﬁned G like this, MOTIF-EM extracts
large cliques from G using graph methods described in Abu-Khzam et al.
(2005). A clique corresponds to a maximal sub-graph S(G) in G, such that
there is an edge between every pair of nodes in S(G)−−−let us call this
axiom A1. Since the nodes of G corresponds to M(C), S(G) corresponds to
a subset of M(C), which we call SM(C): {mi1, mi2,…}, where mj :(p1
aj, p2
bj).
Hence the match pairs in SM(C) deﬁne a set of grid points S1: {p1
a1, p1
a2, …}
in M1 and a corresponding set of grid points S2: {p2
b2, …} in M2, such that
the inter-point distances are preserved between S1 and S2, i.e. distance[S1(i),
S1(j)]–distance[S2(i), S2(j)]. This follows from the construction C1 and the
axiom A1, just laid. This is partially illustrated in Figure 7. The grid point
sets S1 and S2 are reported as identiﬁed conserved domain/sub-region pair
by MOTIF-EM.

4 RESULTS
Now we report the outcome of applying MOTIF-EM on some
instances of P. MOTIF-EM was run on a 2.33 GHz, 512 CPU cluster,
located at Stanford University (http://biox2.stanford.edu). MOTIF-
EM took upto 60 min on the cluster to generate the outcomes.
The same implementation of MOTIF-EM is available for download
and use at: http://ai.stanford.edu/∼mitul/motifEM. The images of
structures shown were generated using UCSF Chimera package
(Pettersen et al., 2004) from the Resource for Biocomputation,
Visualization and Informatics at
the University of California,
San Francisco (for cryoEM maps, surface representation was used).

4.1 A simulated case
First, in this section, we verify the sanity of MOTIF-EM on a
simulated testcase. We create two synthetic cryoEM maps A and
B. Map A is simulated from an ‘open’ conformation GroEL atomic
coordinates (PDB id: 1oel) containing a domain called ‘equatorial’.
Map B is simulated by arbitrarily placing a part of the same GroEL
equatorial domain in a protein environment [Fig. 8(b1 and b2)].
MOTIF-EM is used to compare A and B and extract the part of
GroEL equatorial domain co-occurring in them. This is done in two
rounds of tests (or two varying conditions).

Testing under varying map resolution: In the ﬁrst round of tests,
four sets of cryoEM map pair A and B are synthesized, evenly
in the resolution range 5–20 Å (Table 1, column 1). The size or
spatial volume occupied by the atomic resolution equatorial domain,
included while generating A and B, was kept constant at v0. MOTIF-
EM is applied to each set of the map pair to extract the part of
equatorial domain co-occurring in them. As seen in Table 1, second
column, in all ﬁve cases, MOTIF-EM successfully determined the
geometric locations of the co-occurring equatorial domain with error
below 1%. The blue regions in Fig. 8(a3/a4 and b3/b4) are the co-
occurring equatorial regions, as detected by MOTIF-EM, in the 10 Å

maps A and B, respectively. Also, the third column in Table 1,

reports the relative size (v/v0× 100) of the equatorial map region

(size or spatial volume: v) co-occurring in maps A and B, retrieved
by MOTIF-EM [i.e. ratio of blue regions in Fig. 8(a3 and a1)]. We
see in Table 1, that the relative size of the extracted conserved region
pair is in the range 93–56%, as the resolution of the map pair is varied
from 5 to 20 Å. The shrinking size of the extracted conserved region
pair is not the inability of MOTIF-EM, but is due to the fact that
more and more structural information is lost, especially near domain
boundary, as the map resolution worsens. As noted in (Lasker et al.,
2007), one expects domains and assembly components less likely to
be detected as the resolution of a cryoEM map approaches 15 Å.

Testing under varying conserved domain size: In the second round
of tests, four sets of cryoEM map pair A and B are synthesized
such that the size or spatial volume occupied by the high-resolution
equatorial domain [blue regions in Fig. 8(a1 and b1)], included

while generating A and B, was reduced from v02= v0 to v02 = 0.25v0

(Table 2, column 1). The resolution of the maps was kept ﬁxed at
10 Å. Again, MOTIF-EM is applied to each set of the map pair. Here
also, as seen in Table 2, second column, in all ﬁve cases, MOTIF-EM
successfully determined the geometric locations of the co-occurring
equatorial domain portion with error below 1%. The 3rd column

in Table 2, reports the relative size (100×v/v02) of the conserved

sub-region (size or spatial volume: v) or the equatorial map region
co-occurring in maps A and B, extracted by MOTIF-EM, for each
set. We see in Table 2, that the size of the extracted conserved
domain pair is reduced from 83 to 45%, as the size v0 of the common
equatorial domain used in the simulated maps is reduced from 100
to 25%. Again this is expected, as noted in (Lasker et al., 2007)—
as the size of a conserved structural regions decreases it becomes

(2003) turned out to be predominantly the 30S and 50S subunits
of 70S ribosome. Valle et al. (2003) also indicates that
the
remnant non-conserved region is likely to be marked by activities
such as EF-G binding and tRNA locomotion. We measured the
relative positions of extracted domains, corresponding to 30S
and 50S subunits,
in the two conformations and veriﬁed the
ratchet like motion reported in Valle et al. (2003). The animation
in http://ai.stanford.edu/∼mitul/motifEM/rna_anim.gif depicts this
ratchet like motion of the two subunits in 70S, upon conformation
change, deduced by MOTIF-EM.

We validate these results from MOTIF-EM in the following

ways:

(a) Visual inspection using markers: Figure 9Ba and b show the
correspondences (numbered red balls) established by MOTIF-
EM between the ﬁrst extracted domain pair. Likewise,
Figure 9Bc and d correspond to the second extracted domain
pair. The correspondences are reasonably located.

Fig. 9C. The remnant un-conserved region in the two input maps shown in
Figure 9Aa and b. This is effectively Figure 9Ac and d, with conserved parts
(yellow and blue regions) deleted. This un-conserved region could either be
an interesting activity site or just noise in the input maps.

(b) Both the extracted domain pairs, when aligned, have high map
density cross-correlation values of 0.92 and 0.91, respectively.
(c) The geometric transformation yielded by MOTIF-EM that
aligns the extracted domain pair has been conﬁrmed by
realigning the extracted domains using FOLDHUNTER
(Jiang et al., 2001) (an existing software to dock a cryoEM
submap into another map).

(d) The plasticity of the remnant map regions [shown as red in
Fig. 9Ac and d] is best justiﬁed by visual inspection. This is
partly evident by looking at Figure 9C.

The detection of the two conserved regions and the remnant
non-conserved region in the two 70S conformations in the work
of Valle et al. (2003) required signiﬁcant manual intervention.

4.2.3 Structural comparsion of maps with little sequence similarity
In this demonstration, we use MOTIF-EM to identify the conserved
shared folds among dsDNA bacteriophages HK97, Epsilon 15 and
Phi 29. The fold similarity between them is also evident by visual
inspection [(a and b) of Fig. 11A and B]. Here, MOTIF-EM is used
to conﬁrm and precisely quantify it. For HK97 an atomic resolution
structure is available (PDB id: hk97). For Epsilon 15 and Phi 29,
cryoEM maps at 4.5 and 7.9 Å, respectively, are available. There
is no evident sequence similarity among HK97, Epsilon 15 and
Phi 29 (Jiang et al., 2008; Morais et al., 2005). In the ﬁrst trial,
a monomer each from HK97 and Epsilon 15 (Fig. 11Aa and b) were
given as input to MOTIF-EM. MOTIF-EM extracted the conserved
fold between the input monomer pair as shown in Figure 11Ae and f
(also the non-red region in Figure 11Ac and d). Sixty percent of
the HK97 backbone is conserved. In the second trial, a monomer
each from HK97 and Phi29 (Fig. 11Ba and b) were given as input to
MOTIF-EM. In this case also, MOTIF-EM extracted the conserved
fold between the input monomer pair as shown in Figure 11Be and f
(also the non-red region in Fig. 11Bc and d). Sixty-four percent of
the HK97 backbone is conserved.

Fig. 10. Model building. The open conformation GroEL cryoEM map and a
closed conformation GroEL high-resolution model (top, left block) were
compared using MOTIF-EM to yield three pairs of conserved domains
(top, right block; images are magniﬁed wrt left block ones). The conserved
domains in the GroEL cryoEM map were replaced with corresponding
conserved domains in the high-resolution model, to yield a high-resolution
model for the GroEL cryoEM map (left, bottom).

(such as SCOP) were searched. Then these homologs were docked
into the cryoEM maps using semi-automated means. However, as
we saw in this section, MOTIF-EM is able to detect the conserved
and non-conserved regions in an automated fashion.

4.2.2 Model building using MOTIF-EM Next we show the
potential of MOTIF-EM to build Cα backbone models for cryoEM
maps in special cases. We demonstrate this by doing model building
for the GroEL cryoEM 6 Å map (Ludtke et al., 2004). The map and
the Cα backbone structure of a closed conformation GroEL ring
(PDB ID: 1aon) were compared using MOTIF-EM (Fig. 10, left, top
block). This yielded the three conserved domain pairs (Fig. 10, right
block), between the two input structures, corresponding to the known
equatorial, intermediate and apical domain demarcations in GroEL.
MOTIF-EM also gives relative geometric rigid body transformation
matrices needed to dock/ﬁt the extracted conserved domains from
the Cα backbone structure into the cryoEM map. Based on these
transformation matrices and the D7 symmetry of the GroEL 6 Å
cryoEM map, a Cα backbone model corresponding to the map was
assembled and is shown in Figure 10 (left bottom).

The assembled model

is in reasonable agreement with a
model obtained by individually docking three pre-demarcated
GroEL domains using SITUS (Wriggers and Birmanns, 2001)
and Chimera’s (Pettersen et al., 2004) model ﬁtting tool (for the
intermediate domain, initial guess was required).

The advantage of MOTIF-EM against any other docking-based
model building software, such as SITUS (Wriggers and Birmanns,
2001), etc., is that one does not have to demarcate the input atomic
structure, i.e. specify domain boundaries (or refer to curated SCOP
domain bank). MOTIF-EM automatically crops out the domains
from the input atomic structure that need to be ﬁtted in the input
map.

[colored as blue in (Bc and Bd)] is shown. Correspondences (numbered
red balls), determined by MOTIF-EM, are shown. (Bg) Alignment of the
conserved (blue cartoon) and non-conserved (red cartoon) parts of HK97, as

These conserved folds extracted from bacteriophages HK97,
Epsilon 15 and Phi 29 conﬁrm the high structural similarity between
the phages, even with no evident sequence similarity between them,
suggesting the possibility of a common ancestor between them
(Jiang et al., 2006; Morais et al., 2005).

We evaluate these results from MOTIF-EM in the following way.
Since the resolution of the Epsilon 15 map is reasonably high, the
evaluation is best done by visual inspection. As seen in Figure 11Ag,
the conserved part (blue cartoon) of HK97, as determined by
MOTIF-EM, is contained very well in the map density of Epsilon
15, while the non-conserved (red cartoon) part usually protrudes
out of the density. This is further supported by ﬁtting scores from
Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004): the conserved part has a ﬁtting
score of 43.1, much higher than 16.7: that of non-conserved part.
We also use markers (numbered red balls in Fig. 11Ae and f) to
show the visually convincing correspondences between the HK97
and Epsilon 15 structures, established by MOTIF-EM. Likewise,
the correspondences between Phi29 and HK97, obtained by MOTIF-
EM, are shown in Fig. 11Be and f. Figure 11Bg shows the alignment
of the conserved (blue cartoon) and non-conserved (red cartoon)
parts of HK97, as determined by MOTIF-EM, with the Phi29 map.
As seen, the conserved part ﬁts the map much better than the non-
conserved parts of HK97. This is also supported by ﬁtting scores

i308

from Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004): the conserved part has a ﬁtting
score of 0.80, much higher than 0.49: that of non-conserved part.

5 CONCLUSION
We have described a new, ﬁrst-of-its kind, computational tool
MOTIF-EM that can identify structural motifs or domains that
are conserved between a pair of cryoEM maps. As a by-product,
regions that are not conserved are also revealed. Such a tool is
useful as conserved structural entities can point to conserved active
sites—indicating common function, evolutionary links and drug
binding targets for therapies. The non-conserved regions, revealed
as by-product, can point to local molecular ﬂexibility related to
biological activity. Apart from breaking an input map pair into
conserved and non-conserved regions, MOTIF-EM can (i) dock
existing atomic-resolution domains into cryo-EM maps, (ii) propose
atomic resolution models for some cryoEM maps, and (iii) compare
maps with conserved structures but little sequence similarity.

The distinct advantage of using MOTIF-EM is that it enables
the users to directly and automatically compare and analyze two
cryoEM structures. Otherwise,
the conventional way has been
indirect comparison, via docked structural homologs or backbone
traced models (both not always available), which can introduce
errors from imperfect docking and modeling into the structural
analysis. Overall, this required signiﬁcant manual intervention.

In the future we would like to do structure comparisons using
MOTIF-EM on a much larger scale. Such as, comparing a given
cryoEM map with all the available structures in various databanks
(such as, EBI cryoEM and PDB databanks) and detecting previously
unknown links between the cryoEM map and all other known
structures.
