ABSTRACT
Motivation: The O-ring theory reveals that the binding hot spot
at a protein interface is surrounded by a ring of residues that are
energetically less important than the residues in the hot spot. As
this ring of residues is served to occlude water molecules from
the hot spot, the O-ring theory is also called ‘water exclusion’
hypothesis. We propose a ‘double water exclusion’ hypothesis to
reﬁne the O-ring theory by assuming the hot spot itself is water-free.
To computationally model a water-free hot spot, we use a biclique
pattern that is deﬁned as two maximal groups of residues from two
chains in a protein complex holding the property that every residue
contacts with all residues in the other group.
Methods and Results: Given a chain pair A and B of a protein
complex from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we calculate the
interatomic distance of all possible pairs of atoms between A and
B. We then represent A and B as a bipartite graph based on these
distance information. Maximal biclique subgraphs are subsequently
identiﬁed from all of the bipartite graphs to locate biclique patterns
at the interfaces. We address two properties of biclique patterns: a
non-redundant occurrence in PDB, and a correspondence with hot
spots when the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of a biclique
pattern in the complex form is small. A total of 1293 biclique patterns
are discovered which have a non-redundant occurrence of at least
ﬁve, and which each have a minimum two and four residues at the
two sides. Through extensive queries to the HotSprint and ASEdb
databases, we veriﬁed that biclique patterns are rich of true hot
residues. Our algorithm and results provide a new way to identify
hot spots by examining proteins’ structural data.

1 INTRODUCTION
Anatomy, characterization and statistical analysis of protein–protein
interfaces have been broadly and extensively studied under the
principles (Chothia and Janin, 1975; Jones and Thornton, 1996)
of protein–protein recognition and interaction. A protein binding
interface composes of two relatively large, spatially close protein
surfaces with good geometric shape and chemical complementarity.

To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The formation of protein chain interfaces is driven by various natural
forces such as van der Waals contacts and electrostatic interactions,
resulting in the removal of water molecules from the binding sites
(Fernandez and Scott, 2003; Privalov et al., 2007). This water-
removal-then-binding has been well characterized by the inﬂuential
‘O’-ring theory (Bogan and Thorn, 1998; Chakrabarti and Janin,
2002; DeLano, 2002b; Moreira et al., 2007; Thorn and Bogan, 2001),
which is also called ‘water exclusion’ hypothesis. It highlights that
the stability of a complex is determined by only a small number of
energetically outstanding residues; it also reveals that these ‘hot-
spot’ residues are usually located at the center of the interface
and surrounded by energetically less important residues that shape
like an O-ring to occlude bulk water molecules from the hot spot.
A lab-veriﬁed example of the O-ring theory was reported in the
pioneering work (Clackson and Wells, 1995) in which alanine-
scanning mutagenesis was used to determine the binding hot spots
between human growth hormones and human growth hormone-
binding proteins. The O-ring theory is profounding. However,
the organizational topology of the ring-inside, energetically more
important hot residues is uncertain and not speciﬁed by the O-ring
theory.

To reﬁne this long-standing theory, we suggest a ‘double water
exclusion’ hypothesis to characterize the topological organization
of residues in a hot spot and their neighboring residues. On one
side, we agree with the O-ring theory that there should exist a ring
of residues surrounding the hot spot for avoiding the invasion of
water molecules after the complex formation; on the other hand,
we suppose that the hot spot itself is water-free. The water-free
assumption may be too strict, so, our another hypothesis is whether
the amount of water molecules inside a hot spot is proportional
to its phylogenetic evolution progression toward to the perfect
water-free binding. In this work, we focus on the investigation of
the ‘double water exclusion’ hypothesis only, while the latter (and
bigger) hypothesis is left as an open question for interested readers
and ourselves in future research.

We propose to use contact residues that are densely interacted
in a compact region to model a hot spot. [Here, a pair of residues
contact to each other if there exists a pair of atoms whose distance
is below the sum of their corresponding van der Waals radii plus the
diameter (2.75 Å) of a water molecule.] We take the classical graph
term ‘biclique’ (Eppstein, 1994) to denote this molecular topology,
and call it ‘biclique pattern’. Formally, a biclique pattern between
two chains in a protein complex consists of two maximal groups of
residues (one from each chain) such that every residue contacts with

all residues in the other group. Thus, if a biclique pattern is observed
from a protein complex, then all possible pairs of the residues from
the two sides are spatially so close that there is no sufﬁcient room
between them to accommodate any water molecule. That is, this is
an interface structure exhibiting a zero-water tolerance property and
forming a collective force of multiple, dense atom-atom pairs. Such a
structure is therefore useful for lowering the local dielectric constant
and enhancing speciﬁc electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions
to strengthen the stability of the binding. On the other hand, by the
maximality requirement of biclique pattern, any neighbor residue
at one side of the pattern disassociates with at least one residue
at the other side. This makes the neighbor residues ﬂexible to
form a fence preventing the biclique pattern residues from solvent
partially or entirely. Thus, if every residue in a biclique pattern has
a small solvent accessible surface area (SASA) in the complex,
then this biclique pattern reﬂects best the spirit of ‘double water
exclusion’—all the inner hot residues are organized as a biclique
without holding any water molecule, while there exist a ring of
residues blocking the solvent accessibility to the hot spot.

Our biclique pattern concept integrates ideas not only from the
O-ring theory, but also from the ‘coupling’ hypothesis (Halperin
et al., 2004) which is another insightful proposition about hot-spot
residues. As said in the O-ring theory, energetically important hot
residues are often clustered, and usually located at the center of
lesser important residues. While, the ‘coupling’ hypothesis bridges
the relation between hot residues from the two sides of an interface,
stating that experimental hot residues tend to couple across a two-
chain interface. Combining these two observations, it can be seen
that the central hot residues of an O-ring structure are ‘coupled and
interacting’across the interface. Our biclique pattern concept exactly
reﬁnes this hybrid idea by specifying that the coupled and interacting
hot residues are a maximal cluster of residues that have a full ‘water
exclusion’ adjacency.

The biclique pattern concept can also be supported by the
inﬂuential work by Keskin et al. (2005), where the organization
of structurally conserved hot-spot residues has been studied. Keskin
et al. (2005) used the term ‘hot region’ to describe assemblies of
hot residues that are located within densely packed regions with
a network of interactions; their analysis over 44 interface clusters
with 568 hot-spot residues shows that 79% of the hot residues were
found to be in the hot regions. By deﬁnition, it can be seen that
the all-versus-all full adjacency required by a biclique pattern is the
most optimal network of interactions for a region having two groups
of residues. Therefore, our biclique pattern concept theoretically
strengthens and signiﬁes the hot region proposition. The maximality
requirement also guarantees that the size of a biclique pattern
is as large as possible, increasing the binding stability as much
as possible. These enhancements and consistency suggest
that
our theoretical top-down ‘biclique’ approach meets the empirical
bottom-up ‘region’ approach at a point where both demonstrate a
spatially well-organized topology of hot-spot residues.

This work is also related to previous studies on contact residues
and binding interfaces. Wolfson, Nussinov and their coworkers
(Halperin et al., 2004; Keskin et al., 2004, 2005; Li et al., 2004;
Mintz et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 1996, 1997) deﬁned a protein
interface as two parts: contact residues and the neighbor residues
of the contact residues. A pair of residues (one from each chain) is
deﬁned as ‘contacting’ across the interface if the distance between
any two atoms of the two residues is less than the sum of their

744

corresponding van der Waals radii plus 0.5 Å; a residue from the
same chain of a contact residue is deﬁned to be a ‘nearby’ residue
of this contact residue if the distance between their two Cα atoms
is <6 Å. This category of deﬁnitions also include several variations
as proposed in Davis and Sali (2005); Gong et al. (2005); Korkin
et al. (2005); Larsen et al. (1998); Lawrence and Colman (1993);
Ofran and Rost (2003); Preissner et al. (1998). The key difference
from these existing work is that we investigate clusters of contact
residues that are densely interacted like a biclique in a compact
region where the compactness is measured by the water exclusion
principle. Besides, we use the small complex SASA constraint to
narrow down the scope of biclique patterns, so that the biclique
patterns have a good correspondence to hot spots, and have the best
spirit of the ‘double water exclusion’ hypothesis.

We address two properties of biclique patterns: (i) their occurrence
and statistical signiﬁcance in the protein data bank (PDB) protein
complexes, and (ii) their relation with veriﬁed hot spots in literature.
The former is an important
indicator to see whether biclique
patterns are statistically occurring in protein–protein interactions
signiﬁcantly; while the latter is an important evaluation way to see
whether our ‘double water exclusion’ truly reﬁnes the O-ring theory.
In our method, we sum up a non-redundant occurrence in the PDB
complexes for every biclique pattern. We also break the sum into
obligate and transient interactions. This distinction is meaningful
because obligate and transient interactions are characterized by
distinct physico-chemical properties (Mintseris and Weng, 2005;
Ofran and Rost, 2003; Sprinzak et al., 2006). Therefore, it is
possible that a biclique pattern occurs in only obligate interactions,
or in only transient interactions, or in both types of interactions.
If a biclique pattern occurs frequently, we calculate its complex
SASA by using the NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993)
software (http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess). For those
with a small SASA, we believe that
they are likely to be a
hot spot.

2 DATA AND METHOD
We downloaded X-ray crystallographic protein structures having resolution
better than 2.5 Å from a March 2008 version of PDB (http://www.rcsb.org).
We considered only PDB entries with two or more polypeptide chains that
each have more than 30 amino acids. In total, we obtained 17 248 PDB
complexes for this study.

It is computationally challenging to efﬁciently identify biclique patterns
due to the maximality constraint and the all-versus-all adjacency. In this
work, we take an efﬁcient approach to the localization of biclique patterns
at every pair of interacting protein chains. Our algorithm consists of three
main computational steps: (i) construction of bipartite graphs based on the
residues’ 3D-coordinate information of interacting chain pairs within protein
complexes, (ii) discovery of maximal bicliques from every bipartite graph
and (iii) calculation of exact non-redundant occurrence for every maximal
biclique that meets a size threshold.

Step 1: a bipartite graph G is a graph whose vertices can be divided into
two disjoint sets V1 and V2 such that no two vertices within V1 or within V2
are adjacent (Asratian et al., 1998). It is usually denoted by G=(V1,V2,E),
where E is the set of edges of G. To transform an interacting chain pair
into a bipartite graph, we represent every residue as a vertex, and an edge
is assigned between a residue x1 in one chain and a residue x2 in the other
chain if and only if there exists a pair of atoms between x1 and x2 whose
distance is less than a threshold. In this study, we set the threshold as the
sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii plus the diameter (2.75 Å) of
a water molecule.

Step 2: for a bipartite graph G=(V1,V2,E) representing a pair of
interacting polypeptide chains, we identify the complete set of maximal
biclique subgraphs from G. A biclique subgraph H of G is a graph consisting
of two sets of vertices X1⊆ V1 and X2⊆ V2 such that every vertex in Xi
is adjacent to all vertices in Xj where j(cid:3)= i. A biclique subgraph H is
maximal in G if there is no other biclique in G that contains H. Observe
that this maximal all-versus-all adjacency emulates the biological ‘water-
exclusion’ hypothesis very well. Maximal biclique subgraphs are identiﬁed
through our earlier Linear time Closed pattern Mining algorithm for Maximal
BiClique subgraphs (LCM-MBC) algorithm (Li et al., 2007). The LCM-
MBC algorithm has two input parameters p and q that can control the
minimum number of vertices in each side of a maximal biclique.

Step 3: we identify bicliques that occur in protein complexes with
a high non-redundant occurrence; while bicliques that occur in only a
few interacting chain pairs are not of our primary interests. By ‘occur’,
we mean that not only all the residues of the biclique are matched, but
also the biclique structure is maintained. In other words, two biclique
patterns, P1=(Y1,Y2,E1) and P2=(Y3,Y4,E2), are considered as the
same if and only if Y1= Y3, Y2= Y4 and E1= E2 (or Y1= Y4, Y2=
Y3 and E1= E2). Assume m number of chain pairs are used, written
as chainPairs={chainPair(i)=(SR(i)

and SR(i)
represent the string of residues for the two chains. Transform

Let BiC be the set of all maximal bicliques in these bipartite graphs
G(i),
its
occurrence is determined as follows. We go through {G(i) | i=1,2,...,m}
to count the number of those containing H(j); if the number exceeds
a pre-deﬁned threshold sup, then H(j)
is a maximal biclique subgraph
that corresponds to a biclique pattern of signiﬁcance. To guarantee a
non-redundant occurrence for H(j), actually, we check whether those
chainPair(i) containing H(j) have a high BLAST similarity to each other.
We remove the redundant chair pairs in the ﬁnal occurrence counting
for H(j). Here, chainPair(a) and chainPair(b) are redundant

Our algorithm is termed as biBonder. Its pseudo code is shown in
Algorithm 1. This algorithm was implemented in Python and our experiments
were conducted in Linux environment with CPU of 2589.845 MHz and RAM
of 31 GB. The program takes ∼0.375 s on average to locate all maximal
bicliques from a pair of interacting protein chains.

Double water exclusion hypothesis

We note that maximal biclique or

its generalized form quasi-
biclique subgraph has recently emerged in bioinformatics studies for
the characterization of protein–protein interactions and their networks
(Li et al., 2006; Morrison et al., 2006; Suryani et al., 2008). Here, we have
explored a novel use of bicliques in structural bioinformatics.

In our method, one important post-processing step is a statistical
evaluation of these biclique patterns and the identiﬁcation of obligate and
transient interactions that contain a given biclique pattern. We use the highly
accurate NOXclass algorithm (Zhu et al., 2006) to differentiate between
obligate and transient interactions, and also distinguish crystal packing.

3 OCCURRENCE AND STATISTICAL

SIGNIFICANCE OF BICLIQUE PATTERNS

There are many examples of hormones that bind multiple receptors,
or receptors that bind multiple hormones (DeLano et al., 2000)
where their ‘consensus’ sites have been shown useful to understand
biological functions. Similarly to those consensus information, the
occurrence information of a biclique pattern in many interacting
protein–protein interfaces is of our interest. This information can be
obtained by using the biBonder algorithm. As shown in its pseudo
code, three parameters are required to specify, namely, the minimum
number of residues in one side of a biclique pattern (i.e. p), the
minimum number of residues in the other side of the biclique pattern
(i.e. q), and the minimum occurrence in the pairs of interacting
protein chains (i.e. sup).
Many choices are available for these parameters. Here, we present
in Table 1 the numbers of biclique patterns when we set p=2, q=4
and sup=5. Column 1 of this table speciﬁes the size of biclique
patterns where ‘x residues’ means that exactly x residues are in
one side of the biclique pattern, and ‘y residues’ means exactly
y residues in the other side; column 2 shows the total number of
biclique patterns in each size category; column 3 the maximum
non-redundant occurrence of the biclique patterns in each category;
columns 4–6 the average (and maximum, minimum) complex SASA
per residue of the residues in each category. In total, we identiﬁed
1293 biclique patterns which have a non-redundant occurrence of at
least ﬁve and which each have a minimum two residues in one side
and minimum four residues at the other side. Most of these biclique
patterns contain uneven numbers of residues at their two sides, in
particular those consisting of only two residues in one side. There
are no biclique patterns whose total number of residues exceeds 10.

high as 3.0× 106, 4.5× 103, 5.2× 103, 3.9× 106, and 1.9× 106,
respectively, in the ﬁve chair pairs 1A8Gab, 1CWQab, 1E0Pab,
6UPJab, and 1HVHab. The signiﬁcance difference is attributed to
the different number n of H
in the 5 chain pairs. If a biclique pattern
occurs in multiple chain pairs in PDB, in this case, we take the
average as the signiﬁcance of this pattern in PDB. We found that:
the 916 biclique patterns of the size ‘2–4’ in Table 1 have an average
signiﬁcance value of 1.38× 107 with the minimum of 33.4 and the
maximum of 2.6× 109; and the 12 biclique patterns of the size ‘4–4’
have an average signiﬁcance value of 3.38× 109 with the minimum
of 153909.3 and maximum of 1.1× 1010.

4 BICLIQUE PATTERNS ARE RICH OF HOTSPOT

RESIDUES

A hot spot was deﬁned as a cluster of residues that are energetically
important
in protein complex formation (Clackson and Wells,
1995). A hot spot typically constitutes only a small subset of
interfacial residues that are buried in the middle of the interface.
As hot spots contribute most to the binding afﬁnity and strength of
protein interactions, understanding hotspot residues is a fundamental
problem in molecular biology [see two surveys DeLano (2002b);
Moreira et al. (2007)]. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Clackson and
Wells, 1995) is a widely used experimental method to determine
whether a residue is in a hot spot. A residue is in a hot spot
if its free energy of binding is signiﬁcantly changed (G≥
2 kcal/mol) upon the mutation to alanine. ASEdb [Alanine Scanning
Energetics database (Thorn and Bogan, 2001)] is a searchable
database containing hotspot residues that have been veriﬁed by
the experiment of alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Although this is
a small database due to experimental difﬁculties (very slow and
labor-intensive), the data quality is high.

To evaluate our hypothesis, we make queries ﬁrst to the ASEdb
database to test whether our biclique pattern residues are hotspot
residues, and then to the HotSprint (Guney et al., 2008) database
which is the latest database storing computational hot spots.

The ASEdb database contains 28 protein complexes. However,
only 13 of them are matched with PDB entries: 1a4y, 1ahw, 1brs,
1bxi, 1cbw, 1dan, 1dvf, 1gc1, 1jck, 1vfb, 2ptc, 2hfm and 3hhr. The
other 15 protein complexes’ structure information is not available
from PDB, or not well matched (two of them). This pre-processing
result is consistent with a literature work (Gao et al., 2004). In
these 13 protein complexes, 439 alanine-mutated residues have been

Fig. 1. A biclique pattern identiﬁed in the PDB protein complex 1A8G that
also occurs in other four PDB complexes. Dotted lines between two residues
indicate that their distance in 3D space is not larger than the sum of their
corresponding van der Waals radii plus the diameter of a water molecule.

We describe in detail an example of biclique pattern using
Figure 1. This biclique pattern has a non-reduntant occurrence of
four in obligate interactions, and a non-redundant occurrence of
one in transient interactions. Speciﬁcally, this pattern occurs in the
interaction between chain A of PDB 1A8G at Leu5-Pro9-Leu24-
Thr26-Leu97, and chain B at Thr26-Leu97. See the left panel of
Figure 1, where a dotted line represents that the distance between
some two atoms of the two residues is not larger than the sum
of their corresponding van der Waals radii plus the diameter of a
water molecule; the right panel of this ﬁgure shows a virtual graph
representation of this biclique pattern used in our computational
algorithm. One interesting observation is that the residues can be
far away in sequence, but they are close to each other in 3D space,
exhibiting a full ‘water exclusion’ adjacency.

This pattern also occurs in the obligate interactions between
chain A and B of 1CWQ, between chain A and B of 1E0P
and between chain A and B of 6UPJ; and in the transient
interaction between chain A and B of PDB 1HVH. Note that
these ﬁve protein complexes are diverse: 1A8G is about ‘HIV-
1 protease in complex with SDZ283-910’; 1CWQ is about ‘M
intermediate structure of
the wild type Bacteriorhodopsin in
combination with the ground state structure’; 1E0P is about
‘L intermediate of Bacteriorhodopsin’; 6UPJ is about ‘HIV-2
protease/U99294 complex’; while 1HVH is about ‘non-peptide
cyclic Cyanoguanidines as HIV protease inhibitors’. By our
deﬁnition and algorithm, the geometric arrangement of the residues
and the shape of the bicliques are similar across the ﬁve chain
pairs. We also found that
the global sequence positions and
the relative positions between the constituent residues of this
biclique are different from one PDB entry to another as detailed
below:

The larger G the residues are, more likely those are in our biclique patterns.

tested, including 268 residues whose G <0.5, 89 residues whose
G is between 0.5 and 1.5 kcal/mol (called warm residues),
30 residues whose G is between 1.5 and 2.0 kcal/mol (called
very warm residues) and 52 residues whose G≥2 kcal/mol
(called hot residues). Our biclique patterns contain a total of 576
residues that are identiﬁed from the same 13 protein complexes by
using Algorithm 1, under the setting p= q=2, sup=1 and SASA
threshold is 36%. (We note that under this setting the biclique
residues constitute around 10% of the total residues in a chain pair
on average over the 13 protein complexes.)

Of the 52 hot residues of ASEdb, 94.2% of them (49) are also our
biclique residues; of the 30 very warm residues of ASEdb, 80% of
them (24) are also our biclique residues; of the 89 warm residues
of ASEdb, 64% of them (57) are covered by our biclique residues;
and of the 268 residues whose G <0.5, 31.7% of them (85) are
contained in our biclique residues. Therefore, we can note that lab-
veriﬁed hot residues are almost all (49 out of 52) contained in our
biclique patterns; thus we can conjecture that almost all hot residues
of ASEdb satisfy the property of double water exclusion. When
residues are energetically becoming less important from the range
very warm to warm and to the range G <0.5, their likelihood to
be contained in our biclique patterns becomes smaller and smaller
from 80 to 64% and to 31.7. Therefore, we can also conjecture
that our biclique patterns are less likely to contain energetically less
important residues. Table 2 details the break down of this result for
the 13 protein complexes.

We are unable to determine the accuracy of our biclique residues
that are also true hot residues, as there are 361 out of our 576
biclique residues that have not been tested by the alanine-scanning
mutagenesis—the 361 biclique residues may be or may not be true
hot residues. However, we have at least veriﬁed based on ASEdb
that if a residue is a hot residue, then it can be covered by our
biclique pattern. That means, double water exclusion is a necessary
condition for a true hot residue. However, our biclique patterns also

Double water exclusion hypothesis

contain some energetically less important residues. This leaves us
room to reﬁne the hypothesis of double water exclusion again to
further narrow down biclique patterns so that those energetically
less important biclique residues can be ﬁltered.
If the total 268 residues (G <0.5) are taken as a negative
set, the speciﬁcity of our method is 1−85/268=68.3%; if the
total 133 residues (G≤0) are taken as a negative set, then
thus the speciﬁcity
our biclique residues contain 41 of them,
of our method is 1−41/133=69.1%. These results indicate that
our biclique residues did not entirely exclude energetically less
important residues. However, we would like to note that
the
double water exclusion hypothesis and biclique patterns are still
biologically acceptable. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis, the main
biotechnology adapted in ASEdb, examines the binding free energy
change of a single residue upon its mutation to alanine. This
experimental method does not solve the cooperativity and additivity
problems of energetically important residues. Recently, alanine-
shaving technologies (Moreira et al., 2007) have been proposed.
Alanine shaving is a process of making multiple simultaneous
alanine mutations, thus cooperativity and additivity can be measured
by comparing the simultaneous free-energy change to the sum of
the free-energy changes attributed to single mutations. Therefore,
some single mutations that are less important under alanine-scanning
mutagenesis can be energetically important under alanine shaving.
Thus, some energetically less important single mutants can be
considered as an integral part of a hot spot. We would also like
to note that as the ‘double water exclusion’ mechanism underlines
our biclique patterns, residues in a biclique pattern (especially the
one having high occurrence and with multiple residues in each
side) are therefore excellent candidate residues for the simultaneous
shaving.

HotSprint (Guney et al., 2008) is a database storing computational
hot spots for 35 776 protein interfaces among 49 512 protein
interfaces extracted from the multi-chain structures in PDB (as of
February 2006). Those computational hot spots were derived based
on residues’ conservation score, propensity, and SASA, and they are
highly correlated with the experimental hot spots with a sensitivity
of 76%. HotSprint is a very new database which does not provide
automatic query service yet over large number of PDB entries.
Therefore, we report our manual query search results and present
examples to illustrate the ‘double water exclusion’ mechanism that
reﬁnes the ‘O’-ring theory.

We continue to use the simple example of biclique pattern
described in Figure 1 which is detected from PDB 1a8g, consisting of
ﬁve residues (Leu5-Pro9-Leu24-Thr26-Leu97) from chain A (total
99 residues), and two residues (Thr26-Leu97) from chain B (total
99 residues). According to the HotSprint database (by the default
setting), only Leu5 was not in the hot spot, the other six residues
are all hot residues. The conservation score (Keskin et al., 2004),
monomer SASA, and complex SASA for these seven residues are
listed in Table 3.

We can see from this table that these seven residues are all buried
in the complex with a very small SASA ranging from 0.0 to 2.63 Å2.
Therefore, this compact cluster of residues is almost entirely not
accessible to solvent, namely, there exists a ring of neighbor residues
constructing a shelter to prevent the hot residues from the water
molecules. This is the necessary condition for a residue to become
a hot residue (Bogan and Thorn, 1998; DeLano, 2002b) by the
O-ring theory. The neighbor residues from 1a8g chain A are Pro1,

Gln2, Ile3, Thr4, Asp25, Gly27, Cys95, Thr96 and Asn98. Their
conservation score, monomer SASA and complex SASA are shown
at Table 4. These neighbor residues (except Cys95) all have a
large complex SASA, implying that, together with the neighbor
residues from chain B, they indeed form a residue wall to prevent
the central biclique pattern from any water molecule. This is a nice
picture showing an O-ring structure with a ‘double water exclusion’
mechanism: the central biclique residues form a compact water-free
hot spot, while the neighboring residues form an O-ring to occlude
any solvent accessibility.

This nice picture is depicted in Figure 2 which was plotted by
the PyMOL software (DeLano, 2002a). A lock-and-key architecture
can be clearly observed in the left panel: the ﬁve hot residues from
chain A form the lock (or groove), while the two hot residues from
chain B act as a key. This is in agreement with the mechanism of
‘anchoring residues’ in protein–protein interactions (Rajamani et al.,
2004), which explains the kinetically low structural rearrangement
of the residues during the formation of complex.

As mentioned, this biclique pattern also occurs between chain
A of PDB 1CWQ at LEU92-LEU93-LEU94-THR89-PRO91 and
chain B at THR90-LEU93. (1CWQ has 248 residues in each of its
two chains.) Though this protein complex is quite different from
the 1A8G complex in both structure and sequence, the shape of this
biclique pattern is very similar in these two protein complexes as
expected. See Figure 3 and compare it to Figure 2.

residues—LEU92-LEU93-LEU94-THR89-PRO91—in chain A, and two hot
residues—THR90-LEU93—in chain B (best viewed in color).

We manually searched HotSprint and found that all or almost all
residues of this biclique pattern are hot residues in 1CWQ, 1E0P
and 6UPJ; and also in many redundant obligate PDB entries such as
1bdq, 1kzk, 1lzq, 1rl8, 1sgu, 1sh9, 1sp5, 1u8g 1w5v, 1w5w, 1w5x,
1w5y, 1wbk, 1wbm, 1xl2, 1xl5, 1ytg, 1yth, 1ztz 2bqv, etc.

Our second example of biclique pattern is a highly frequent
pattern, occurring non-redundantly in 12 chain pairs. Interestingly,
all these interactions are obligate; also, the average complex SASAs
per residue of this pattern in these chain pairs are all small ∼2–3
Å2. Table 5 shows the protein complex chain pairs that contain this
biclique pattern. According to the available results provided by the
HotSprint database, almost all the residues of this biclique pattern
in these 12 chain pairs are hotspot residues.

These protein chair pairs are all about the study of photosynthetic
reaction center, though they have <90% BLAST similarity to each
other. For example, the H chains between 1DXR and 1OGV have a
similarity score of only 39%, while their L chains have a similarity
score of only 56%. (Refer to Section 2 for the BLAST software.) The
amazing result here is that this biclique pattern occurs exactly in the
same position across 11 chain pairs (2–12 of Table 5) despite of their
structural difference. Furthermore, the last eight protein complexes
of Table 5 have been previously investigated by Koepke et al. (2007);

all of them are X-ray structure of the Photosynthetic Reaction Center
from Rhodobacter Sphaeroides under neutral or charge separated
states of different PH levels. The amino acids of these protein chains
are the same, but their secondary structure and domain assignment
are different under different PH conditions. We can conjecture that
these different charge states and pH levels do not change the hot
spot at LYS8, TYR9 and VAL11 of chain L, binding with GLY110,
LEU87, PRO111 and VAL109 of chain H.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have proposed a ‘double water exclusion’hypothesis to reﬁne the
inﬂuential O-ring theory for the study of hot spots at protein binding
interfaces. We take the classical graph term ‘maximal biclique’ to
model the molecular topology of contact residues tightly packed
in close vicinity between a pair of interacting protein chains. We
term this molecular topology as ‘biclique pattern’ to emphasize the
collective force of the multiple, dense atom-atom pairs. Based on
PDB structural data, we have addressed two properties of biclique
patterns: the non-redundant occurrence and statistical signiﬁcance
of biclique patterns, and the relation with computational and
experimental hotspot residues. We have observed that biclique
patterns can have very high occurrence in both obligate and transient
interactions. This indicates that the biclique topology commonly
exists in interacting residues, and they are not random patterns
as evaluated by their statistical signiﬁcance. We have veriﬁed that
many biclique residues are hotspot residues through queries to the
HotSprint and ASEdb databases when the complex SASA of the
residues is small. This result supports our ‘double water exclusion’
mechanism; and this result also strongly suggests that the inﬂuential
‘O’-ring theory, the ‘coupling’ tendency, together with our biclique
pattern concept can provide a road map to deeply understand the
binding afﬁnity of protein interactions.
