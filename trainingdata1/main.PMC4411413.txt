Abstract Ovary development is a complex process involving numerous genes. A well-developed
ovary is essential for females to keep fertility and reproduce offspring. In order to gain a better
insight into the molecular mechanisms related to the process of mammalian ovary development,
we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis on ovaries isolated from infant and adult mice
by using next-generation sequencing technology (SOLiD). We identiﬁed 15,454 and 16,646 trans-
criptionally active genes at the infant and adult stage, respectively. Among these genes, we also
identiﬁed 7021 differentially expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that, in general, the adult ovary
has a higher level of transcriptomic activity. However, it appears that genes related to primordial
follicle development, such as those encoding Figla and Nobox, are more active in the infant ovary,
whereas expression of genes vital for follicle development, such as Gdf9, Bmp4 and Bmp15, is upreg-
ulated in the adult. These data suggest a dynamic shift in gene expression during ovary development
and it is apparent that these changes function to facilitate follicle maturation, when additional func-
tional gene studies are considered. Furthermore, our investigation has also revealed several impor-
tant functional pathways, such as apoptosis, MAPK and steroid biosynthesis, that appear to be
much more active in the adult ovary compared to those of the infant. These ﬁndings will provide
a solid foundation for future studies on ovary development in mice and other mammals and help
to expand our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events that occur during
postnatal ovary development.

ovary development, oocytes are induced to differentiate into
somatic ovarian cells, whereas germ cells are dispensable in
the development of testis [1]. At birth, all oocytes are either
‘naked’ or only have a few surrounding granulosa cells. Subse-
quently, the accretion of somatic cells surrounding the oocytes
forms primordial follicles, which preserve the primordial pool.
Later, these primordial follicles are recruited and grow to
mature preovulatory follicles
called
folliculogenesis. This process is initially controlled by local
intercellular signaling events, but later, it responds to the hypo-
thalamic–pituitary axis that regulates selective ovulation.

through a process

Folliculogenesis has been described as a two-phase process:
the initial recruitment of the follicle from the primordial pool
to preantral follicle and the cyclic recruitment of the growing
follicles,
involving gonadotropin-dependent stages of rapid
growth, during which a preantral follicle will develop into a
mature preovulatory follicle. Many of the genes that are
directly involved in mouse folliculogenesis have been identi-
ﬁed. For instance, Figla, Wnt4 and TrkB are essential for pri-
mordial follicle formation, whereas Foxo3, Gdf9 and Bmp15
are required for follicle recruitment and growth [2].

Previous transcriptomic surveys of follicle development and
ovary formation have focused on a limited number of genes.
More recently, microarray studies using whole ovaries from
young and old mice have revealed a number of genes that
are differentially expressed depending on the age of the female
mouse and the developmental phase of the follicles and oocytes
[3,4]. For example, in a microarray study of 15,000 genes
expressed in the ovary, the expression level of 2000 of these
genes was found to be signiﬁcantly different between newborn
and adult mice [5]. In another study, 307 genes were found to
be differentially expressed in the ovary during day 2 through
day 4 of postnatal development [6]. However, microarray tech-
nology has several limitations. For instance, microarrays are
devised based on a number of known genes and have limited
power in detecting alternatively spliced genes.

Recently, RNA-seq, which is based on the next generation
sequencing technology, has been shown to have advantages in
both sensitivity and cost [7]. This technique has been used to
survey the transcriptomes of soybean, rice, mice and human
tissues [8–10]. To provide basic transcriptomic data for postna-
tal ovary development, we used RNA-seq to deeply sequence
the transcriptomes of infant and adult mouse ovaries. Further-
more, using this data, we have performed a comprehensive
analysis of the transcriptome dynamics occurring during this
period that may serve as a gene expression proﬁle for ovary
development. By identifying the differentially-expressed genes
(DEGs), we have also provided a blueprint for further investi-
gation of the intricate and potentially subtle changes in gene
expression and function that occur during postnatal ovary
development from one to eight weeks of age.

Results and discussion

Global analysis of gene expression

To obtain a broad, unbiased evaluation of the transcriptomic
dynamic occurring during postnatal development of the mouse
ovary, we performed the ribo-minus RNA-sequencing (rm-
RNAseq) using the ABI SOLiD system to obtain gene
transcription proﬁles for both infant and adult ovary tissues

at single-nucleotide resolution. We obtained 23,866,480 and
26,446,960 mapped reads (50 bp in length) for the infant and
adult ovary, respectively (Table 1). For the adult library,
17,476,893 reads (66.1% of the total mapped reads for adult)
were uniquely mapped to the mouse genomic loci, among
which, 29.3%, 39% and 27.6% were distributed in exons,
introns and intergenic regions, respectively. In addition, we
generated 12,585,638 uniquely-mapped reads (52.7%) from
the infant library, 15.8% in exons, 40.4% in introns and
40.3% in intergenic regions.

One of the primary aims of RNA sequencing is to compare
the gene expression levels between samples. The adult ovary
usually contains more developing follicles and is much more
active than the infant ovary [11]. Therefore, we speculate that
the transcriptional activity of the adult ovary should be higher
than that of the infant ovary. To test this, we used two param-
eters to estimate the holistic transcriptional activity at both
developmental stages: the total number of genes expressed at
each stage and the sum of the reads per kilobase transcript
per million reads (RPKM) values for all of the expressed genes
at each stage. Firstly, we estimated the number of genes
expressed in the infant and adult ovary. To minimize the num-
ber of false positives, we consider a given gene as expressed if
at least two reads were uniquely mapped to the exonic region
of the gene. Using this threshold, we identiﬁed 15,454 and
16,646 genes expressed in the infant and adult ovary, respec-
tively, indicating that more genes are transcribed in the adult
than in the infant. Altogether, we detected a total of 17,102
genes expressed in the mouse ovary at one or both develop-
mental stages. While there was a large overlap in gene tran-
scription between the infant and adult ovaries, there were
also a substantial number of genes that were uniquely
expressed at a particular stage. Expression of 456 genes was
only detected in the infant ovary, whereas 1648 genes were
only expressed in the adult ovary (Figure 1A). Secondly, we
calculated the RPKM values for each expressed gene and
summed them to get the holistic transcriptomic activity at each
stage. The summed RPKM values for infant and adult ovaries
are 51,719 and 92,684, respectively. Gene distribution analysis
further showed that there were more genes expressed at low
levels in the infant ovary compared to the adult ovary, while
more highly expressed genes were present in the adult ovary
compared to the infant ovary (Figure 1B). Therefore, this glo-
bal analysis of gene expression validated our hypothesis that
the transcriptional activity of the adult ovary is much higher
than that of the infant ovary.

Upon further scrutinization of the highly-expressed genes
(RPKM P 20), we found that an appreciable number of genes
(229 genes) were highly expressed at both stages. However,
more genes were highly expressed in the adult only (459 in
adult only vs. 64 in the infant only) (Figure 1C). For example,
Nr5a1, Sox4 and Inhba were uniquely expressed at high levels
in the adult ovary, while Zp3, Col5a1 and Maz were highly
expressed in the infant ovary. Among the top 10 most highly
expressed genes at the infant and the adult stages, 5 genes
are common between the two stages. These include Bat1a
encoding ATP-dependent RNA helicase UAP56/SUB2, Nd1
encoding NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1, Gnb2l1
encoding guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-
like 1, Cox1 encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and Inha
encoding inhibin alpha chain precursor. The high expression
level of Nd1 and Cox1 at both stages indicates the great need

of cell proliferation and growth in ovary development. Mean-
while, the appearance of Inha in the top 10 most expressed
genes at both stages suggests an important role for hormone-
regulated metabolic processes during ovary development.
Several genes with unknown function in the mouse were also
among the top 10 expressed genes, such as 2700023E23Rik
and 1810032O08Rik (RIKEN cDNA database) in the infant,
and 4921521F21Rik in the adult, suggesting their potential
involvement during ovary development. The identity and func-
tion of these unknown genes require further studies.

Analysis of differentially-expressed genes

We applied Fisher’s Exact Test on the read count of each gene
in the infant and adult to acquire statistical support for the sig-
niﬁcant expression differences between the two stages. We used
the DEGseq package to perform this statistical analysis [12].
With the signiﬁcance level of P < 0.001, we obtained 7021
DEGs, including 5862 upregulated genes and 1159 downregu-
lated genes (adult vs. infant). Many of these DEGs are known
to be essential for ovary development, such as Nobox, Figla,
Gdf9 and Zp3. It was striking that 46 genes showed signiﬁcant
changes in expression level but did not have any functional
annotation in Ensembl. Detailed information on all the DEGs
is listed in Table S1.

Further inspection of the DEG distribution in the mouse
genome revealed that number of DEGs correlated well with
the gene density in a speciﬁc chromosome. Thus, more DEGs
were mapped on a chromosome if more expressed genes were
present on the chromosome (Figure 2). We also found that
the highest number of the DEGs were originated from chro-
mosome 11 (569 genes), which is followed by chromosome 2,
7, 4 and 9, respectively (Figure 2). It has also been reported
that abnormalities in the X chromosome, the only idiochromo-
some in females, caused by mutations in X-linked genes are the
leading identiﬁable cause of premature ovarian failure [13].
Our data indicate that 237 X-linked genes were differentially
expressed during ovary development, consisting of 209
upregulated genes and 28 downregulated genes in the adult
compared to the infant.

DEGs were predicted to be important for the speciﬁc
developmental stage of the mouse ovary [5]. To gain a better
understanding of the biological
implications of the DEGs
during ovary development, we performed a standard Gene

Ontology (GO) classiﬁcation. As a result, the 7021 DEGs were
categorized in three basic functional groups: molecular func-
tion, biological process and cellular component groups. The
top six functional categories among the three groups included
cell part, cell binding, cellular process, organelle, metabolic
process and biological regulation (Figure 3). Furthermore, we
performed a functional enrichment analysis using WebGstalt2
to determine the enriched functional groups in the up- and
downregulated genes, respectively [14]. Using all of the genes
in Ensembl as a reference and setting a threshold cut-off value
of P 6 0.001, our GO enrichment analysis suggested extensive
functional differences. The downregulated genes reﬂected a
vast repertoire of genes involved in regulating nuclear activity
and chromatin assembly during morphogenesis in the infant
ovary, while the upregulated genes were related to growth
and metabolic processes (Table S2). This ﬁnding agrees with
the physiological characteristics of the two developmental
stages studied here. In the infant, all oocyte nuclei are arrested
at dictyate and most of the follicles are dormant in the primor-
dial follicle pool; hence, it is not surprising that genes related to
nuclear activity and chromatin assembly are more active at this
stage. In contrast, the follicles start to develop into mature
follicles in the adult, thus requiring the upregulation of genes
associated with growth processes and metabolism.

Analysis of alternatively spliced variants

A large number of mammalian genes have been shown to have
alternatively spliced transcripts [15], which cannot be speciﬁ-
cally detected in microarray experiments. A study using
RNA-seq technology to examine 15 different types of tissues,
found that 90% of all human genes are alternatively spliced
[16]. Thus, using this technology, we can detect speciﬁc splice
variants via the reads mapped to exon(s) or exon combina-
tion(s) that are unique to a transcript. These unique reads
for a transcript can be used as markers and allow us to com-
pare the splice variants between two samples. According to
Ensembl annotation (version 55), 8886 genes have multiple
alternatively spliced transcripts. In our analysis, we detected
alternatively spliced transcripts for 4484 and 5320 genes in
the infant and adult ovary, respectively. It is evident that genes
tended to have more alternatively spliced transcripts in the
adult stage, Moreover, our data also indicate that there are
considerable splicing variations between 2 developmental
stages of the same tissue. These data suggest that alternative
splicing is developmentally regulated in the ovary and
increases the transcript diversity throughout development.
This ﬁnding is very similar to that found for the maize
leaf transcriptome using ultra high-throughput sequencing
technology [17].

Furthermore, we sought to determine whether our RNA-
seq assay could detect novel splice isoforms simply by mapping
the unique reads to the junction database built in house. To
construct the junction database, we generated all possible com-
binations of exon-exon junctions as 98-bp sequences with 49
bases from each exon. After mapping, we selected the reads
only mapped to novel exon-exon junctions. We found that
5394 and 11,139 reads were mapped to junctions distinct from
their known placements (deﬁned by Ensembl annotation) at
the infant and adult stages, respectively. In the infant, there
were 1313 new junctions with at least 2 mapped reads for

242

Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 239–248

906 genes. Meanwhile, 2977 new junctions with at least 2
mapped reads were found for 2,025 genes in the adult. In total,
we determined unreported splicing forms of 2437 genes during
these two developmental stages, with 494 genes supported by
the datasets of both stages. Among this list were genes that
play essential roles during ovary development, such as Foxo3,
Cyp11a1, Zfpm2, Amhr2, Sf1, Esr1, Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1, Col4a1
and Dicer1.

Expression of genes regulating hormone process genes

One of the two key functions of the ovary is the secretion of
steroid hormones that prepare the reproductive tract for fertil-
ization and the establishment of pregnancy. Thus, genes
related to steroid secretion and hormone metabolism play
important roles during ovary development. Based on our
DEG analysis, we found that hormone biosynthesis was
greatly activated in the adult ovary. Among the genes associ-
ated with steroid hormone biosynthesis, expression of 18 genes
was upregulated in the adult ovary compared to the infant
ovary. Moreover, none of these genes were signiﬁcantly higher
expressed in the infant ovary. In particular, expression of some
genes essential for estrone biosynthesis, such as Cyp19a1,
Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1 and Hsd17b1, was signiﬁcantly
upregulated in the adult (Figure S1). In addition, we also
noticed signiﬁcantly-upregulated expression of Fshr, Esr1,
Esr2 and Lhcgr in the adult ovary, which encode receptors
for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estrone and luteinizing
hormone (LH), respectively (Figure 4). FSH, LH and estrone,
along with their receptors, play important roles during follicu-
logenesis [18,19]. The upregulated expression of genes involved
in hormone processing and genes encoding their receptors are
likely essential for fertility in the adult mouse.

Expression of genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway

least

express at

The MAPK signaling pathway is a basic cellular signal trans-
duction cascade that couples intracellular responses to the
binding of growth factors to cell surface receptors and is
known to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival and
differentiation [20,21]. Mammals
four
distinctly-regulated groups of MAPKs: extracellular signal-
related kinases (Erk)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (Jnk1/
2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and Erk5, all
of which are activated by speciﬁc MAPK kinases: Mek1/2
(for Erk1/2), Mkk3/6 (for the p38), Mkk4/7 (also known as
Jnkk1/2; for the JNKs) and Mek5 (for Erk5). It has been
reported that expression of MAPK3/1 (ERK1/2) in ovarian
granulosa cells is critical for female fertility as it regulates
LH-induced oocyte resumption during meiosis, ovulation
and luteinization [22]. Notably, Erk1 and Erk2 are co-
expressed in all mammalian tissues and have been implicated
as key regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation as
well as oocyte maturation in culture [23,24]. Loss of Erk1
causes minimal changes in fertility and embryo viability [25],
while mutation of the Erk2 gene is embryonic lethal in mutant
mice [26]. Our data in the current study showed that the
MAPK signaling pathway is much more active in the adult
ovary, as many of the genes in this pathway had higher
expression levels at the adult stage compared to the infant
stage (Figure S2). Furthermore, the upregulation of Egfr

anti-apoptosis. In summary, genes annotated to participate
in cell apoptosis had substantial alterations in expression
between the infant and adult stages of development, suggest-
ing the essential role of apoptosis during ovary maturation.

Detection of apoptosis-related genes

Detection of transcription factors

Apoptosis is known to be involved in oogenesis, folliculogen-
esis, oocyte loss/selection and atresia; however, its exact role
in ovary development has not been fully characterized [27].
In our study, 42 genes known to be involved in apoptotic
processes had signiﬁcantly altered expression levels, most of
which were upregulated in the adult stage (Figure S3). This
observation suggests that cellular apoptosis was activated in
the adult ovary, resulting in more developing follicles being
degraded through apoptotic processes at this stage. Among
the genes related to apoptosis, we noted that the genes
encoding caspases, the main effector molecules in ovarian
apoptosis, were only modestly expressed in the infant ovary
and their expression increased in variable degrees in the adult
ovary. The signiﬁcant upregulation of Caspase1, Caspase3,
Caspase6, Caspase8 and Caspase9 would be expected to
greatly activate apoptosis [28]. In addition, members of the
Bcl gene family,
including Bcl2, Bax, Bok, Bcl2l1, Bcl2l2
and Bad, were all modestly expressed in the infant and adult
stages, although expression of some genes including Bad and
Bok was slightly upregulated in the adult. However, expres-
sion of Mcl1, another Bcl member known as an anti-apopto-
tic survival factor [29], was greatly upregulated in the adult
tissue, although modest
in the infant ovary. Meanwhile,
expression of some apoptotic inhibitors was also signiﬁcantly
upregulated in the adult. For instance, Xiap which encodes
the most potent caspase inhibitor, was only modestly
expressed in the infant ovary, but was signiﬁcantly upregu-
lated in the adult ovary. Expression of XIAP in the ovary
was upregulated in response to FSH to suppress granulose
cell apoptosis and facilitate FSH-induced follicular growth
[30]. Our results suggest
its role in follicle survival and

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that control gene
expression by binding to speciﬁc DNA sequences, thereby
controlling gene transcription through the recruitment or dis-
missal of RNA polymerase and/or other regulatory proteins.
There have been 1728 genes identiﬁed to encode various TFs
in the mouse genome [31]. Our RNA-seq data indicate that
at least 1462 genes present in the infant ovary encode TFs,
while 1478 TF genes were found in the adult stage, and totally
1515 unique TF genes in this organ (Figure S4). Among these,
16 and 46 genes were highly expressed (RPKM P 20) in the
infant and adult stages, respectively. Interestingly, among the
100 most expressed TF genes in the infant and adult ovary,
59 genes were commonly found at both stages,
including
Sox4, Foxj1 and Ddb1. The consistently high expression of
these TFs during ovary development may indicate their vital
roles in the maintenance of female fertility. On the other hand,
732 TF genes were differentially expressed between the infant
and adult stages, with 632 genes upregulated at the adult stage.
TFs that are related to early ovarian follicular development
often were downregulated from the infant to the adult, includ-
ing Figla [32,33], Nobox [34] and Pou5f1 [35]. Figla is a basic
helix-loop-helix
expressed
exclusively in oocytes and regulates the transcription of zona
pellucida (ZP) genes. A recent comprehensive gene expression
study in Figla null mice showed that some genes essential for
folliculogenesis were downregulated following loss of this gene
[36], indicating that Figla is a key TF in oocyte-speciﬁc gene
expression and is indispensable for not only ZP protein synthe-
sis but also for germ cell assembly. Our observation that Figla
was signiﬁcantly downregulated in the adult is consistent with

transcription factor

some TF genes known to be involved in the later stage of fol-
licle growth were upregulated in the adult, including Foxo1
[37], Foxl2 [38], Smad2 [39] and Gata4 [40]. All the TF gene
expression proﬁles are listed in Table S3.

Expression of TGF-b superfamily genes

The TGF-b superfamily is a structurally-conserved but func-
tionally-diverse group of proteins with at least 35 members
in vertebrates. These proteins are widely distributed through-
out the body and function as extracellular ligands in numerous
physiological processes during both pre-and postnatal life [41].
On the basis of
structural characteristics, members of
this superfamily have been further categorized into several

subfamilies. These include the prototypic TGF-b subfamily,
an extensive bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) subfamily,
the growth and differentiation factor (GDF) subfamily, the
activin/inhibin subfamily (including activins A, AB and B as
well as inhibins A and B), the glial cell-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) subfamily (including GDNF, artemin and
neurturin), as well as several additional members such as
anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and nodal [42]. Many mem-
bers of TGF-b superfamily are expressed by ovarian somatic
cells and oocytes in a developmental stage-related manner
and function as intraovarian regulators of folliculogenesis.

Our results indicate that 28 TGF-b genes were expressed in
the infant ovary and 30 were expressed in the adult ovary
(Table S4). Consistent with a signiﬁcant increase in the number
of developing follicles during ovary development, we found

folliculogenesis, fertilization and pre-implantation develop-
ment [48]. In the last decade, many genes have been identiﬁed
as oocyte-speciﬁc based on large-scale high-throughput
transcriptome data [49–51]. Here, we have listed the expression
proﬁles of the oocyte-speciﬁc genes in infant and adult ovaries
(Figure 5). The expression patterns of these oocyte-speciﬁc
genes showed that most of them were more active during the
infant stage than in the adult stage.

The ZP is mainly composed of three glycoproteins (ZP1–3),
and functions as an extracellular matrix surrounding the ovar-
ian oocyte and ovulated egg that plays important roles during
the fertilization process, including acrosome reaction induc-
tion, polyspermy prevention and embryo protection [52]. As
described previously, Figla regulates the transcription of ZP
genes, and in this study, the expression pattern of Zp1 and
Zp3 coincided with that of Figla, being drastically downregu-
lated in the adult stage compared to the infant stage. However,
Zp2 expression was slightly upregulated. In addition to the ZP
genes, some other key oocyte-speciﬁc genes were also downreg-
ulated in the adult ovary. For example, Nobox, Sohlh1, Gja4,
and Pou5f1 were all signiﬁcantly downregulated at the adult
stage. Nobox (newborn ovary homeobox gene) is necessary
for the expression of several key folliculogenesis genes, includ-
ing Gdf9 and Pou5f1 [53,54]. Gja4 is present in gap junctions
between oocyte and granulosa cells, and Gja4-deﬁcient mice
lack mature follicles, fail to ovulate and develop numerous
inappropriate corpora lutea [55,56]. Sohlh1 (spermatogenesis-
and oogenesis-speciﬁc bHLH transcription factor 1) is another
germ cell-speciﬁc gene that encodes a bHLH protein. Sohlh1
lies upstream of Lhx8, Zp1 and Zp3, and is preferentially
expressed in primordial oocytes [57]. In addition to numerous
downregulated oocyte-speciﬁc genes, we also found that some
important oocyte-speciﬁc genes showed little to no change dur-
ing ovary development. For example, the expression of Oosp1,
H1foo, Lhx8 and Sohlh2 remained relatively constant between
the infant and adult ovaries, suggesting that they have con-
served roles during ovary development. Sohlh2 is preferentially
expressed in germ cells of the embryonic ovary, the oocytes of
primordial and the primary follicles [58]. A recent study of
Sohlh2-deﬁcient mice showed that adult females lacking this
gene are infertile owing to the misexpression of many
oocyte-speciﬁc genes, including Figla, Nobox, Zp1, Zp3 and
Oosp1 [59].

Although many oocyte-speciﬁc genes were downregulated
or unchanged, some had higher expression in the adult stage
compared to the infant stage, including Kit, Kitl, Nlrp14 and
Bmp15. KIT ligand has been reported to be present in oocytes
at all stages of folliculogenesis and functions in the transition
from primordial to primary follicles [60]. On the other hand,
Nlrp14 is a leucine-rich repeat protein and a member of the
NACHT nucleoside triphosphatase family [61], although its
exact function during ovary development is still unknown.

Conclusion

Figure 4 Expression proﬁles of hormone receptor genes in adult
and infant ovaries
Signiﬁcant differences
in expression of genes encoding for
hormone receptors between the infant (black bar) and adult (gray
bar) stages were indicated with *(P < 0.001). The P values were
calculated using Fisher’s exact test (P = 2.18E 25 for Fshr,

that a majority of the differentially-expressed TGF-b genes
and their receptor genes were substantially upregulated in
the adult ovary compared to the infant ovary. Expression of
GDFs and BMPs are known to be involved in follicular devel-
opment. Among the Gdfs detected, Gdf9 and Gdf11 were
upregulated, while Gdf7 and Gdf10 were downregulated in
the adult. Many reports have suggested that Gdf9 plays an
essential role in the stimulation of granulose cell proliferation
and folliculogenesis [43,44]. Furthermore, follicle development
in the ovaries of Gdf9 null mice is arrested at the primary stage
[43], indicating that upregulation of Gdf9 in the adult ovary is
quite important for adult mouse fertility. In regard to the BMP
subfamily, Bmp15, Bmp3 and Bmp2 were signiﬁcantly upregu-
lated from the infant to the adult stage, which was consistent
with their reported roles as positive paracrine factors in follicle
progression [45]. However, Bmp7 and Bmp1 were slightly
downregulated from infant to adult, suggesting that they
may have unknown roles during the early stage of ovary devel-
opment. Intriguingly, the Amh gene, known to negatively reg-
ulate preantral follicle development [46], was also upregulated
in the adult even though there are more developing follicles in
the adult ovary [11]. Upregulation of the Amh gene in the adult
ovary may keep the limited primordial follicles silent due to its
inhibitory actions on primordial follicle assembly [47].

Expression of oocyte-speciﬁc genes

As a specialized cell population, oocytes have been intensively
studied to unravel their unique physiology, from the speciﬁca-
tion of primordial oocytes to the fateful reunion of gametes
during fertilization. Elucidating the alterations in oocyte-
speciﬁc gene expression is essential
to understand the
unique features of oocytes. It has been reported that gene
products expressed solely in oocytes play important roles in

In the present study, the gene expression in infant ovaries and
adult ovaries has been investigated at the transcriptome level
using RNA-seq. We have provided basic gene expression pro-
ﬁles of mouse ovary development. Comparative analysis
showed that the adult ovary has a more active transcriptome
than that in the infant,
in terms of the number of genes

Figure 5 Expression proﬁles of oocyte-speciﬁc genes in adult and infant ovaries
Signiﬁcant differences in expression of oocyte-speciﬁc genes between the infant (black bar) and adult (gray bar) stages were indicated with

expressed, the level of gene expression and the number of
alternatively spliced transcripts. The expression proﬁles also
suggest vital roles for a large number of regulatory genes in
both early and late ovary development, and provide strong evi-
dence for a highly dynamic transcriptome during mouse ovary
maturation. Notably, GO analysis reveals that some important
functional pathways, including apoptosis, MAPK, as well as
steroid and hormone biosynthesis, are more active in adult
ovaries than in the infant. Further studies with these differen-
tially-expressed genes identiﬁed in the present study will extend
our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular
events occurring during the ovary development process and
help illuminate the metabolism, growth and differentiation of
the mammalian ovary.

Materials and methods

Female clean-class Balb/c mice aged 1 week (n = 40) and
8 weeks (n = 15) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory
Animal Technology (Beijing, China). Mice were sacriﬁced by
cervical dislocation. Then all the ovaries of the respective stage
were dissected and pooled together before stored in liquid
nitrogen prior to use. Adult mice were at the proestrus stage
of menstruation at the time of sacriﬁce. The animal experi-
ments in this study were approved by the Animal Care and
Welfare Committee of the Beijing Institute of Genomics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences.

RNA-seq library generation and sequencing

Total RNA from each sample was isolated using TRIzol. The
RiboM-minus Eukaryote Kit (Invitrogen; Catlog No 10837-
08) was then used to deplete the rRNA from the total RNA,
which following this procedure, was designated as ribo-minus
RNA (rm-RNA). We used 1 lg rm-RNA as the starting mate-
rial to construct our RNA-seq library using the SOLiDä
Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit (Applied Biosystems; PN
4425680) as instructed by the manufacturer. Finally, a fraction

of the library, in a size range of 100–200 bp, was selected for
SOLiD sequencing. Emulsion PCR and SOLiD sequencing
were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for
the SOLiDä System. The 50-bp sequences were obtained on
a 1/4 SOLiD v3 slide for each library.

Read mapping

After ﬁltering out the low-quality reads (average quality value
<8), we used the Applied Biosystems software (Corona_
lite_v4.0r2.0; http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/corona/)
to map the remaining 50-bp reads from the infant and adult
ovaries to the mouse reference genome (release on July 09,
2007). We also constructed an exon–exon junction database
according to Ensembl gene annotation (version 55). To be
speciﬁc, for a gene with multiple exons, we used the last 49
nucleotides of one exon as a donor sequence and the ﬁrst 49
nucleotides of each following exon as an acceptor sequence.
We joined the donor sequence and the acceptor sequence into
one exon–exon sequence. All the exon-exon sequences generated
composed our exon–exon junction database. First, we mapped
the full-length 50-bp tags to the reference genome; second, we
analyzed the ﬂow-through against our junction database; third,
we repeated the ﬁrst and the second steps for the ﬁrst 45-, 40-,
35-, 30-, 25-bp truncated tags (after removal of
the tag
sequences beyond each length). For each length, we used 5-,
5-, 4-, 3-, 3- and 2-bp mismatch options in both the genome
and junction mapping steps. Reads mapped to unique positions
in the reference sequence were counted according to their map-
ping location. Then, we calculated the reads number for each
Ensembl gene (version 55) based on the mapping information.

Measurement of gene expression

The uniquely-mapped reads were categorized into four groups
according to their locations in genome: exonic region, intronic
region, intergenic region and junction region. For each gene,
we counted the number of unique reads that were located in
exonic regions to obtain a raw digital gene expression count.

Pan L et al / Transcriptomic Proﬁling of Mouse Ovary Development

247

Genes with at least two uniquely-mapped raw reads in the
exonic region were considered as being expressed in the tissue.
The genes with raw digital gene expression counts greater than
this threshold were then normalized using a slight variation of
the RPKM method [62]. The RPKM for each gene was calcu-
lated with the equation: RPKM ¼ 109C
NL , where C is the number
of uniquely-mapped reads in the merged exonic region, N is the
total number of uniquely-mapped reads in the library and L is
the length of all exons for one gene. Based on the RPLM val-
ues, genes were classiﬁed as lowly-expressed (RPKM < 1),
moderately-expressed (1 6 RPKM 6 20) or highly-expressed
(RPKM > 20), respectively.
