ABSTRACT
Motivation: Phospholipid scramblases (PLSCRs) constitute a family
of cytoplasmic membrane-associated proteins that were identiﬁed
based upon their capacity to mediate a Ca2+-dependent bidirectional
movement of phospholipids across membrane bilayers, thereby
collapsing the normally asymmetric distribution of such lipids in cell
membranes. The exact function and mechanism(s) of these proteins
nevertheless remains obscure: data from several laboratories now
suggest that in addition to their putative role in mediating transbilayer
ﬂip/ﬂop of membrane lipids, the PLSCRs may also function to
regulate diverse processes including signaling, apoptosis, cell
proliferation and transcription. A major impediment to deducing the
molecular details underlying the seemingly disparate biology of these
proteins is the current absence of any representative molecular
structures to provide guidance to the experimental investigation of
their function.
Results: Here, we show that the enigmatic PLSCR family of proteins
is directly related to another family of cellular proteins with a known
structure. The Arabidopsis protein At5g01750 from the DUF567
family was solved by X-ray crystallography and provides the ﬁrst
structural model
the
presumed C-terminal transmembrane helix is buried within the core
of the PLSCR structure, suggesting that palmitoylation may represent
the principal membrane anchorage for these proteins. The fold of
the PLSCR family is also shared by Tubby-like proteins. A search
of the PDB with the HHpred server suggests a common evolutionary
ancestry. Common functional features also suggest that tubby and
PLSCR share a functional origin as membrane tethered transcription
factors with capacity to modulate phosphoinositide-based signaling.

1 INTRODUCTION
Biological membranes have an asymmetric distribution of lipids.
A variety of proteins have been identiﬁed which create and maintain
this distribution. Phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) proteins were
initially identiﬁed as being able to mediate the collapse of this

asymmetric distribution, by accelerating transbilayer movement
of membrane phospholipids in response to elevated [Ca2+
]. This
activity was ﬁrst puriﬁed in the human PLSCR1 protein (Zhou
et al., 1997), named PLSCR1 for phospholipid scramblase 1.
Subsequently, further members of the gene family have been
identiﬁed in the human genome (Wiedmer et al., 2000). More
recently members of this family have been shown to have a role
in cellular signaling. When palmitoylated, PLSCR1 was shown
to be raft-associated, to physically interact with ligand-activated
EGF receptors, and to serve as an adapter to promote interaction
between c-Src, Shc and the EGFR receptor kinase, thus serving
to enhance receptor transactivation (Sun et al., 2002). In rat,
PLSCR1 has been shown to be involved in mast cell activation
through a Lyn-dependent pathway (Amir-Moazami et al., 2008)
with PLSCR2 possibly playing an antagonistic role in mast cell
activation (Hernandez-Hansen et al., 2005). It has also been shown
that PLSCR1 when not palmitoylated is avidly imported into the
nucleus by the importin-α/β nuclear chaperones, where it functions
as a DNA-binding protein with transcriptional activity (Ben-Efraim
et al., 2004). One identiﬁed gene target of nuclear PLSCR1 is the
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 gene (IP3R1), nuclear
PLSCR1 serving to increase both IP3R1 transcription and protein
expression (Zhou et al., 2005).

Mouse knockouts of each of PLSCR1 and PLSCR3 have been
studied. Deletion of PLSCR1 affects myelopoiesis in response
to G-CSF, causing a defect in emergency granulopoiesis (Zhou
et al., 2002). In contrast, deletion of PLSCR3 in mouse gives
rise to abnormal triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation in white
fat, with subsequent manifestations of the metabolic syndrome
(Wiedmer et al., 2004). Deletion of PLSCR orthologues in
Drosophila was found to cause abnormality in ﬂight that was
apparently related to a defect
in motor neurons affecting the
distribution and size of neutransmitter storage vesicles at the synapse
(Acharya et al., 2006). PLSCR3 and other members of the PLSCR
family have also been reported to be mitochondrial proteins, and
proposed to mediate both lipid transport and pro-apoptotic functions
(Liu et al., 2003a, b; Van et al., 2007).

The seemingly disparate and enigmatic biology that has been
observed for the PLSCR family of proteins has to date precluded the

to gain insight

development of a logically consistent molecular model for how these
highly conserved and presumably related proteins might collectively
function in the cell. In addition to the disparity of molecular
interactions and biologic functions that have been ascribed to the
PLSCR proteins, a unifying concept of the functional properties of
the PLSCR family has also been hindered by the absence of any
solved or predicted molecular structure for its members, precluding
an attempt
into protein function from protein
structure. Whereas site-directed mutagenesis has revealed selected
residues that are either targets of post-translational modiﬁcation
(thiolesteriﬁcation and phosphorylation), or that are required to
observe PLSCR1 binding to lipid, proteins or DNA,
there is
virtually no information as to how the functional domains might
be organized, or how their 3D structure might be related to other
proteins with deﬁned function. In order to gain new insight into
the potential structure of the PLSCR protein family, we undertook
extensive similarity searches to identify structural homologues for
the phospholipid scramblase family.

2 METHODS
Proﬁle–proﬁle comparisons were carried out using the Pfam database of
protein families (release 23). The proﬁle for the Scramblase family (accession
PF03803) was compared with the 10 339 other family proﬁles using the
SCOOP software (Bateman and Finn, 2007) and the PRC software using
default parameters. The remote homology detection server HHpred (Soding,
2005) was used to search for homologs of human PLSCR1 in the Protein
Data Bank with default parameters. An alignment of human PLSCR1 with
the DUF567 family member At5g01750 from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB-
code: 1zxu) was generated with HHpred (Soding, 2005) using its maximum
accuracy (MAC) alignment algorithm (Soding et al., 2005) and adjusted
manually. Structural models were built with the Modeller software (Sali
and Blundell, 1993) with default parameters. Loops were modeled with the
MODloop server (Fiser and Sali, 2003). Verify3d (Luthy et al., 1992) was
used to check the model quality.

3 RESULTS
Proﬁle–proﬁle comparisons provide a powerful way to link
homologous protein families. Using the Pfam database of protein
families we were able to scan for similarities of the Scramblase
family to over 10 000 other protein families. A potential relationship
of the Pfam Scramblase family to the uncharacterized Pfam protein
family DUF567 was initially identiﬁed with the SCOOP software
(Bateman and Finn, 2007) with a score of 47.7. The next highest
scoring match was DUF512 with a score of 15.3 which is not
considered signiﬁcant. In addition the PRC (Proﬁle Comparer)
software identiﬁed the relationship between the same two Pfam
families with an E-value of 0.0267. The next highest scoring match
was to the RdRP_2 family (PF00978) with a non-signiﬁcant E-value
of 2.39. We also removed the N-terminal proline-rich stretch of
70 amino acids from human PLSCR1 and searched through the
Protein Database with the HHpred server (Soding et al., 2005).
The ﬁrst match was to At5g01750 (PDB-code: 1zxu), a member
of the DUF567 family from A.thaliana. At E-value 2e-11 and
probability for homology of 99.5% this result is strongly indicative
of a homologous relationship. The second match was again to
1zxu, but with a different alignment, indicating the presence of
internal sequence symmetry (E-value 0.04, 95%). The third hit was

160

to Tubby-related protein 1 (PDB: 2ﬁm_A), with E-value 14 and
probability for homology of 42%.

The DUF567 family, deﬁned by the Pfam database (Finn et al.,
2008), contains only uncharacterized proteins. It is found in plants,
fungi, eubacteria and some archaea. Within the plants DUF567
is greatly expanded, with A.thaliana containing 21 members of
the family. Despite being functionally uncharacterized, the family
has had a representative structure solved by the CESG structural
genomic project (http://www.uwstructuralgenomics.org/) for the
Arabidopsis protein At5g01750 (UniProt:Q9LZX1) (PDB-code:
1zxu). Although no function is known for this protein, taking its
sequence and PSI-BLAST searching (Altschul et al., 1997) it against
the NR database at NCBI with default E-values we ﬁnd that by
round four several members of the Scramblase family are identiﬁed,
including PLSCR1, PLSCR3 and PLSCR5. This conﬁrms that the
scramblase family is related to the DUF567 family and therefore
identiﬁes a structural template for modeling of the scramblases.
An alignment of representatives of the scramblases to the DUF567
family is shown in Figure 1.

The structure of At5g01750, and therefore by similarity the
Scramblase family, is a 12-stranded β-barrel that encloses a central
C-terminal α-helix, see Figure 2. This C-terminal helix is thought
to be a transmembrane helix. However, the structural model suggests
that the hydrophobic nature of this helix is due to its packing in the
core of the protein domain and that this is not a transmembrane helix.
It can be seen that most of the sequence conservation lies within the
secondary structures as well as the β-hairpin turns between strands
2–3 and 4–5 providing further support for the model.

The structural model allows an improved understanding of
previous results. For example, the DNA-binding motif deﬁned by
deletion experiments (Zhou et al., 2005) was identiﬁed as spanning
residues 86–118 in human PLSCR1. This deletion would have
removed the ﬁrst β-strand of the domain potentially leading to
misfolding of the β-barrel with observed loss of DNA binding. Thus,
it remains unresolved whether the observed results from truncation
mutation identify the actual DNA-binding residues in PLSCR1,
or, cause misfolding of the DNA-binding motif. Also it has been
hypothesized that PLSCR contains an EF-hand like Ca2+
-binding
motif (D273–D284), and mutation of select residues within that
motif were observed to abrogate both Ca2+
binding to PLSCR1
and the expression of its Ca2+
-dependent PL scramblase activity
(Zhou et al., 1998). The proposed motif overlaps with one of the
core β-strands of the β-barrel and thus is structurally incompatible
with an EF-hand structure.

As well as providing a structural model for the scramblases,
the structure of At5g01750 shows the same fold as found in the
C-terminal domain of the Tubby protein (Boggon et al., 1999).
A possible homologous relationship between the tubby-like proteins
and phospholipid scramblases is indicated by the fact that a tubby
family protein (PDB-code: 2ﬁmA) appears as second best match in
a database search of PLSCR1 through the PDB using HHpred, albeit
with marginal statistical signiﬁcance. The tubby family of proteins is
only found in eukaryotic species, whereas the scramblase/DUF567
family are found in eukaryotes and eubacteria, which suggests
that the scramblases have a more ancient evolutionary origin. We
hypothesize that the tubby family of proteins evolved from an
ancestral scramblase-like protein. The scramblase structure appears
to have fewer elaborations between the β-strands compared with the
tubby family, which also suggests their more basic ancestral nature.

each family were aligned with the multiple alignment program PROMALS (Pei and Grishin, 2007). The scramblase and DUF567 sequences were aligned
with each other using HHpred (Soding, 2005) in local MAC alignment mode (Soding et al., 2005), while keeping the family alignments frozen. The resulting
alignment was merged with the alignment of tubby-like proteins by using the structural alignment of 1zxu and 1c8z from TMalign (Zhang et al., 2005) as a
guide and again keeping sub-alignments frozen. Red boxes represent regions that are part of the structural alignment. Alignment columns for which scramblase
and tubby family members exhibit similar amino acids are colored according to the chemical nature of the residue class. Various sequence features of the
PLSCR1 sequence are indicated by colored, bold letters: transcriptional activation domain (magenta), Cysteine palmitoylation motif (orange), non-classical

If scramblases and tubby proteins are distantly related, we might
expect to ﬁnd some common functional features. There are a number
of interesting similarities between the two families of proteins
that support an evolutionary connection. First, most members of

the scramblase and tubby family possess an N-terminal stretch of
100–250 natively unfolded residues that might function as activation
domains or protein–protein interaction domains. Both scramblases
and tubby are localized to the inner side of the cell membrane,

in the case of scramblases by palmitoylation and in the case of
Tubby by phosphoinositol binding. In both cases these localizations
appear to be reversible and disruption of the membrane binding
gives rise to a nuclear localization. Members of each family have
been shown to be DNA binding (Boggon et al., 1999; Zhou
et al., 2005), although no speciﬁc target has yet been identiﬁed
for Tubby. Figure 1 shows two positions that conserve positively
charged residues between the scramblases and tubby proteins, one
between strands 3 and 4 and one at the end of strand 11. These
two positions are both at the same end of the barrel and might
form part of a DNA-binding site. One of the binding targets
of PLSCR1 is the promoter of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
receptor. It is notable that calcium release mediated by inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate is part of the signaling cascades mediated by
this protein. Furthermore, it has been shown that Tubby can bind
to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We tentatively suggest
that scramblase genes may also share inositol polyphosphate-
binding activity. It is also possible that tubby proteins may possess
scramblase activity.

4 CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a structural model for the
family of scramblase proteins and have identiﬁed an evolutionary
link with the tubby-like proteins. The members of this new
superfamily are both endofacial plasma membrane and nuclear
distributed, with distinct plasma membrane and nuclear functions.
Nuclear trafﬁcking of these proteins requires liberation from
membrane attachment and import by nuclear chaperones, and results
in binding to chromatin and altered gene transcription. In addition to
common structural ancestory, the possibility of conserved function
as modiﬁers of polyphosphoinositide-based cell signaling is also
suggested.
