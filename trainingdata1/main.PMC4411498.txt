Introduction

Abstract The completion of the Human Genome Project lays a foundation for systematically
studying the human genome from evolutionary history to precision medicine against diseases.
With the explosive growth of biological data, there is an increasing number of biological databases
that have been developed in aid of human-related research. Here we present a collection of human-
related biological databases and provide a mini-review by classifying them into different categories
according to their data types. As human-related databases continue to grow not only in count but
also in volume, challenges are ahead in big data storage, processing, exchange and curation.

As biological data accumulate at larger scales and increase at
exponential paces, thanks principally to higher-throughput
and lower-cost DNA sequencing technologies, the number of
biological databases that have been developed to manage such
data deluge is growing at ever-faster rates. The major objec-
tives of biological databases are not only to store, organize
and share data in a structured and searchable manner with
the aim to facilitate data retrieval and visualization for
humans, but also to provide web application programming
interfaces (APIs) for computers to exchange and integrate data

from various database resources in an automated manner.
Therefore, developing databases to deal with gigantic volumes
of biological data is a fundamentally essential task in bioinfor-
matics. To be short, biological databases integrate enormous
amounts of omics data,
serving as crucially important
resources and becoming increasingly indispensable for scien-
tists from wet-lab biologists to in silico bioinformaticians.

According to a report of 2014 Molecular Biology Database
Collection in the journal Nucleic Acids Research, there are a
sum of 1552 databases that are publicly accessible online [1].
It should be noted, however, that such count of publicly
accessible databases is conservative. In fact, there are some
databases providing online services without publication in
peer-reviewed journal (e.g., The RNA Modiﬁcation Database
at http://mods.rna.albany.edu) or being developed by commer-
cial companies (e.g., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis at http://
www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa), making
them under-
represented in the scientiﬁc community. Considering the con-
tinuously proliferating number of biological databases,
it
becomes increasingly daunting and time-consuming to navi-
gate in the huge volume of databases of
interest. The

completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 holds sig-
niﬁcant beneﬁts for many ﬁelds from human evolution to per-
sonalized healthcare and precision medicine. In this report, we
present a collection of biological databases relevant to human
research and provide a mini-review by classifying them into
different categories.

Database classiﬁcation

Biological databases are developed for diverse purposes,
encompass various types of data at heterogeneous coverage
and are curated at different levels with different methods, so
that there are accordingly several different criteria applicable
to database classiﬁcation.

Scope of data coverage

According to the scope of data coverage, biological databases
can be classiﬁed as comprehensive and specialized databases.
Comprehensive databases cover different types of data from
numerous species and typical examples are GenBank [2],
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) [3], and
DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) [4]. These three databases
were established as the International Nucleotide Sequence
Database Collaboration in 1988 to collect and disseminate
DNA and RNA sequences. On the other hand, specialized
databases contain speciﬁc types of data or data from speciﬁc
organisms. For example, WormBase [5] is for nematode biol-
ogy and genomics and RiceWiki [6] is for community curation
of rice genes.

Level of biocuration

According to level of data curation, biological databases can
roughly fall into primary and secondary or derivative data-
bases. Primary databases contain raw data as archival reposi-
tory such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) [7],
whereas secondary or derivative databases contain curated
information as added value, e.g., NCBI RefSeq [8].

Method of biocuration

As a consequence of the explosive growth of data, curation
increasingly requires collective intelligence for collaborative
data integration and annotation. Therefore, biological data-
bases can also be classiﬁed as (1) expert-curated databases,
e.g., RefSeq [8] and TAIR, [9] and (2) community-curated
databases, which are curated in a collective and collaborative
manner by a number of researchers, e.g., LncRNAWiki [10]
and GeneWiki [11].

Type of data managed

According to the types of data managed in different databases,
biological databases can roughly fall into the following cate-
gories: (1) DNA, (2) RNA, (3) protein, (4) expression, (5) path-
way, (6) disease, (7) nomenclature, (8) literature, and (9)
standard and ontology.

Human-related databases

Decoding the human genome bears great signiﬁcance in, from a
theoretical view, unveiling human evolutionary history, and
from an application view, exploring personalized medicine
against diverse diseases. Considering the heterogeneity in data
type, scope and curation, biological databases can be classiﬁed
into multiple categories under different criteria as presented
above, making it easier for people to effectively characterize
databases and identify the database(s) of interest. However,
some databases are inaccessible over time or poorly main-
tained/updated or even never used [12]. In this study, therefore,
we assemble a collection of human-related databases that are
widely used and currently accessible via the Internet (Table 1).
As database classiﬁcation based on data type is informative
and straightforward, we assign one major category to each data-
base, albeit one database may correspond to multiple categories.
In what follows, we focus on databases categorized in DNA,
RNA, protein, expression, pathway and disease, respectively.

DNA databases

A DNA database centers on managing DNA data from many
or some speciﬁc species. The primary function of human DNA
databases includes establishment of the reference genome (e.g.,
NCBI RefSeq [8]), proﬁling of human genetic variation (e.g.,
dbSNP [13]), association of genotype with phenotype (e.g.,
EGA [14]), and identiﬁcation of human microbiome metagen-
omes (e.g., IMG/HMP [15]). A representative example of
DNA database is GenBank [2], a collection of all publicly-
available DNA sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gen-
bank). Since its inception in 1982, GenBank grows at an extra-
ordinary pace and as of December 2014, contains over 184
billion nucleotide bases in more than 179 million sequences
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics).

RNA databases

It is well acknowledged that only a tiny proportion of the
human genome is transcribed into mRNAs, whereas the vast
majority of the genome is transcribed into ‘‘dark matter’’––
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that do not encode proteins
[16], including microRNAs (miRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs
(snoRNAs), piwiRNAs
(piRNAs), and long non-coding
RNA (lncRNA). Therefore, an increasing number of human
RNA databases have been built for deciphering ncRNAs
(e.g., GENCODE [17]), in particular lncRNAs that attract
the rising interest (e.g., LncRNAWiki [10]), and characterizing
their functions and interactions (e.g., RNAcentral
[18]). A
representative example of RNA database is RNAcentral [18].
It provides uniﬁed access to the ncRNA sequence data supplied
by multiple databases including Rfam [19], lncRNAdb [20], and
miRBase [21] (http://rnacentral.org).

Protein databases

The purpose of constructing protein databases includes collec-
tion of universal proteins (e.g., UniProt [22]), identiﬁcation of

Note: *This collection, however, by no means pictures the whole range of human-related databases that are currently available. Primary databases
(DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) are not shown, as they contain raw data. #A database may correspond to multiple categories and only one major
category is shown here.

protein families and domains (e.g., Pfam [23]), reconstruction
of phylogenetic trees (e.g., TreeFam [24]), and proﬁling of pro-
tein structures (e.g., PDB [25]). A representative example of
protein database is PDB, the main primary database for 3D
structures of biological macromolecules determined by X-ray
crystallography and NMR. Established in 1971, PDB contains
105,465 biological macromolecular
structures as of 30
December 2014,
in which 27,393 entries belong to human
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). Another example is the Universal
Protein Resource (UniProt). As a collaborative project
between EMBL-EBI, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB),
and Protein Information Resource (PIR), UniProt provides a
comprehensive, high-quality, and freely-accessible resource of
information. Currently,
protein sequence and functional
UniProt
databases: UniProt
Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), UniProt Reference Clusters
(UniRef), and UniProt Archive (UniParc).
In addition,
UniProtKB consists of two sections: Swiss-Prot (containing a
collection of 547,357 manually-annotated and -reviewed
proteins as of January 2015) and TrEMBL (containing a
collection of 89,451,166 un-reviewed proteins as of January
2015) (http://www.uniprot.org).

includes

Expression databases

Expression databases can be used for various purposes, includ-
ing archiving expression data (e.g., GEO [26]), detecting dif-
ferential and baseline expression (e.g., Expression Atlas [27]),

exploring tissue-speciﬁc gene expression and regulation (e.g.,
TiGER [28]), and proﬁling expression information based on
both RNA and protein data (e.g., Human Protein Atlas [29]).
A representative case of expression database is Human
Protein Atlas. As of 30 December 2014, it encompasses expres-
sion proﬁles for a large majority of human protein-coding genes
based on both RNA (transcriptome analysis based on 213 tis-
sue and cell line samples) and protein data (proteome analysis
based on 24,028 antibodies) (http://www.proteinatlas.org).

Pathway databases

Pathway databases contain biological pathways for metabolic,
signaling, and regulatory pathway analysis. A representative
example is KEGG PATHWAY [30], a curated biological path-
way resource on the molecular interaction and reaction net-
works. As the core of KEGG, KEGG PATHWAY integrates
many entities that are stored in KEGG sibling databases, includ-
ing genes, proteins, RNAs, chemical compounds, and chemical
reactions (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).

Disease databases

There are at least 200 forms of cancer in the world, causing
14.6% of all human deaths (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cancer). Thus, obtaining complete cancer genomes and
identifying molecular mutations and abnormal genes can pro-
vide new insights for cancer prevention, detection, and

(TCGA)

eventually, personalized treatment [31]. Toward this end, there
are two well-known cancer projects, viz., The Cancer Genome
Atlas
[32] and International Cancer Genome
Consortium (ICGC) [33]. TCGA, founded in 2006 by the
National Cancer Institute and National Human Genome
Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, aims
to collect a wide diversity of omics data (including exome,
SNP, mRNA, miRNA, and methylation) for more than 20 dif-
ferent types of human cancer (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).
Unlike TCGA, ICGC is a voluntary collaborative organization
initiated in 2008 and open to all cancer and genomic researchers
in the world. It aims to obtain a comprehensive description of
genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic changes in 50 differ-
ent tumor types and/or subtypes, which are of clinical and soci-
etal importance across the globe (http://icgc.org).

Perspectives

Here we summarize a collection of biological databases rele-
vant to human research. This collection, however, by no means
pictures the whole range of human-related databases that are
currently available. As primary databases store raw data, data-
bases in this collection are most derivative databases, which
are built from primary databases and contain curated informa-
tion for different data types, and thus would be of great useful-
ness for studying the human genome. In the era of big data,
human-related biological databases continue to grow not only
in count but also in volume, posing unprecedented challenges
in data storage, processing, exchange, and curation. From this
point, it would be necessary to establish a cloud computing
platform to store and process such big data and facilitate con-
struction/update of a secondary or derivative database [34]. As
biological databases are physically distributed and heteroge-
neous in data type and format, it is additionally required to
build web open APIs to ease data exchange and sharing among
different resources [35]. The last but not the least is curation,
which becomes an indispensable part in biological databases,
principally because curation involves added value by standard-
ization and quality control and accordingly enhances data
interoperability and consistency [36]. Taken together, biologi-
cal databases hold great utilities for human research and can
be regarded as an indicator of our potential to translate big
data into big discovery. Considering the current situation in
China when compared to other countries, it is our hope that
this report may raise the general awareness, albeit better
improved nowadays, of the signiﬁcant role of human-related
biological databases not only for academic studies but also
for clinical applications.
