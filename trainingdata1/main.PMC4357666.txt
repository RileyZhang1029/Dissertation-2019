Abstract Shigella species and Escherichia coli are closely related organisms. Early phenotyping
experiments and several recent molecular studies put Shigella within the species E. coli. However,
the whole-genome-based, alignment-free and parameter-free CVTree approach shows convincingly
that four established Shigella species, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, Shigella felxneri and Shigella
dysenteriae, are distinct from E. coli strains, and form sister species to E. coli within the genus Esch-
erichia. In view of the overall success and high resolution power of the CVTree approach, this result
should be taken seriously. We hope that the present report may promote further in-depth study of
the Shigella-E. coli relationship.

Introduction

Although description of bacillary dysentery can be traced back
in ancient records, the aetiologic agent was recognized only in
late 19th century. In 1898 Shiga gave a detailed description of
what was called Bacillus dysenteriae, which was assigned a new
genus Shigella later on. Four Shigella species, Shigella dysente-
riae, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei and Shigella ﬂexineri, have
been identiﬁed and listed in several editions of the Bergey’s
Manual, including the latest one [1]. However, it has been

known since the 1970s that DNA–DNA reassociation studies
and a few other phenotyping experiments could not distinguish
these species from Escherichia coli strains (see, e.g.,
[2,3]).
Therefore, these Shigella organisms and E. coli were consid-
ered ‘‘one species genetically’’ [4].

Recent molecular studies further validated the closeness of
the Shigella species and E. coli. Pupo et al. referred to all Shi-
gella strains as ‘‘forms of E. coli’’ by using multilocus enzyme
electrophoresis (MLEE) and a housekeeping gene sequence
study [5]. Later on these authors simply called the Shigella spe-
cies ‘‘clones of E. coli’’ [6], suggesting that the Shigella species
may have originated from different ancestral strains of E. coli
and have undergone convergent evolution to their present sta-
tus. Ogura et al. [7] further constructed a neighbor-joining tree
by using concatenated nucleotide sequences of 345 ortholo-
gous CDS groups from 25 sequenced strains (19 E. coli and
6 Shigella). The Shigella strains again were assigned as
E. coli strains [7].

As sequences of more and more complete genomes become
available, the use of housekeeping genes has been extended to
‘‘core genome’’. For example, 2034 genes from the ‘‘core gen-
ome’’ were selected to construct phylogenetic relationships (22

E. coli and 7 Shigella in [8], see their Figure 3; or 49 E. coli and
7 Shigella in [9], see their Figure 1). In all the aforementioned
studies, the Shigella species were mixed up with the E. coli
strains. Investigation using 16S rRNA segments and in silico
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on a small number
of housekeeping genes [10] led to more scattered results. Even
a recent ‘‘alignment-free’’ study using so-called feature fre-
quency proﬁles [11] placed the Shigella species into the
E. coli strains. There has been a consensus that the Shigella
species are indeed E. coli strains and the nomenclature of the
genus Shigella and species included within this genus has been
kept for historical and medical reasons. No wonder that the
Shigella strains were called E. coli
[12] or
‘‘Machiavellian masqueraders’’ [13].

‘‘in disguise’’

On the other hand, it is curious enough that despite the ge-
netic closeness of the Shigella species and E. coli strains, certain
distinctive ‘‘morphological’’ features do show up. Besides the
diagnosable clinical difference of the dysentery they cause,
there are some other observable dissimilarities. For example,
E. coli strains usually have ﬂagella and are motile, but Shigella
species do not, though their ﬂagella genes may express under
some rare, yet not fully-understood circumstances [14].

As any phylogenetic conclusion drawn from the analysis of
a selected set of sequence segments or genes cannot be unam-
biguously convincing, there is an urgent need for methods that
are not based on any special choice of sequences or genes and
that do not require any adjustment of parameters. A few years
ago we developed such a whole-genome-based, alignment-free,
and parameter-free method [15,16], called CVTree in accor-
dance with the name of the public domain web server CVTree
[17,18]. The CVTree results clearly show that the four Shigella
species as well as all the E. coli strains are well-deﬁned mono-
phyletic clusters of their own; the Shigella species are not
clones of E. coli, but members of the genus Escherichia on
the same footing as the E. coli species. The only possible
change in nomenclature concerns merging the two genera, Shi-
gella and Escherichia, into one genus, but not absorbing the
Shigella strains into the E. coli species.

Though challenging to the current consensus described
above, in view of the overall success of the CVtree approach
and its high resolution power (see, e.g., [19,20]), this conclusion
cannot be simply ignored or negated.

Results and discussion

We shall not reproduce the 2070-population CVTrees in this
report. An interested reader may generate the result by going

to the CVTree web server and ticking the appropriate names
in the list of built-in genomes. We base our discussion on col-
lapsed subtrees cut from the 2070-genome CVTrees. Figure 1
shows the Escherichia-Shigella branch in CVTrees at different
Ks in the ‘‘collapsed-tree’’ notation. At K = 3 (not shown),
there was a monophyletic Shigella{9} branch, but one of the
E. coli genome (one of the ‘‘engineered’’ Waksman strain
KO11LF) escaped from the Escherichia cluster, violating the
monophyleticity of the latter. The situation improves for
K > 3. Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide examples of convergence
of the branching scheme with increasing K. K = 4 is better
than K = 3 and K = 5 and 6 are the best, while K = 7 may
be slightly worse (see our previous publications [19,20]). An
important and consistent fact consists in that all the Shigella
species as well as all the E. coli strains form monophyletic clus-
ters of their own. The Shigella species are never included in the
E. coli branch. Shigella species are sister species to E. coli but
not strains within the E. coli monophyletic branch. We note
that the position of the newly-sequenced genome of E. blattae
in Figure 1 requires further study, but this does not affect the
E. coli-Shigella relationship, which is the main concern of this
work.

The results of this whole-genome-based and alignment-free
CVTree analysis convincingly reconcile the seeming contradic-
tion between the genetic closeness and the ‘‘morphological’’
differences mentioned in the ‘‘Introduction’’ section.

The grouping of the 54 E. coli strains within the monophy-
letic cluster (Figure 2) reﬂects the evolution and taxonomy of
the strains in much the same way as revealed in many previous
studies using different methods (see, e.g., [7–11]). It is remark-
able that the six monophyletic clusters within the E. coli{54}
branch agree well with the phylogroups commonly used to
characterize the E. coli population. This is why we use the
phylogroup labels A, B1 (split into B1a and B1b), B2, D,
and E to name the six groups in Table S1. Group A contains
the commensal strains and their derivatives: the K-12 strains
(MG1655, W3110, BW2952, DH1 and DH10B) and the B
strains (BL21 and REL606) [21]. The Waksman strains (W
[22] and its derivative KO11FL [23]) and the commensal
strains
(ETEC)
E24377A and enteroaggregative (EAEC) 55989 form group
B1b [26]. The virulent enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)
O157:H7 strains [27–30] and their O55:H7 precursors [8,31]
form a monophyletic cluster E. The three non-O157 EHEC

phylogroup B1 strains (O26, O103 and O111) [7] join the other
phylogroup B1a. The many uropathogenic (UPEC) strains of
phylogroup B2 form a large lowermost cluster B2. Note that
though the separation of E. coli strains into clusters agrees
basically with [7–11] and other studies, the Shigella strains al-
ways stay clearly outside the E. coli monophyletic branch. As
the main aim of this report is to emphasize the fact that Shi-
gella species are members of the genus Escherichia, not strains
of E. coli, we postpone the detailed comparison of the inner
structure of the subclusters within the E. coli{54} branch to
a later publication.

strains

We mention in passing that a similar story is told by the
Yersinia pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis
in the
CVTrees. Strains from these two species could not be distin-
guished by DNA-DNA hybridization. Therefore, a proposal
was made to combine these two species into one. However,
‘‘. . . the change was rejected by the Judicial Commission be-
cause of possible danger to public health if there was confusion
regarding Y. pestis, the plague bacillus’’ [32]. In the same 2070-
population CVTrees, we see Yersinia{19} K3K4K5K6K7, Y.
pestis{12}
pseudotuberculosis{4}
K4K5K6K7 and Y. enterocolitica{3} K3K4K5K6K7. Conse-
quently, the genus Yersinia and the three species therein are
all well-deﬁned and there is no worry for the taxonomic Judi-
cial Commission.

Y.

It should be pointed out that we did not carry out any case
study for a group of selected organisms. Instead, we generated
CVTrees for all 2062 Archaea and Bacteria genomes, cut and
scrutinized the interested branch. The results demonstrated
the high resolution power of CVTrees at the subspecies level
and below. This resolution is beyond the reach of the 16S
rRNA analysis. Concatenation of a large number of nucleotide
or protein sequences such as done in [5–9] may lead to seem-
ingly comparable resolution, but the somewhat subjective
selection of sequences or genes brings about ambiguity and
makes the conclusion less convincing.

With the progress of the new generations of sequencing
techniques, the cost of sequencing a bacterial genome will soon
drop below that of an average phenotyping experiment and the
number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes keeps growing rap-
idly. Among the genomes released at the NCBI FTP site (ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/), there are more and more
strains coming from the same species. For example, for the
time being, complete genome sequences of ten or more strains
are available for Chlamydia trachomatis, Corynebacterium
diphtheriae, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica, Staphylo-
coccus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyoge-
nes, Sulfolobus islandicus, Y. pestis, etc. Once the genomes have
been sequenced, there is no additional cost to getting the inter-
relationship of the strains by simply submitting the genomes to
the CVTree Web Server. We encourage researchers to try out
this convenient and effective tool.

Materials and methods

Since the CVTree approach has been described repeatedly in
previous publications (see [15–20] and references therein), we
only give a brief summary in order to introduce notations
and concepts needed in what follows.

CVTree is a whole-genome-based approach. It makes use of
all the protein products encoded in a given genome. In this way

it circumvents the problem of lateral gene transfer (LGT) as
LGT and lineage-dependent gene loss are merely mechanisms
of genome evolution. User avoids the tedious task of ﬁnding
orthologous proteins as well, since all genomes are ortholo-
gous as they are descended from a common ancestor.

The methodology of CVTree must be alignment-free due to
the extreme diversity of bacterial genomes in their size and
gene content. By using a sliding window of width K, a primary
protein sequence made of L amino acids is replaced by
(L   K + 1) peptides of length K. The number of K-peptides
from all the protein products in a genome is counted and these
counts are put in lexicographic order of all possible K-peptides
over the 20 amino acid letters to form a raw composition vec-
tor (CV) of dimension 20K. Then a random background
caused by neutral mutations is subtracted from each raw count
to highlight the role of natural selection by using a (K   2)th
order Markovian prediction formula. The subtraction proce-
dure is crucial to the success of CVTree. A recalculated CV
represents a species and a dissimilarity/distance measure is
deﬁned between each pair of CVs. Then a phylogenetic tree is
constructed by using the standard neighbor-joining algorithm
which has been proved to be a robust quartet-based method [33].
Being alignment-free renders the method parameter-free, as
sequence alignment involves many parameters embodied in the
elements of scoring matrices and gap penalties. The peptide
length K is not a parameter. Longer Ks make emphasis on spe-
cies-speciﬁcity, while shorter Ks reﬂect common features be-
tween different species. We never adjust K value. Five trees
are calculated for K = 3–7 (there is no need to go beyond
K = 7) and the improved agreement of the tree topology with
taxonomy when K increases provides an additional angle to
evaluate the quality of the resulted trees.

In order to facilitate the use of the new method by biolo-
gists practitioners, a web server entitled CVTree was published
in 2004 [17]. A signiﬁcantly-improved version was released in
2009 [18]. Just by entering the URL (http://tlife.fudan.e-
du.cn/cvtree/) into a browser, user can enjoy playing with
CVTree. The built-in dataset is updated automatically in the
beginning of each month from the NCBI FTP site. Users
may also upload their own data to CVTree, these data will
be kept only for 48 h after the last run of the job. The results
may be displayed online or sent back to users by email. In the
latter case, there is a directory named Collapsed-trees with
many ﬁles in Newick (.nwk) or plain text format. The notion
of collapsed trees requires special explanation.

Although statistical re-sampling methods such as bootstrap
or jackknife have been designed to check the stability and self-
consistency of the CVTree results [34], the CVTrees are veriﬁed
by direct comparison with prokaryote systematics at all taxo-
nomic ranks from domain down to genera and species. In
doing so, the monophyleticity of a branch is taken as a guide-
line. When all genomes from one and the same taxon in the in-
put dataset appear in the same branch and no other genomes
fall in, one may collapse the branch to a single leave named
after the taxon. For example, Escherichia_coli{54} means that
all 54 E. coli genomes appear in a monophyletic branch at a
given K. In fact, we have the E. coli strains making a mono-
phyletic branch at all K-values from 4 to 7, which is denoted
as ‘‘Escherichia_coli{54} K4K5K6K7’’. For the time being,
this kind of ‘‘convergence lists’’ has to be obtained by manual
inspection of the corresponding ﬁles returned via email by the
CVTree web server. Automatic generation of such lists at all

64

taxonomic ranks will be implemented in the next release of the
CVTree web server.

Throughout this paper we use the abbreviation CVTree to
denote the method, the CVTree web server, and the phyloge-
netic tree obtained by using the CVTree web server.

In the present study, we have used all the prokaryote gen-
omes released at the NCBI FTP site as of 30 September
2012, excluding 14 tiny highly-degenerated genomes of bacte-
rial endosymbiont bacteria. The 54 E. coli genomes, listed in
Table S1 in the Supplementary material, are divided into six
groups, corresponding to the six monophyletic clusters within
the monophyletic E. coli{54} branch in CVTrees for K = 4–7
(see Figure 2). We note that 49 [9] and 53 [10] E. coli genomes
from GenBank were used, respectively. There are minor differ-
ences in the lists as we used all the genomes released by NCBI
with accession number starting with NC_ in order to have bet-
ter comparability. The 9 Shigella genomes used in the present
study are listed in Table S2.

When constructing the phylogenetic trees, we used all 133
Archaea genomes and 1929 Bacteria genomes, including the
54 E. coli and 9 Shigella genomes. We excluded 14 tiny
highly-degenerated genomes of endosymbiont bacteria (Can-
didatus Carsonella, C. Hodgkinia, C. Sulcia, C. Tremblaya,
and C. Zinderia), as they would violate the trifurcation of
the three main domains of life. Eight Eukarya genomes were
included as outgroups. Altogether it led to a treeing job with
133 + 1929 + 8 = 2070 population.
