ABSTRACT

Sporulation in low-G+C gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes)

is
an important survival mechanism that involves up to 150 genes,
acting in a highly regulated manner. Many sporulation genes have
close homologs in non-sporulating bacteria, including cyanobacteria,
proteobacteria and spirochaetes, indicating that their products play
a wider biological role. Most of them have been characterized as
regulatory proteins or enzymes of peptidoglycan turnover; functions
of others remain unknown but they are likely to have a general
role in cell division and/or development. We have compiled a list
of such widely conserved sporulation and germination proteins with
poorly characterized functions, ranked them by the width of their
phylogenetic distribution, and performed detailed sequence analysis
and, where possible, structural modeling aimed at estimating their
potential functions. Here we report the results of sequence analysis
of Bacillus subtilis spore germination protein GerM, suggesting that
it is a widespread cell development protein, whose function might
involve binding to peptidoglycan. GerM consists of two tandem
copies of a new domain (designated the GERMN domain) that forms
phylum-speciﬁc fusions with two other newly described domains,
GERMN-associated domains 1 and 2 (GMAD1 and GMAD2). Fold
recognition reveals a β-propeller fold for GMAD1, while ab initio
modeling suggests that GMAD2 adopts a ﬁbronectin type III fold.
SpoVS is predicted to adopt the AlbA archaeal chromatin protein
fold, which suggests that it is a DNA-binding protein, most likely a
novel transcriptional regulator.

1 INTRODUCTION
Cell division remains one of the least understood processes in the
life of the bacterial cell. In stark contrast to the signiﬁcant progress in
the understanding of microbial metabolism and signal transduction
brought about by the complete genome sequences, the contribution
of genomics to the studies of cell division has been relatively
modest. Some cell division proteins are still poorly characterized
and the importance of the presence or absence of a certain gene
in a given genome cannot be readily interpreted as it is being
done for the metabolic enzymes. In addition, cell division involves

numerous protein–protein interactions, so mutant phenotypes are
fairly complex, making their formal description (e.g. using the
Gene Ontology system) almost impossible. Finally, preliminary
characterization of such genes in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis
or other bacteria usually results in assigning them stable names, e.g.
‘cell division protein FtsN’, which often creates an illusion of at
least some understanding and obscures the fact that the functions of
these proteins remain enigmatic.

Sporulation in B.subtilis and other low-G+C gram-positive
bacteria (Firmicutes) is an important survival mechanism that is
related to cell division and involves up to 150 genes, acting in
a highly regulated manner (Piggot and Losick, 2002). Mutational
analyses and transcriptional proﬁling revealed the timing of action
of each sporulation gene and suggested functions for most of
them. In some cases, deduced functions have been veriﬁed by
structural analysis or direct biochemical experiments, mostly on
proteins from B.subtilis. Phylogenetic distribution of B.subtilis
sporulation genes is quite complex (Onyenwoke et al., 2004; Wu
et al., 2005). Many of them have regulatory roles and appear to
be non-essential for spore formation. Accordingly, such genes may
be missing in certain bacillar and clostridial genomes. On the other
hand, close homologs of several sporulation genes can be found
in the genomes of non-sporulating microorganisms (Onyenwoke
et al., 2004). Such genes typically encode cell division proteins, e.g.
SpoVD (FtsI) or SpoVE (FtsW), enzymes of peptidoglycan turnover,
or components of bacterial signaling systems, such as sensory
histidine kinases, response regulators, alternative sigma factors and
other transcriptional regulators (Piggot and Losick, 2002). However,
function of many sporulation genes remains unknown, including
some that have wide phylogenetic distribution and are found in
a variety of non-sporulating bacteria. It would be reasonable to
assume that widespread functionally uncharacterized sporulation
genes encode additional components of bacterial division or signal
transduction machinery. We have set out to identify such genes and
analyze their likely functions using a combination of sequence and
structure analysis tools. Here we report the results of domain analysis
and structural modeling of two widespread proteins from this group,
GerM and SpoVS.

2 METHODS
The initial list of B.subtilis sporulation proteins was compiled from published
sources (Errington, 2003; Onyenwoke et al., 2004; Piggot and Losick, 2002).
Phylogenetic distribution of each protein was judged based on the species

lists in the Pfam (Finn et al., 2008), CDD (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2007) and
COG (Tatusov et al., 2000) databases, where available, and veriﬁed using
PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) searches, employing an e-value of 0.01,
ﬁltered to exclude hits from the Firmicutes. The search results were sorted
using the ‘Taxonomy reports’option in BLAST outputs. Domain composition
of the retrieved sequences was analyzed by comparing them against Pfam,
CDD and COGs with e-values of below 0.01 taken to represent signiﬁcant
hits.

Possible templates for modeling were sought at the META server, a
portal to the several fold recognition methods (Bujnicki et al., 2001)
and to the 3D-Jury consensus method, by which scores of over 50 are
taken as highly conﬁdent (Ginalski et al., 2003). Distant homologies
were also sought with HHpred (Soding et al., 2005) using a cut-off of
e < 0.01. Secondary structures were predicted using PSI-PRED (Jones,
1999).

Template-based modeling was carried out with MODELLER (Sali
and Blundell, 1993). Five variant models were constructed after an
initial coordinate randomization step. PROCHECK (Laskowski et al.,
1993) was used for their stereochemical evaluation and VERIFY_3D
(Lüthy et al., 1992) and PROSA II (Sippl, 1993) employed for model
ranking by solvent exposure and residue–residue contacts. ROSETTA
was used for ab initio model building using default protocols:
2000 individual models were constructed from 3- and 9-residue
segments using Monte Carlo substitution and optimization protocols and
clustered based on RMSD calculations (Simons et al., 1997, 1999).
I-TASSER (Lee and Skolnick, 2007) ab initio models were obtained
from the web server
(http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER/).
I-TASSER models and coordinates for centre models of each ROSETTA
cluster were submitted to the DALI server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/; Holm
and Sander, 1993) for structural comparison to the Protein Data Bank
(PDB). By DALI, Z-scores of <2 are insigniﬁcant. Side chains were
added to the best ROSETTA model using SCWRL (Canutescu et al.,
2003).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Sporulation genes in non-sporulating bacteria
Earlier studies identiﬁed homologs of B.subtilis sporulation genes
in a variety of non-sporulating bacteria both within and outside
of the phylum Firmicutes (Onyenwoke et al., 2004; Wu et al.,
2005). In order to identify widely conserved sporulation genes,
we have looked only for those that have close homologs outside
the Firmicute phylum. The resulting list was winnowed down
by manually removing known transcriptional regulators, signal
transduction proteins, sigma subunits of the RNA polymerase, anti-
sigma and anti-anti-sigma factors, enzymes involved in synthesis
or hydrolysis of peptidoglycan and previously characterized cell
division proteins. Further, detailed analysis of the remaining
proteins showed that for some of them functional assignments
either had been made or could be made very easily, based on
recent experimental data or convincing sequence similarity to
experimentally characterized proteins. After these proteins were
removed,
list (Supplementary Table 1) included 20
previously uncharacterized ‘sporulation’ and ‘germination’ proteins
that had close homologs in more than three different bacterial phyla.
We applied a battery of bioinformatics analyses to yield insights into
possible functions and present here results for GerM and SpoVS.

3.2 GerM protein and associated domains
B.subtilis protein GerM has been implicated in both sporulation
and spore germination (Sammons et al., 1987; Slynn et al., 1994),
suggesting an important role in cell development. According to
the COG database, orthologs of GerM (COG5401) are encoded
in spirochaetes and cyanobacteria. Indeed, a PSI-BLAST search of
complete genome sequences using GERM_BACSU protein (Swiss-
Prot accession P39072) as a query and run to convergence retrieved
more than 150 proteins (last searched April 1, 2008), encoded
in Firmicutes and members of other bacterial phyla, including
Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Deinococcus–
Thermus group. These searches revealed that GerM from B.subtilis
and other bacilli contains tandem copies of a ∼100 amino acid-
long domain, hereafter called the GERMN domain (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 1). In other ﬁrmicutes, this domain was found
mostly in a stand-alone form, whereas Moorella thermoacetica and
several other clostridia encoded both a stand-alone and a duplicated
version. In a single species in the current database, Halothermothrix
orenii, GERMN is fused to the amidase (PF01520) domain which
cleaves amide bonds in cell wall peptidoglycans.

In addition,

the GERMN domain was found fused,

in a
phylum-speciﬁc fashion, to two further novel domains (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3) named GERMN-associated
domains 1 and 2 (GMAD1 and GMAD2). GERMN, GMAD1
and GMAD2 have been deposited with the Pfam database,
receiving accession numbers PF10646, PF10647 and PF10648,
respectively. The GERMN entry replaces and extends a PfamB
entry PB005693 (in Pfam 22.0), which only covered the ﬁrst two
domain architectures shown on Figure 1. In Firmicutes, orthologs of
GerM protein, containing duplicated GERMN domain are encoded
in spore-forming clostridia and bacilli, but not in non-sporogenous
lactobacilli, staphylococci or streptococci. Every sequenced genome
of Actinobacteria encodes a GERMN-GMAD1 domain fusion that is
referred to as ‘putative lipoprotein LpqB’ although the origin of this
name seems obscure. The lpqB gene, nearly always found adjacent
to the genes encoding the two-component system MtrAB, has

been proposed to modulate the function of these signaling proteins
(Hoskisson and Hutchings, 2006). Deletion of MtrA and MtrB in
Corynebacterium glutamicum leads to increased susceptibility to
cell wall targeting vancomycin and lysozyme as well as to cell
elongation (Moker et al., 2004). Thus the MtrAB double mutant
appears to have cell envelope and cell division defects. The function
of this pair is intriguingly similar to that of YycFG (VicRK) system
in the Firmicutes (Aravind et al., 2003).

The importance of the GERMN domain is underscored by the
fact that it is encoded in all completely sequenced genomes of
representatives of such phyla as Spirochaetes and Deinococcus–
Thermus,
including the relatively small genomes of obligate
parasites Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum. The
GERMN domain is also encoded in many cyanobacterial genomes.
Screening GERMN-containing proteins with PROSITE (Hulo
et al., 2008) prokaryotic lipoprotein (PS51257) motif revealed
their strong association with this predicted post-translational
modiﬁcation. Single GERMN sequences were predicted lipoproteins
in 48/120 cases. The ﬁgure for twin GERMN sequences (e.g. GerM)
is 33/39, for GERMN-GMAD1 it is 30/36 and for GERMN-GMAD2
it is 6/11. We then considered whether modeling, comparative or
ab initio, or domain context could shed light on the functions of
these domains. None of the fold recognition methods implemented
at the META server (Bujnicki et al., 2001) gave signiﬁcant results for
either the GERMN or the GMAD2 domains. In the case of GERMN,
taking a consensus view of secondary structure predictions for
different proteins, the fold seems to contain the following principal
elements of regular secondary structure—ββααββααββ. The lack of
signiﬁcant hits suggests that GERMN has a novel α + β type fold.
Ab initio modeling was unsuccessful for GERMN.

The GMAD2-predicted secondary structure indicates an all-β-fold
containing approximately nine β-strands. Several methods rated the
immunoglobulin-type fold most highly but with scores not high
enough for conﬁdent fold assignment. Ab initio modeling with
ROSETTA was also unsuccessful, but, suggestively, all ﬁve models
obtained by ab initio modeling at the I-TASSER server shared the
same fold, matched signiﬁcantly by DALI (Z-scores up to 7.5) to
immunoglobulin-type structures. Among these the top scores were
for matches to ﬁbronectin type III (FnIII) domains. These have
structural roles in animals, but are also present in bacteria, where
they are often associated with glycoside hydrolase enzymes (Bork
and Doolittle, 1992; Little et al., 1994). Browsing of the current Pfam
database (release 22.0) conﬁrms the strong association between this
domain and carbohydrate metabolism, as shown by its presence,
with few exceptions, alongside catalytic domains that clearly act on
carbohydrates. At a molecular level, bacterial FnIII domains act as
spacers between catalytic and substrate-binding domains (Toratani
et al., 2006) while structurally similar bacterial β-sandwich domains
have a direct carbohydrate-binding function (Jee et al., 2002). The
GMAD2 domain is found combined with LysM domains in two
distinct architectures (Fig. 1). LysM domains were ﬁrst associated
with peptidoglycan binding (Steen et al., 2003), although recent
data show that some examples bind chitin or lipochitin (Spaink,
2004; Onaga and Taira, 2008). Speciﬁcity for carbohydrate ligand
therefore seems to vary between LysM domains.

The GMAD1 domain gave strong hits to β-propeller folds by fold
recognition methods at the META server, consistent with earlier
data (Hoskisson and Hutchings, 2006). Interestingly, WD40-type
7-bladed propellers consistently achieved the top scores (up to 96

Sequence analysis of GerM and SpoVS

by 3D-Jury). However, the WD motifs themselves are absent and
such propellers are, in any case, rare in bacteria and generally
contain more blades than the ﬁve or six predicted for GMAD1
(Neer et al., 1994). Unfortunately, the β-propeller fold assignment
provides few clues as to the function of the GMAD1 domain
since β-propellers are involved in a wide variety of binding and
catalytic functions. A certain tendency towards sugar binding
and metabolism is evident in the functions of smaller 5- and
6-bladed β-propellers of known structure; 2 of the 3 superfamilies
of 5-bladed propellers and 4 of the 11 superfamilies of 6-bladed
propellers have these functions (Andreeva et al., 2008). However,
β-propellers are also known as protein–protein interaction domains,
so the interaction mentioned above between LpqB, a GerMN-
GMAD1 domain fusion protein and the MtrAB system could
be mediated by the GMAD1 propeller. The presence of only a
single conserved hydrophilic residue, an Arg, in an alignment
of GMAD1 domains, would be more consistent with a passive
binding role than with a catalytic function (Koonin and Galperin,
2002).

Intriguingly, a direct connection can be made with PSI-BLAST
between a GERMN query and Streptococcus pneumoniae Wzd,
a component of the capsule polysaccharide export machinery
(Aanensen et al., 2007). The match appears in the third iteration
in the form of an ungapped 56 residue alignment with a bit score
of 43 and an e-value of 0.006. As yet, no Wzd structure exists with
which to assess the signiﬁcance of this match.

3.3 SpoVS protein
Mutations in B.subtilis spoVS gene block sporulation at Stage V but
allow the spoIIBspoVG double mutant to bypass the sporulation
block at Stage II (Resnekov et al., 1995). According to the
Pfam database, proteins with the SpoVS domain (PF04232), in
addition to ﬁrmicutes, are encoded in members of the bacterial
phyla Chloroﬂexi, Thermotogae and Deinococcus–Thermus. This
is consistent with results of PSI-BLAST searches, which detect
orthologs of B.subtilis SpoVS (SP5S_BACSU, Swiss-Prot accession
P45693) in every completely sequenced genome of these phyla.
In ﬁrmicutes, SpoVS is found in sporulating bacilli and clostridia,
but not in non-sporulating lactobacilli, listeria, staphylococci or
streptococci.

PSI-BLAST searches failed to reveal any distant homologs of
SpoVS. At the META server, the single match scoring above the
3D-Jury conﬁdence threshold of 50 (Ginalski et al., 2003) was
between Thermotoga maritima SpoVS and Sulfolobus solfataricus
Alba (PDB code 1h0x; Wardleworth et al., 2002) with a score
of 53. An excellent match between predicted secondary structure
for SpoVS and the actual secondary structure of Alba was seen
(Supplementary Fig. 4). In order to assess the compatibility of the
SpoVS sequences and the Alba fold in more detail, modeling was
carried out. We modeled the T.maritima protein TM1059 which,
among those we tested, achieved the best 3D-Jury score. The
S.solfataricus Alba structure was used as template. Although there
are no experimental data regarding the SpoVS oligomeric state we
supposed that it might exist, like Alba and likely its most closely
related families of relatives (Aravind et al., 2003), as a dimer, a
hypothesis supported by the presence in the dimer model of a large
hydrophobic interface between the subunits. The modeling showed
that indels between SpoVS and Alba could be readily accommodated

and the ﬁnal model has favorable VERIFY_3D and PROSA II
proﬁles and an optimal pG value (Sanchez and Sali, 1998) of 1.0.

Ab initio modeling of B.subtilis SpoVS lent further support for
its structural correspondence with Alba. The top cluster of 2000
ROSETTA models contained many more models, 268, than the next
most populated cluster (81) indicative of likely success. Indeed, the
top cluster centre gave a highly signiﬁcant Z-score of 9.3 by DALI,
far in excess of the 3.3–5.6 achieved by other cluster centres. The
top cluster centre matched S.solfataricus Alba and corresponded to
an alignment of 81 residues with a Cα RMSD of 2.2 Å. For the top
I-TASSER model the corresponding ﬁgures were Z-score of 13.2
for an alignment of 84 residues with a Cα RMSD of 1.5 Å.

As shown in Figure 2, the top ROSETTA and I-TASSER models
of B.subtilis SpoVS and the homology model of T.maritima TM1059
are remarkably similar. We interpret the ability of ab initio modeling
to produce the Alba fold as strong evidence that this is indeed the
correct fold assignment for the SpoVS family.

The Alba fold is strongly linked with the broad function of
nucleic acid binding. Although Alba itself binds DNA, homologs
recognizable by iterative database searching include several families
of RNA binding proteins (Aravind et al., 2003). Furthermore,
Alba’s IF3-C fold is found in many other families lacking sequence
similarity but recognizable at
level. As reported
(Aravind et al., 2003), and veriﬁed in the current SCOP database,
this fold is strongly associated with nucleic acid binding.

the structural

The comparative SpoVS model has the signiﬁcant dipole
characteristic of nucleic acid binding proteins (Szilagyi and
Skolnick, 2006). The positively charged face (see Supplementary
Fig. 5), also seen for the ab initio models (data not shown)
corresponds to a similarly positively charged surface in the Alba
dimer (Wardleworth et al., 2002) that has been convincingly
modeled as forming its interface with duplex DNA.

4 CONCLUSIONS
Our census (Supplementary Table 1) and the work of others
(Errington, 2003; Onyenwoke et al., 2004; Piggot and Losick, 2002);
show that many ‘sporulation’ and ‘germination’ proteins are in
fact of broad phyletic distribution. Furthermore, their annotation
as being involved in these processes often obscures a real lack of
knowledge of their molecular functions. Here, we have attempted in-
depth sequence analysis of some of them. Three novel domains are
described which will contribute to extending Pfam coverage towards
its upper limit (Sammut et al., 2008).

The strong theme emerging from domain context analysis
of GERMN (Fig. 1) and the available structure predictions is
carbohydrate binding. We therefore propose that
the GERMN
domain interacts with bacterial carbohydrate. With the separate
implication of the GERMN domain in cell envelope and division
for GerM (Sammons et al., 1987; Slynn et al., 1994) and
LpqB (Moker et al., 2004),
likely carbohydrate targets would
be peptidoglycan and/or capsule polysaccharide. The former is
supported by associations with the amidase and LysM domains
(Fig. 1), while the PSI-BLAST link from GERMN to Wzd hints
at the latter possibility.

Experimental data regarding SpoVS are apparently limited to
two reports (Resnekov et al., 1995; Perez et al., 2006). In the
ﬁrst, mutation of the spoVS gene halted sporulation at Stage V
and reduced expression of two σ K -directed genes, cotA and gerE

(Resnekov et al., 1995). On the other hand, spoVS mutation increases
σ D-directed gene expression, cell separation and autolysis (Perez et
al., 2006). These sigma factors direct RNA polymerase to transcribe
certain sets of genes and, along with other DNA-binding regulators
such as GerE and SpoIIID, form complex networks that control
sporulation (Eichenberger et al., 2004). Along with our structure-
based prediction, these data suggest that SpoVS is a further member
of these networks and, by binding to speciﬁc DNA sites, inﬂuences
the transcriptional proﬁle of the cell during the onset of sporulation.
