Abstract

Motivation: Network comparison is a computationally intractable problem with important applica-
tions in systems biology and other domains. A key challenge is to properly quantify similarity
between wiring patterns of two networks in an alignment-free fashion. Also, alignment-based
methods exist that aim to identify an actual node mapping between networks and as such serve a
different purpose. Various alignment-free methods that use different global network properties
(e.g. degree distribution) have been proposed. Methods based on small local subgraphs called
graphlets perform the best in the alignment-free network comparison task, due to high level of
topological detail that graphlets can capture. Among different graphlet-based methods, Graphlet
Correlation Distance (GCD) was shown to be the most accurate for comparing networks. Recently,
a new graphlet-based method called NetDis was proposed, which was claimed to be superior.
We argue against this, as the performance of NetDis was not properly evaluated to position it
correctly among the other alignment-free methods.
Results: We evaluate the performance of available alignment-free network comparison methods,
including GCD and NetDis. We do this by measuring accuracy of each method (in a systematic
precision-recall framework) in terms of how well the method can group (cluster) topologically simi-
lar networks. By testing this on both synthetic and real-world networks from different domains, we
show that GCD remains the most accurate, noise-tolerant and computationally efﬁcient alignment-
free method. That is, we show that NetDis does not outperform the other methods, as originally
claimed, while it is also computationally more expensive. Furthermore, since NetDis is dependent
on the choice of a network null model (unlike the other graphlet-based methods), we show that its
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of this parameter. Finally, we ﬁnd that its performance
is not independent on network sizes and densities, as originally claimed.

1 Introduction

Networks (or graphs) are widely used for representing different types
of relational data in the cell, such as protein–protein (Prasad et al.,
2009; Stark et al., 2006), genetic (Tong et al., 2004), metabolic
(Okuda et al., 2008) and gene regulatory (Hu et al., 2007; Lee et al.,

2002) interactions. The information encoded in the wiring patterns
(i.e. topology, or structure) of biological networks complements the
information obtained from protein sequence and structure (Pevzner
and Shamir, 2011). Because of this, graph-theoretic analyses of biolo-
gical networks can advance our understanding of fundamental cellular
functioning.

When analysing biological networks, one needs to compare
them. For example, evolutionary insights can be gained by identify-
ing topological similarities between networks of different species
(Singh et al., 2008). The difficulty is that network comparison is
computationally intractable (Cook, 1971), so heuristic approaches
that produce approximate solutions are the only feasible way to
compare networks.

Further potential fallacies with the NetDis method itself exist, such
as its dependence on the choice of a network null model, which was
not taken into account in the original NetDis study (Ali et al.,
2014). Thus, here we systematically and fairly evaluate the perform-
ance of NetDis in comparison to other alignment-free network com-
parison methods, and address all issues present in the paper by Ali
et al. (2014).

topological

Depending on the purpose of the network comparison, relevant
approaches can be split into two major sub-categories: (i) alignment-
based network comparison and (ii)
alignment-free network
comparison. Alignment-based methods aim to find a mapping be-
tween the nodes of two (or more) networks that preserves many edges
and a large subgraph between the networks. These methods are useful
for identifying the evolutionary conserved parts of biological net-
works, and they enable the transfer of functional annotations between
aligned network regions across species (Faisal et al., 2014; Ibragimov
et al., 2013, 2014; Kelley et al., 2003; Kuchaiev and Przˇulj, 2011;
Liao et al., 2009; Neyshabur et al., 2013; Saraph and Milenkovic´,
2014) and the identification of structural similarities between proteins
(Malod-Dognin and Przˇulj, 2014; Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). On the
other hand, alignment-free network comparison methods aim to
quantify the overall
similarity between networks,
irrespective of node mappings between the networks, and without
intending
subgraphs.
These methods have applications in evaluating the fit of a random net-
work model to a real-world network (Hayes et al., 2013; Przˇulj,
2007; Przˇulj et al., 2004; Rito et al., 2010), tracking the dynamics of
time-series networks (Garlaschelli and Loffredo, 2005; Kossinets and
Watts, 2006; Yaverog˘lu et al., 2014) or grouping (clustering) of
networks based on their topological similarities (Milo et al., 2004).
The clustering can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships
of species based on similarities of their networks (Ali et al., 2014).
Alignment-free

computationally less expensive than alignment-based methods,
and again, they do not produce a node mapping between the
compared networks, but a score that quantifies the overall similarity
between
and
alignment-based network comparison methods have different pur-
poses. Thus, comparing the approaches across the two groups might
be misleading.

graph spectra (Thorne and Stumpf, 2012; Wilson and Zhu, 2008)
for quantifying the overall similarity between two networks.
Currently, the best alignment-free network comparison method is
based on graphlets, small subgraphs of large networks (Przˇulj et al.,
2004), called Graphlet Correlation Distance (GCD; Yaverog˘ lu
et al., 2014). GCD was systematically compared both with graphlet-
based and non-graphlet-based alignment-free predecessors, and it
was shown to be the most accurate in clustering topologically simi-
lar networks, the most noise-tolerant and the most computationally
efficient. Subsequently, another graphlet-based alignment-free
method called NetDis was proposed (Ali et al., 2014). Although the
suggested methodology of NetDis is interesting (Section 2.1), the
claimed superior performance of NetDis over the existing state-of-
the-art network comparison methods is questionable. This is be-
cause the performance of NetDis was not systematically evaluated,
so its claimed superiority might be inaccurate. For example, NetDis
was not compared against GCD. Also, its comparison against an
alignment-based method, based on which almost all conclusions of
its superiority were drawn,
is inappropriate, as argued above.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Alignment-free network comparison methods
Alignment-free network comparison involves quantifying the overall
topological similarity between two networks. As the exact solution
is computationally intractable, approximate solutions have been
devised for this purpose. Such approximate solutions are conven-
tionally called network distance or network similarity measures.

2.2 Network distance measures based on global
network properties:
The overall similarity between two networks can be quantified in a
simple fashion by comparing the networks’ global properties, such
as
the degree distribution, clustering coefficient or diameter
(Newman, 2010). The most sophisticated of these network proper-
ties are based on graph spectra (Thorne and Stumpf, 2012; Wilson
and Zhu, 2008). Although network comparison methods based on
global properties are computationally efficient, they usually capture
limited aspects of complex wirings of real-world networks. For this
reason, it is no surprise that they perform poorly in grouping topo-
logically similar networks together and separating dissimilar net-
works (Yaverog˘ lu et al., 2014). Hence, local network properties
have been proposed, which can capture the topology of complex
networks in more detail.

2.3 Network distance measures based on local
network properties
Graphlets are small, connected, non-isomorphic, induced subgraphs
of a network (Przˇulj et al., 2004). Each graphlet contains ‘symmet-
rical node groups’ known as automorphism orbits (Fig. 1; Przˇulj,
2007). Graphlets can be used to derive detailed descriptors of net-
work topology at network, node and edge level (Milenkovic´ and
Przˇulj, 2008; Solava et al., 2012; Yaverog˘ lu et al., 2014). By using
graphlets in different ways, four different alignment-free network
comparison measures are defined:

(Przˇulj, 2007)

Proper evaluation of alignment-free methods

1. Relative graphlet frequency distance (RGFD): The topology of a
network can be described by the number of times that each
graphlet appears in the network. RGFD is a non-parametric
method that uses the graphlet frequency statistics of 3- to 5-node
graphlets to quantify the overall difference between two net-
works (Przˇulj et al., 2004). Given the 29-dimensional graphlet
frequency vectors of two networks, RGFD ﬁrst normalizes these
vectors based on the total number of graphlets that appear in the
networks, and then, it computes the sum of absolute differ-
ences between the normalized graphlet frequencies. The result-
ing score indicates the topological difference between the two
networks.

2. Graphlet degree distribution agreement (GDDA): Graphlets are
also used to deﬁne detailed descriptors of the wiring around a
node in a network. Namely, the ith graphlet degree of a node is
the number of graphlets that the node touches at orbit i.
The graphlet degree vector (GDV) of a node is the 73-
dimensional vector containing graphlet degrees for the 73
automorphism orbits shown in Figure 1 (Milenkovic´ and
Przˇulj, 2008). Considering GDVs of all nodes in a given net-
work, the degree distribution can be extended into 73 graphlet
degree distributions (GDD), where each GDD corresponds to
the graphlet degrees of one of the 73 orbits. Given two net-
works, the non-parametric GDDA method compares these 73
GDDs and quantiﬁes the overall topological similarity between
the two networks as an average over all 73 comparisons (Przˇulj,
2007). GDDA scores are scaled between 0 and 1, and higher
scores indicate better topological similarity.

3. Graphlet correlation distance (GCD): Graphlets are Lego-like
pieces that assemble with each other at different orientations to
build large networks. Exploiting this observation, the complex
structure of any network can be summarized into an n n
graphlet correlation matrix, where n is the number of considered
graphlet orbits (Yaverog˘ lu et al., 2014). Each cell of this matrix
quantiﬁes the level of dependency between two graphlet orbits
in the network. For a given network, the cell values are com-
puted by Spearman’s correlation between the corresponding
graphlet degrees over all nodes in the network. Then, GCD com-
putes the Euclidean distance between graphlet correlation matri-
ces of two networks (Yaverog˘ lu et al., 2014). As RGFD and
GDDA, GCD is non-parametric and it does not require any net-
work null model for the computation. Different GCD versions
exist depending on the orbits that are used for constructing the
matrices: (i) GCD-73 accounts for the complete set of 73 orbits
from all 2- to 5-node graphlets and (ii) GCD-11 accounts for 11
non-redundant orbits of 2- to 4-node graphlets (i.e. orbits 0, 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). In our experiments, we choose to use
GCD-11 and GCD-73 rather than other GCD versions because
GCD-11 is shown to perform the best in grouping topologically
similar networks (Yaverog˘ lu et al., 2014) and because GCD-73
considers all the orbits of typically used 2- to 5-node graphlets.

4. NetDis: This most recent graphlet-based alignment-free network
comparison method (Ali et al., 2014) ﬁrst obtains ego-networks
of radius two (i.e. subgraphs induced on the nodes that are in
the ﬁrst and second neighbourhood of a given node) for each
node in a given network and computes the number of graphlets
in each of the resulting ego-networks. Then, NetDis compares
these graphlet counts with the graphlet counts from the same
density ego-networks of a ‘gold-standard network’ (i.e. network
null model). It then represents the structure of the given network
with a vector containing the sum of the ‘centred’ graphlet counts
of all ego-networks, where the centring is performed by

computing the difference between the observed and expected
(obtained from the gold-standard network) graphlet counts of
the ego-networks. Finally, NetDis computes the distance be-
tween two given networks by comparing their vectors of centred
graphlet counts. Similar to GCD, NetDis has different versions
depending on the size of the graphlets that are used. The current
implementation considers 3- or 4-node graphlets, corresponding
to NetDis-3 and NetDis-4, respectively. Unlike the three other
graphlet-based measures described above, NetDis is parametric,
requiring a gold-standard network, which is its major disadvan-
tage, as we show below.

2.4 Method evaluation and comparison
We systematically evaluate the performance of the network distance
measures by computing how well they can cluster topologically simi-
lar networks generated from the same graph family. We do this by
mimicking the established evaluation approach from Yaverog˘ lu et al.
(2014). That is, we first generate networks from seven graph fami-
lies: Erdo¨ s–Renyi model (ER; Erdos and Re´nyi, 1961), ER degree dis-
tribution preserving model (ERDD; Newman, 2010), scale-free
preferential attachment model (SFBA; Baraba´ si and Albert, 1999),
scale-free gene duplication and divergence model (SFGD; Va´ zquez
et al., 2002), geometric random graph model (GEO; Penrose, 2003),
geometric model with gene duplication (GEOGD; Przˇulj et al., 2010)
and stickiness-index based model (STICKY; Przˇulj and Higham,
2006). The generated networks contain 1000 and 2000 nodes, and
they have edge densities of 0.5% and 1%. We choose these specific
values because the selected sizes and densities are in stable regions of
the graph families (Hayes et al., 2013). To account for randomness
in the network generators, we create 10 networks for each network
size, edge density and graph family combination, producing a total
of 2 (network size)  2 (edge density)  7 (graph families)  10 (net-
work instances) ¼ 280 networks. For graph families that require a
predefined degree distribution, we use networks generated from the
preferential attachment (SF) model.

Given the resulting set of 280 networks, we evaluate the network
clustering performance of a given network distance measure using a
systematic area under precision—recall curve (AUPR) framework.
That is, a given network pair is in the True evaluation set if the two
networks are generated from the same graph family and in the False
set otherwise. For a given distance threshold e, a network pair is
considered as a Positive sample if the distance between the two net-
works is  e and as a Negative sample otherwise. Then, given a set
of network pairs, the Precision-Recall curve is obtained by varying
the distance threshold e and computing the precision and recall for
each e value:

Precision ¼

True Positives

True Positives þ False Positives

;

Recall ¼

True Positives

True Positives þ False Negatives

:

(1)

(2)

AUPR summarizes the quality of the classification illustrated
with the precision-recall curve into a single value, with the max-
imum of 1. AUPR can be interpreted as the probability of obtaining
a True sample when it is randomly drawn from the Positive sample
set at any e threshold. In other words, AUPR represents the average
precision of the given network distance measure. Thus, measures
achieving higher AUPR scores have better performance, i.e. they
more correctly cluster similar networks generated from the same

2700

O¨ .N.Yaverog˘ lu et al.

graph family and separate dissimilar networks generated from dif-
ferent graph families.

To test the effect of network sizes and densities on the perform-
ance of a network distance measure, we compute AUPR scores in
two different ways: (i) we only consider distances between network
pairs that are of the same sizes and densities and (ii) we consider dis-
tances between all network pairs, comparing networks of different
sizes and densities. While the first approach fairly tests how well a
network comparison method distinguishes between different graph
families without the bias of the network sizes and densities, the se-
cond approach should be taken with more caution, as any observed
difference between networks could be due not to the actual differ-
ences in network topologies but differences in network sizes and
densities. A good network distance measure should be able to easily
identify networks generated from the same graph family when the
networks with same sizes and densities are considered. An ideal net-
work distance measure should also be able to identify networks gen-
erated from the same graph family even if their sizes and densities
are different. However, this is a more challenging task for network
distance measures. In both scenarios, we expect a good network dis-
tance measure to produce high AUPR scores.

To compare noise-tolerance performance of different network
distance measures, we repeat the above experiments by rewiring the
edges of the 280 synthetic networks at different rewiring rates;
namely, we rewire 10%; 20%; . . . ; 90% of edges in each of the net-
works. More specifically, for a network that has jEj edges, a ‘k%
noisy network’ is generated as follows: at each step, three nodes, a,
b, c, are chosen randomly with the condition that there is an edge
(a, b), but there is no edge (a, c). Edge (a, b) is removed from the net-
work and edge (a, c) is added into the network. This process is re-
peated ðjEj  kÞ=100 times. Once all of the 280 networks are
randomly rewired as described, we compute AUPR scores of the
new set of rewired networks. To understand the effect of randomiza-
tion, we repeat the rewiring and evaluation process 30 times at each
rewiring rate k. In all these experiments, a successful network dis-
tance measure is expected to produce high average AUPR scores
over the 30 random runs at each threshold.

3 Results and Discussion

We systematically compare the performance of all network distance
measures (Section 2) to correctly position NetDis among other align-
ment-free network comparison methods. We answer the following
questions that the original NetDis study failed to address. What is
the effect of the choice of the gold-standard network (Section 3.1)
and of network sizes and densities (Section 3.2) on the performance
of NetDis? We compare the accuracy (Section 3.3) and computa-
tional running time efficiency (Section 3.4) of NetDis to those of
competing methods. Finally, we argue that the biological application
of NetDis to phylogeny reconstruction, as designed and carried out
in the original study of Ali et al. (2014), is scientifically inaccurate
(Section 3.5).

3.1 NetDis is highly sensitive to the choice of
gold-standard network
NetDis requires a gold-standard network to normalize graphlet
counts in the ego-networks of the compared networks (Section 2.1).
However, for almost all network comparison tasks, there is no prior
information on the structure of the compared networks, and conse-
quently, a well-fitting network null model for these networks is un-
known. Note that one of the purposes of network comparison is to
produce this information as its output rather than using it as input.

The fact that NetDis assumes a specific gold-standard network as its
input and that the same gold-standard network is used for normaliz-
ing the graphlet counts of both of the compared networks (which
might belong to different network null models and thus require
different gold-standard networks) raises serious concerns about the
accuracy of NetDis’s results, as using different gold-standard net-
works can lead to very different results (Artzy-Randrup et al.,
2004). For this reason, NetDis becomes impractical, as its network
clustering performance is highly dependent on the chosen gold-
standard network.

To test the effect of the gold-standard network on the results
of NetDis, we evaluate its performance by using different gold-
standard networks corresponding to different network null models.
Namely, we generate gold-standard networks with 5000 nodes and
20 000 edges [as suggested in the original NetDis paper (Ali et al.,
2014)] from each of the following seven graph families: ER, ERDD,
SFBA, SFGD, GEO, GEOGD and STICKY (Section 2.2). We find
that the AUPR scores of NetDis vary for different gold-standard net-
works with a minimum AUPR difference of 0.25 (Fig. 2A), which
means that the network clustering performance of NetDis is highly
sensitive to the chosen gold-standard network (Fig. 2). Therefore,
the choice on the gold-standard network can have a huge impact on
the quality of the network distances obtained by NetDis.

If NetDis was robust to the choice of gold-standard network, it
should yield qualitatively the same results for all tests performed
using a particular network null model as the gold-standard (Section
2.2). However, this is not the case. In particular, when NetDis uses
the same network null model as the gold-standard, the results of its
clustering of synthetic networks of the same sizes and densities are
not qualitatively the same as the results of clustering of synthetic
networks of different sizes and densities. Namely, when clustering
synthetic networks of different sizes and densities, NetDis returns
the highest AUPR scores when using SFGD network null model as
the gold-standard (Fig. 2A and C). This is true for both NetDis-3
and NetDis-4. However, when clustering synthetic networks of the
same sizes and densities, NetDis returns the highest AUPR scores
when using ERDD or ER network null model as the gold-standard,
depending on NetDis version (Fig. 2B and D). Hence, for the same
NetDis version, different network null models produce qualitatively
the same (the best) results in the two evaluation tests; the evaluation
tests differ only in whether the compared input networks are all of
the same sizes and densities or not. In other words, the same net-
work null model gives qualitatively different results in the two
evaluation tests. This demonstrates that NetDis is highly sensitive to
the choice of a gold-standard network.

3.2 NetDis is affected by network sizes and densities
We argue that Ali et al. (2014) made an incorrect statement that
‘NetDis can correctly separate different random network model
types independent of network size and density.’ Our results do not
support this. When networks of the same sizes and densities are
compared, the highest achieved AUPR score is 0.79 with NetDis-3
(Fig. 2B) and 0.9 with NetDis-4 (Fig. 2D). However, when networks
of different sizes and densities are also included into the computa-
tion, the highest achieved AUPR score is 0.52 for NetDis-3 and 0.59
for NetDis-4. Thus, the performance of NetDis is not independent
of the network sizes and densities.

3.3 GCD is more accurate than NetDis
Also, Ali et al. (2014) did not systematically evaluate the perform-
ance of NetDis to position it correctly among other network

NetDis clusters networks generated from the same graph family, for NetDis versions that use different network null models as gold-standard (i.e. ER, ERDD, SF,
SFGD, GEO, GEOGD and STICKY) and different graphlet sizes (3-node and 4-node graphlets) to deﬁne their network distance measures. ‘NetDis-X-Y ’ denotes the
NetDis version with network null model X and graphlet size Y. The horizontal axis represents different rewiring rates on the synthetic networks and the vertical

with NetDis-4 (NetDis with 4-node graphlets) and (D) clustering only networks of the same sizes and densities with NetDis-4

distance measures in terms of accuracy. NetDis was only compared
to an alignment-based network comparison algorithm called
MI-GRAAL (Kuchaiev and Przˇulj, 2011) and almost all claims
about superiority of NetDis were drawn from that comparison.
However, the purpose of the alignment-based network comparison
problem is very different from the purpose of the alignment-free
methods (Section 1). Thus, it is inaccurate to assess NetDis, an
alignment-free approach,
in comparison to an alignment-based
approach, due to the difference in the goals of the two approach cat-
egories. In addition, a number of newer alignment-based approaches
have been proposed since MI-GRAAL, including GHOST (Patro
and Kingsford, 2012), NETAL (Neyshabur et al., 2013) and
MAGNA (Neyshabur et al., 2013). Hence, even if we accept a com-
parison of alignment-based with non-alignment based methods as a
valid evaluation framework (which it is not), NetDis should have
also been evaluated against the newer and consequently more accur-
ate alignment-based methods. To properly evaluate NetDis, an
alignment-free method, one should compare it to the existing state-
of-the-art alignment-free methods described in Section 2.1.

GCD has been compared with all of the previous alignment-free
methods (Yaverog˘ lu et al., 2014) and it was shown to be superior
when clustering networks generated from the same model. Here, we
include NetDis into this existing comparison framework to properly
assess its performance against the existing approaches. Because
NetDis performs the best with SFGD network null model (Fig. 2),
we give NetDis the best-case advantage by using this network null
model as the gold-standard. We include RGFD, GDDA, GCD-11
and GCD-73 into this comparison as representatives of other meth-
ods based on graphlets (local network properties; Section 2.1). We
also include the best alignment-free method that is based on a global
network property, namely clustering coefficient and exclude the
remaining network distance measures that are already evaluated
in Yaverog˘ lu et al. (2014) and were shown to perform worse
than GCD.

We find that it is GCD (and in particular GCD-11) and not
NetDis that performs the best in all experimental settings (Fig. 3).
GCD-11 is followed by RGFD, GCD-73 and NetDis-4, which have
comparable performance with each other. These are then followed
by the remaining approaches. As expected, the performance of all
methods declines with the increasing levels of noise. However,
GCD-11 still performs the best even when 90% of edges in the input
networks are rewired. The above results are computed when the
best performing network null model (SFGD) is used within NetDis;
any of the other network null models would position NetDis even
further below the other network distance measures (Fig. 2).

In addition, we perform identical experiments on real-world net-
works from different domains rather than on synthetic networks from
different random graph models. Hence, we evaluate the performance
of the methods on real-world network data. We use real-world net-
works from 11 different domains (detailed in the Supplementary
Material). We find that RGFD, NetDis-SFGD-4 and GCD-73 are the
top three methods with the highest AUPR scores, all of comparable
performance (Fig. 4). While NetDis-SFGD-4 has the second highest
AUPR score, both RGFD and GCD-73 have higher precision values
than NetDis-SFGD-4 at all recall values up to 0.6. This means that,
at smaller distance thresholds, both RGFD and GCD-73 identify
more true network pairs than NetDis, which is an important property
for the early classification task. In addition, the above results are com-
puted when using the best performing network null model within
NetDis. When any alternative network null model is used on real-
world networks, NetDis never outperforms any of RGFD and
GCD-73 (see Supplementary Material).

3.4 GCD remains superior to NetDis in terms of
computational efficiency
Typically, global network properties are computationally more effi-
cient to compute than the graphlet-based local properties. However,

Fig. 3. Performance of different alignment-free network distance measures for clustering networks from different graph families. The plots illustrate the AUPR
scores measuring how well different alignment-free network distance measures (i.e. GCD-11, GCD-73, NetDis-SFGD-3, NetDis-SFGD-4, Clustering Coefﬁcient,
RGFD and GDDA) cluster networks from the same graph family. The horizontal axis represents different rewiring rates on the networks and the vertical axis repre-
sents the resulting AUPR scores for these noisy network sets, when: (A) clustering networks of different sizes and densities and (B) clustering only networks of
the same sizes and densities

The computational complexity of NetDis is much higher than
complexities of the other graphlet-based methods, because NetDis
constructs an ego-network of radius two for each of the n nodes
and then counts the graphlets within each ego-network separately,
where different ego-networks overlap. Due to the overlap, graphlet
counting is redundantly done in the same network parts, whereas
the other graphlet-based methods simply account for them only
once. The complexity of obtaining graphlet counts in all ego-
networks is Oðn2dk 1Þ. Once these counts are all obtained, the nor-
malization of
the subgraph counts and the computation of
distances are negligible because their complexities are much lower
than the graphlet counting step. Therefore, the computational
complexity of NetDis-3 and NetDis-4 is Oðn2d2Þ and Oðn2d3Þ, re-
spectively, which makes these measures more expensive than GCD
by an order of O(n).

In addition to the above discussion of theoretical running times
of different methods, we measure empirical running times for
NetDis and GCD. Because the implementation of NetDis computes
NetDis-3 and NetDis-4 distances in the same run, we represent their
running times with a single NetDis measurement. First, we measure
the running times by increasing the number of compared networks
from 10 to 100 to 1000, where the networks are generated by the
preferential attachment model to have 100 nodes and 0.05 edge
density. While, as expected, the required running time increases ex-
ponentially for all measures with the increase in the number of com-
pared networks, GCD is on average 10 times faster than NetDis
(Fig. 5A). Second, we test the effect of the network size on running
times. Here, we generate 10 networks from the preferential attach-
ment model of different sizes, containing 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and
10 000 nodes; for each network size, we use the attachment factor
of 10, which is the number of nodes that an added node is at-
tached to during network construction. While the running time
for GCD is not affected much by the increase in network size, the
running time of NetDis increases exponentially with the increase in
network size. This is because NetDis needs to compute graphlet
counts in each node’s ego-network, so it over-counts graphlets
(Fig. 5B). Finally, to test the effect of network density on running
times, we generate 10 networks from the preferential attachment
model, all containing 1000 nodes, but we vary their density by using
different attachment factors, namely 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100.
Again, while GCD is only slightly affected by network density
increases exponentially
changes,
(Fig. 5C). Thus, GCD is computationally more efficient
than
NetDis, and GCD-11 is the most efficient graphlet-based network
distance measure to date.

Fig. 4. Performance of different alignment-free network distance measures
for clustering of real-world networks. The plot illustrates precision-recall
curves of each alignment-free network distance measure (i.e. GCD-11,
GCD-73, NetDis-SFGD-3, NetDis-SFGD-4, clustering coefﬁcient, RGFD and
GDDA) obtained by clustering real-world networks from different domains.
The corresponding Area Under Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) scores of the
distance measures are provided in the panel to the right

the graphlet-based methods capture the topology of complex net-
works in more detail and thus perform better than the best perform-
ing global network property, the clustering coefficient (Fig. 3). Due
to the high computational complexity of the graphlet counting
process, graphlet-based network comparison methods should be
designed carefully. Given a network with n nodes, the worst case
running time for counting all graphlets and graphlet degrees for 2-
to k-node graphlets is OðnkÞ and a tighter upper-bound is Oðndk 1Þ,
where d  n is the maximum degree over all nodes in the network
(Hocˇevar and Demsˇar, 2014). Because most real-world networks
are sparse, this computational complexity does not affect the applic-
ability of graphlet-based methods to real-world networks. However,
the dependence on the number of nodes in the network should not
be ignored; because real-world networks tend to contain thousands
to millions of nodes.

Earlier methods that use graphlet properties (i.e. RGFD, GDDA
and GCD) are computationally easier to compute after one has al-
ready obtained the graphlet counts and GDVs of all nodes in the
given networks. Once these counts are computed, the remaining
steps of RGFD, GDDA, and GCD computation require low compu-
tational times of O(1), O(n), and OðnlnðnÞÞ, respectively (Yaverog˘ lu
et al., 2014). Therefore, their computational bottlenecks lie in the
step of producing the graphlet counts, which takes Oðndk 1Þ (see
above). Importantly, since GCD-11 requires counting only 2- to
4-node graphlets, its computational complexity is significantly lower
than complexities of graphlet-based measures that rely on larger
graphlets, corresponding to Oðnd3Þ.

3.5 Application of NetDis to phylogeny reconstruction is
inaccurate
As a potential application of NetDis, Ali et al. (2014) compare the
protein–protein interaction networks of five species (Helicobacter
pylori, Escherichia coli, fly, human and yeast). Then, they recon-
struct the phylogenetic tree of these species by applying average link-
age hierarchical clustering on the resulting NetDis distances. We
show that this is not a valid evaluation strategy for NetDis (see
Supplementary Material for details) because: (i) protein–protein
interaction networks are incomplete, which makes the alignment-
free comparisons extremely biased, (ii) NetDis produces different
hierarchical trees for different parameters (i.e. the number of used
graphlets and the gold-standard network) and the reconstructed
phylogenetic tree in Ali et al. (2014) is a cherry-picked case out of
many possible outcomes, (iii) the same phylogenetic tree cannot be
reproduced with protein–protein interaction networks that are ob-
tained from different data sources (e.g. BioGRID), (iv) similar phylo-
genetic trees can be partially reproduced by using very simple
network properties such as network density and (v) using five net-
works only for this purpose might not give enough statistical power
to properly evaluate significance of the resulting tree.

4 Conclusion

We systematically, comprehensively and fairly compare available
alignment-free network comparison methods, positioning NetDis
correctly among other existing approaches. We observe that NetDis,
the newest graphlet-based approach for comparing networks, does
not perform as well as GCD in clustering networks with similar top-
ologies and it is also computationally more expensive than previous
graphlet-based approaches. Furthermore, NetDis is highly sensitive
to the choice on the gold-standard network that it uses and this
makes it impractical. This is because a well-fitting network null
model is hard to determine and differs for most real-world networks
and therefore, it is not possible to choose a theoretically well-
founded gold-standard network for NetDis comparison of real-
world networks, especially because each of the compared networks
might require a different gold-standard network. Hence, GCD is still
the best performing alignment-free network comparison method to
date, which is also highly efficient and not dependent on any net-
work null models. These make GCD a natural choice in alignment-
free network comparison.
