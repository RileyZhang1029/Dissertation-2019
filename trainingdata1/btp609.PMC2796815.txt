ABSTRACT
Motivation: Prochlorococcus possesses the smallest genome of
all sequenced photoautotrophs. Although the number of regulatory
proteins in the genome is very small, the relative number of small
regulatory RNAs is comparable with that of other bacteria. The
compact genome size of Prochlorococcus offers an ideal system to
search for targets of small RNAs (sRNAs) and to reﬁne existing target
prediction algorithms.
Results: Target predictions for
the cyanobacterial sRNA Yfr1
were carried out with INTARNA in Prochlorococcus MED4. The
ultraconserved Yfr1 sequence motif was deﬁned as the putative
interaction seed. To study the impact of Yfr1 on its predicted mRNA
targets, a reporter system based on green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
was applied. We show that Yfr1 inhibits the translation of two
predicted targets. We used mutation analysis to conﬁrm that Yfr1
directly regulates its targets by an antisense interaction sequestering
the ribosome binding site, and to assess the importance of
interaction site accessibility.

1 INTRODUCTION
Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are regulatory RNAs that often
act as post-transcriptional regulators by base pairing to trans-
encoded target mRNAs. The sRNA–mRNA interaction can result
in translational repression and/or mRNA degradation, as well
as
translational activation, mostly in response to changing
environmental conditions (Waters and Storz, 2009). The few sRNA–
mRNA interactions experimentally characterized so far have been
particularly studied in the two model organisms Escherichia coli
(E.coli) and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (Salmonella) (Gottesman,
2005; Vogel, 2009).

However, sRNA regulators are not restricted to model bacteria,
but occur ubiquitously in bacteria. In this study, we investigated

the
cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus.
This photoautotrophically dwelling organism often accounts for up
to 50% of the organic biomass in the oligotrophic areas of the open
oceans, and is thus a crucial component of the food web (Goericke
and Welschmeyer, 1993; Vaulot et al., 1995). A recent systematic
survey of sRNAs in Prochlorococcus MED4 revealed a large number
of potential regulatory RNAs comparable with those found in other
bacteria (Steglich et al., 2008). This ﬁnding was very surprising, as
Prochlorococcus has experienced an evolutionary streamlining of
its genome, leading to very compact genomes between 1.64 and
2.68 Mb, which notably results in a small number of regulatory
proteins (Kettler et al., 2007). The identiﬁcation of sRNA targets
in Prochlorococcus constitutes a big challenge, since common
experimental approaches such as knockouts of these sRNAs cannot
be applied. Instead, the only possible approach is a combination
of in silico target prediction, followed by in vivo experimental
validation (in a heterologous expression system).

An interesting sRNA candidate to study is Yfr1, which is
an abundant RNA with ubiquitous appearance in all lineages of
cyanobacteria except for two Prochlorococcus strains (Voss et al.,
2007). Recent studies have shown that Yfr1 is constitutively
expressed and accumulates up to 18 000 copies per cell
in
Synechococcus elangatus PCC6301 (Nakamura et al., 2007). The
high copy numbers of Yfr1 raise the question of whether this
RNA acts as a trans-encoded sRNA through base pairing with its
targets, or whether it modulates protein activity. An example of such
modulation activity is the 6S RNA, which downregulates mRNA
transcription by mimicking an open promoter complex (Wassarman,
2007). However, a prominent feature of Yfr1 is the ultraconserved
11 nt long sequence motif located in an unpaired sequence stretch
ﬂanked by two stem–loops (Fig. 1A). Similar to Yfr1, the two
Salmonella sRNAs GcvB and RybB show a conserved single-
stranded region. In both the GcvB and RybB sRNAs, these regions
are involved in the binding of multiple targets, which results
in reduced translation of the targets (Vogel, 2009). To verify
whether Yfr1 analogously regulates trans-encoded mRNAs via
base pairing, we predicted putative interaction partners of Yfr1
in the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 and experimentally
validated these candidates by a reporter system based on green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP).

2 METHODS
2.1 Computational prediction of Yfr1 targets
For the target prediction, a 400 nt subsequence including 250 nt upstream
and 150 nt downstream of the start codon was extracted for all annotated
genes of the Prochlorococcus MED4 genome [GenBank accession number
BX548174 (Rocap et al., 2003) using the updated annotation by Kettler et al.
(2007)]. In total, we obtained 1964 sequences covering the full 5
untranslated
UTR) (if not >250 nt) and the beginning of the coding sequence
region (5
of each gene to search for interactions with Yfr1.

Putative interactions with Yfr1 were predicted with IntaRNA based
on hybridization energy and accessibility of the interaction sites (Busch
et al., 2008). The IntaRNA approach also incorporates interaction seeds,
i.e. short regions of (nearly) perfect sequence complementarity. Accessibility
is deﬁned as the energy required to unfold the region of interaction in each
molecule. In the calculation of these unfolding energies, we assumed global
folding of Yfr1. In contrast, the mRNA does not fold globally due to helicase
activity of the ribosome (Takyar et al., 2005). Hence, the mRNA subsequence
was locally folded in a 200 nt window with a maximal base pair distance of
100 nt. For each gene, the optimal interaction and up to ﬁve suboptimal
interactions were computed.

In Prochlorococcus MED4, the ultraconserved motif 5
(cid:2)

-ACUCCUCACA-
covers positions 17–27 of Yfr1 RNA (Fig. 1A). This motif was predicted
C-3
to be single-stranded in the consensus secondary structure of Yfr1 orthologs
from 31 cyanobacteria (Voss et al., 2007). In order to search for interactions
with this motif as seed region, we extended the IntaRNA program by adding
optional constraints that allow to ﬁx the seed position to a given interval of
the sRNA sequence. For the target search, we deﬁned an interaction seed of
eight paired bases and at most one unpaired base within the aforementioned
conserved Yfr1 motif (IntaRNA parameters -p 8 -u 1 -f 17,27). To investigate
the inﬂuence of interaction seeds, the target prediction was additionally
conducted without requiring a seed region (IntaRNA parameter -p 2 for
at least 2 bp).

(cid:2)

We also tested a modiﬁed energy score that weights the accessibility

against the hybridization energy with factor α:

E= Ehybrid+αEDmRNA+αEDsRNA,

where Ehybrid denotes the hybridization energy of the interaction and EDx
denotes the energy required to make the interaction site accessible in
sequence x. The original IntaRNA scoring does not weight the unfolding
energy of the interaction sites, i.e. α=1.

In addition to the IntaRNA energy score, the location of the interaction in
the mRNA is used as a further criterion to evaluate the quality of prediction.
The majority of characterized trans-encoded sRNAs downregulate their

targets by base pairing to the 5
binding site (RBS) (reviewed in Aiba, 2007). Therefore, the predicted target
candidates were ﬁltered for interactions that involve the mRNA region from
−39 to +19 relative to the start codon, which is the maximal region covered
by ribosomes (Hüttenhofer and Noller, 1994).

2.2 Experimental validation of Yfr1 targets
2.2.1 E.coli growth conditions and plasmid constructions E.coli strain
Top10F
was used for cloning of all target-gfp fusions in plasmid pXG-10 or
of Yfr1 gene in plasmid pZE12-luc. All interaction studies were carried out in
C
E.coli strain Top10. E.coli cells were grown in Luria–Bertani broth at 37
in the presence of 100 µg/ml ampicillin and/or 25 µg/ml chloramphenicol.
Plasmids used in this work were obtained from Dr Jörg Vogel (MPI, Berlin).
Plasmid constructions of the respective 5
UTRs and of Yfr1 are described in
UTRs and the ﬁrst
detail in Urban and Vogel (2007). In brief, full-length 5
coding residues of the targets of interest were ligated in pXG-10 plasmid
using two complementary oligonucleotides with an Mph1103I restriction
site at the 5
terminus, which
UTR
were annealed to each other prior to ligation. In the case of the 5
of PMM0494, a PCR-generated fragment (containing an Mph1103I and an
NheI restriction site) was digested and ligated into Mph1103I- and NheI-
digested pXG-10 plasmid. The Yfr1 gene was ampliﬁed by PCR containing
an XbaI restriction site and ligated in pZE12-luc plasmid containing an
XbaI restriction site for insertion. Yfr1 mutants (Yfr1 M1: CC at positions
20 and 21 substituted by GG leading to the formation of a stem–loop
structure in the normally unpaired region, Yfr1 M2: UCCU at positions 19–
22 substituted by AAAA without changing the structure, see Figure 1) were
generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides containing an
XbaI restriction site. The complete list of oligonucleotides used for cloning

2.2.2 Analysis of Yfr1-mediated target regulation We tested potential
interactions of Yfr1 sRNA with the 5
UTRs of the putative targets PMM0050
(argJ, bifunctional ornithine acetyltransferase/N-acetylglutamate synthase),
PMM0494 (ppa, putative inorganic pyrophosphatase), PMM0538 (unknown
function), PMM1119 (som, outer membrane protein), PMM1121 (som,
outer membrane protein) or PMM1697 (type II alternative σ factor). For
ﬂuorescence measurement, overnight cultures were grown in 96-well plates
(Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 37
C with gentle agitation in an air humidity
saturated environment to prevent evaporation. Cells were diluted 1:100,
ﬁxed in 1% Histoﬁx (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and kept in darkness until
measurements were conducted. Single cell ﬂuorescence was determined by
ﬂow cytometry with the ﬂow cytometer LSR II (BD Bioscience, New Jersey,
USA). Cell ﬂuorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of
488nm and the emission was detected at 513/17nm. Target-gfp fusions
as well as control plasmids pXG-0 (negative control) and pXG-1 (positive
control) were tested in the presence of a nonsense RNA and Yfr1 sRNA,
respectively. The mean ﬂuorescence per plasmid combination was calculated
from 10 000 events (cells) of six individual clones.

shown in Figure 2. Two of the six tested target candidates are
translationally repressed by Yfr1, as shown by a reduced GFP
ﬂuorescence signal (Fig. 3). The ﬁrst clusters of the bar chart in
Figure 3 constitute the negative controls (E.coli strain Top10 without
plasmid or with plasmid pXG-0 devoid of gfp, respectively) and the
positive control (E.coli strain Top10 with plasmid pXG-1 carrying
gfp). The remaining clusters represent the 5
UTR-gfp fusions for
the targets of interest. Each gfp fusion plasmid was tested in the
presence of a second plasmid containing a nonsense RNA (white
bars), Yfr1 sRNA (red bars) and the two mutated Yfr1 sRNAs M1
and M2 (light and dark blue bars) (Fig. 3).
In the presence of the nonsense RNA, no regulation of the
(cid:2)
5
UTR-gfp fusions by an interaction is expected (Fig. 3, white bars),
and the ﬂuorescence measured here represents the 5
UTR-speciﬁc
translation efﬁciency. The different GFP ﬂuorescence intensities can
be explained by differences in the afﬁnities of the ribosomes for
the translation initiation region. The strongest inhibition by Yfr1
was detected for the 5
UTRs of the two som genes PMM1119 and
PMM1121 (3.0- and 2.7-fold reduced GFP signal, red bars in Fig. 3).
No change in GFP ﬂuorescence was observed for PMM1697 and
PMM0538 5
UTRs in the presence of Yfr1. For PMM0494 and
PMM0050, no ﬂuorescence above the background level (dashed
line in Fig. 3) could be detected for any tested plasmid combination.
Translation inhibition of the two soms was abolished by the
introduction of a mutation in the conserved Yfr1 motif exchanging
CC by GG (Yfr1 M1,
light blue bars in Fig. 3). These two
substitutions involve the region predicted to base pair with the
RBS of the two som mRNAs. Furthermore, mutation M1 led to a
structural change by introducing a stem–loop in the single-stranded
region of wild-type Yfr1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, mutation M1 results
in both a sequential and structural change at the interaction site.
To test whether the destruction of the antisense complementarity
alone (without structural change) abolishes regulation by Yfr1,
we constructed another Yfr1 mutant. In the Yfr1 mutant M2,
nucleotides UCCU were substituted by AAAA without changing the
secondary structure of wild-type Yfr1 (Fig. 1A). Again, translation
of PMM1119 and PMM1121 was restored (Fig. 3, dark blue bars).
These results indicate that Yfr1 inhibits translation of the two som

mRNAs by direct base pairing at the RBS. Furthermore, the results
strongly indicate that both sequence and structure are important for
Yfr1 regulation.

Surprisingly, we also observed a 1.5-fold reduction in GFP
ﬂuorescence for the positive control pXG-1 in the presence of Yfr1
and restored translation under the control of Yfr1 M1 and M2.
However, the strong RBS in the 5
UTR of gfp in pXG-1 (Urban
and Vogel, 2007) shows a perfect complementarity to part of the
conserved Yfr1 motif. Thus, Yfr1 can form a perfect 6 nt duplex
with the 5
UTR (Fig. 2), which can explain the observation of a
reduction in translation.

Inﬂuence of seed requirement and accessibility on
Yfr1 target prediction

The prediction of sRNA targets with IntaRNA is based on two
assumptions: (i) a seed region is required to initiate the interaction
(cid:2)
[in analogy to the 5
seed region of miRNAs (Bartel, 2009)]
and (ii) the accessibility of the interaction sites is important for
target recognition. A previous study on a dataset of 18 different
sRNA–mRNA interactions presented evidence that the incorporation

with the ﬁndings of Tjaden et al. (2006) and Busch et al. (2008),
who showed that an energy model based solely on hybridization
energy tends to maximize the length of hybridization, resulting in
a small fraction of correctly predicted base pairs (i.e. low positive
predictive value).

Fig. 3. Experimental validation of Yfr1 target predictions. The relative
decrease in GFP ﬂuorescence as determined by ﬂow cytometry indicates
the strength of Yfr1-mediated regulation. The dashed line indicates
background ﬂuorescence (i.e. cellular autoﬂuorescence), determined as the
mean GFP signal of the negative controls. Fold changes of reduced GFP
signal for PMM1119 (3.0-fold), PMM1121 (2.7-fold) and pXG1 (1.5-fold)
were calculated after background subtraction from absolute ﬂuorescence
values (Urban and Vogel, 2007).

of these two requirements improves the prediction quality of
IntaRNA (Busch et al., 2008). Here, we investigated the importance
of accessibility and of a seed region in a practical application, namely
the identiﬁcation of new targets for the Yfr1 sRNA.

Therefore, we computed lists of putative targets without enforcing
a seed region and with enforcing a seed at the conserved Yfr1
motif. When requiring the ﬁxed seed position, we obtained a short
list of only 29 target candidates with the experimentally validated
Yfr1 targets PMM1119 and PMM1121 ranked at positions 1
and 3, respectively (Table 1). Without
the seed requirement,
1418 target candidates were obtained with the two true positives
ranked at positions 1 and 4. Even without using a seed constraint,
the interactions predicted for
the true positives include the
conserved single-stranded region of Yfr1. Thus, the combination
of complementarity and accessibility alone resulted in interactions
with an implicit seed.

In addition to the effect of a seed requirement, we studied the
inﬂuence of accessibility on the Yfr1 target prediction. In the
original IntaRNA scoring, hybridization energy and interaction site
accessibilities contribute equally to the energy score. Here, we tested
a modiﬁed energy score, where the interaction site accessibility of
both sequences was weighted by factor α with the values 0, 0.5 and 1.
For both seed requirements studied, the true positives PMM1119 and
PMM1121 were ranked best with the original scoring (Table 1).
One interesting observation was that in the case of Yfr1, a full
weighting of the interaction site accessibility, i.e. α=1, was required
for a correct target site prediction. When both the seed region and
accessibility were neglected, the two veriﬁed Yfr1 targets were not
found within the top 150 predictions. When the seed position was
ﬁxed to the conserved region but accessibility was not included in
the scoring, the validated targets were ranked at positions 22 and 32.
However, in this case, predicted interactions involved almost the
entire Yfr1 sequence (data not shown). This observation is consistent

4 CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we show that Yfr1 sRNA modulates the translation
of two high-scoring predicted targets by an antisense interaction.
Both target mRNAs code for outer membrane proteins (Hansel et al.,
1998). This class of proteins constitutes a major functional class that
is regulated by bacterial sRNAs in E.coli and Salmonella (Waters
and Storz, 2009). The result was surprising as, until now, no highly
abundant sRNAs have been shown to act via base pair interaction.
However, both mRNA targets identiﬁed herein are also highly
abundant [among the 10 most expressed mRNAs and with long
half-lives of about 30 min (C.Steglich, unpublished data)], which
may require a high copy number of Yfr1 for efﬁcient regulation.
Furthermore, an mRNA with a long half-life can be regulated more
efﬁciently by translational control than by transcriptional control.

Additionally, we assessed the inﬂuence of seed regions and
interaction site accessibility on the prediction quality of Yfr1 targets.
As with the Salmonella sRNAs GcvB and RybB, Yfr1 contains
a conserved single-stranded region, which seems to constitute a
perfect interaction seed. When requiring this region as seed for the
target prediction, the number of putative Yfr1 targets was remarkably
smaller without seed requirement (29 versus 1418 candidates),
although the two true positives were under the highest ranking
candidates in both settings. When neglecting both accessibility and
a seed region, the true Yfr1 targets could not be found amongst the
top 150 predictions.

In conclusion, the combination of computational and experi-
mental methods, as presented in this study, proved to be an
appropriate approach for the identiﬁcation of sRNA targets in
organisms where genetic manipulation constitutes a great challenge.
