ABSTRACT
Motivation: Survival prediction of breast cancer
(BC) patients
independently of treatment, also known as prognostication, is a
complex task since clinically similar breast tumors, in addition to be
molecularly heterogeneous, may exhibit different clinical outcomes.
In recent years, the analysis of gene expression proﬁles by means of
sophisticated data mining tools emerged as a promising technology
to bring additional insights into BC biology and to improve the quality
of prognostication. The aim of this work is to assess quantitatively the
accuracy of prediction obtained with state-of-the-art data analysis
techniques for BC microarray data through an independent and
thorough framework.
Results: Due to the large number of variables, the reduced amount of
samples and the high degree of noise, complex prediction methods
are highly exposed to performance degradation despite the use
of cross-validation techniques. Our analysis shows that the most
complex methods are not signiﬁcantly better than the simplest one,
a univariate model relying on a single proliferation gene. This result
suggests that proliferation might be the most relevant biological
process for BC prognostication and that the loss of interpretability
deriving from the use of overcomplex methods may be not sufﬁciently
counterbalanced by an improvement of the quality of prediction.

called survcomp and is available from http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/

1 INTRODUCTION

During the last
indicators such as histological grade,
tumor size and lymph
node involvement have been used for the survival prediction
of breast cancer (BC) patients independently of treatment, also
known as prognostication. Examples of clinical guidelines to
the selection of patients who should receive adjuvant therapy are

guidelines (Eifel et al., 2001), the Nottingham prognostic index
(NPI, Galea et al., 1992) and Adjuvant! Online (AOL, Olivotto
et al., 2005). Although BC prognostication has been the object of
intense research, a still open challenge is how to detect patients who
needs adjuvant systemic therapy.

The advent of array-based technology and the sequencing of the
human genome brought new insights into breast cancer biology
and prognosis. Interestingly, several research teams conducted
comprehensive genome-wide assessments of gene expression
proﬁling and identiﬁed prognostic gene expression signatures.
Examples of gene signatures which were obtained by studying
the relationship between gene expression proﬁles and clinical
outcome, are the 70-gene (van’t Veer et al., 2002) and 76-gene
(Wang et al., 2005) signatures. With respect to clinical guidelines,
these signatures were shown to correctly identify a larger group
of low-risk patients not requiring treatment. This is particularly
relevant for clinicians, since reducing treatments means also
reducing potential side effects and cutting costs. Another example
of gene signature is reported in Sotiriou et al. (2006b). This study
is focused on histological grade, a well-established pathological
indicator rooted in the cell biology of breast cancer. In fact,
clinicians encounter problems when confronted with patients with
intermediate-grade tumors (Grade 2). These tumors, which represent
30–60% of cases, are a major source of inter-observer discrepancy
and may display intermediate phenotype and survival, making
treatment decisions for these patients a great challenge, with
subsequent under- or over-treatment. By means of a supervised
analysis, the authors developed a gene expression grade index
based on 128 probes. The associated genes were mainly involved
in cell-cycle regulation and proliferation and were consistently
differentially expressed between low- and high-grade breast
carcinomas. This signature, which essentially quantiﬁes the degree
of similarity between the tumor expression pattern of these genes
and the tumor grade, was able to separate patients labeled with
histological Grade 2 tumors into two groups having distinct
clinical outcomes similar to those of histological Grades 1 and 3,
respectively.

Other research groups have proposed gene expression signatures
that are predictive of
the clinical outcome in breast cancer
[see Sotiriou and Piccart (2007) for a review]. However, since
different risk prediction methods, different accuracy measures and

different validation sets were used, it is not easy to compare their
performance in terms of BC prognostication.

The purpose of this work is 2-fold: ﬁrst set up a common and
independent assessment framework to compare the performance of
existing gene signatures and several state-of-the-art risk prediction
methods; second, compare the prediction accuracy of these methods
in several BC microarray prognostication tasks to elucidate the key
characteristics of a successful risk prediction method and to bring
additional insights into BC biology.

Every risk prediction model aims to assign risk values or
survival probabilities to patients on the basis of the information
that
the time of diagnosis. This is known to
be a difﬁcult task because of several issues speciﬁc to survival
microarray data. First of all, censored information cannot be
exploited by traditional supervised classiﬁcation and regression
methods, but demands the adoption of speciﬁc survival analysis
techniques, like the semi-parametric Cox’s proportional hazards
model (Cox, 1972). A second issue is the high dimensionality
of microarray data. When the number of explanatory variables
exceeds by far the number of patients in the sample cohort
(high feature-to-sample ratio), overﬁtting of naively applied data
mining methods and overoptimistic performance assessment lie
in wait. At the same time, it is very difﬁcult to select the most
relevant variables for prediction, because of their interdependency
and the reduced power of the statistical
inference procedure
for high feature-to-sample ratio datasets (Bontempi, 2007). As
a consequence, it is common to select variables that ﬁt nicely
the training set and fail dramatically on independent validation
sets, thus leading to unstable gene signatures (Ein-Dor et al.,
2005; Michiels et al., 2005) and poor prediction models. A third
issue is the lack of standards in performance assessment for risk
prediction models. Indeed, there exist few accuracy measures for
risk prediction, and, to the best of our knowledge, no articles
studied their agreement on the same set of methods and datasets.
Lastly,
the validation and the comparison of BC microarray
prognostication methods are made difﬁcult due to the lack of
independent data.

In this work, we compare the performance of 13 risk prediction
methods on more than 1000 patients. This is made possible thanks to
the recent publications of several large microarray datasets in gene
expression databases, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,
Barrett et al., 2005) An important outcome of the analysis is that, in
spite of the large number of samples, there is no statistical evidence
that complex methods outperform the simplest BC prognostication
techniques. This result suggests that the loss of interpretability
deriving from the use of overcomplex data analysis strategies may
not be sufﬁciently counterbalanced by an improvement in the quality
of prediction.

Finally, it is worth to mention that the present article complies
with the research reproducibility guidelines proposed in Gentleman
(2005) in terms of availability of the code and reproducibility of
results and ﬁgures.1 A list of acronyms used throughout the article
is given in Supplementary Table 1.

A single gene for breast cancer prognostication?

2 METHODS
2.1 Notations for survival analysis
Throughout the article we will adopt the following notation: upper case
and lower case letters represent random variables and their realization,
respectively, while bold letters denote vectors or matrices. Let us denote
the time as t. We suppose that a sample cohort of n patients is available
and that for each patient we observed a p-dimensional vector of covariates
xi with 1≤ i≤ n at the time of diagnosis t=0, as well as the evolution of the
survival status. Since we limit our study to microarray data, the covariate xi
denotes the expression of the whole genome of the i-th patient. Survival data
for the i-th patient are denoted as follows: ti stands for the event time, ci for
the censoring time and δi for the censoring indicator (δi =1 if ti ≤ ci and δi =0
if ti > ci). We introduce the counting process di(t)=1 if ti ≤ t and di(t)=0
if ti > t to denote survival status at any time t where di(t)=1 indicates that
patient i experienced an event prior to time t.

2.2 Risk prediction methods
The aim of a risk prediction model is to predict future survival status for all
patients in the cohort. All the risk prediction models considered in this study
return a risk score denoted by R, that is a continuous value which quantiﬁes
the risk of a patient to experience an event. Clinicians often use the risk
score to derive risk groups, denoted by G, on the basis of quantiles of the
risk score distribution. Although the discretization of individual risk scores
into a ﬁnite (and often small) set of risk groups may introduce bias (Gerds
and Schumacher, 2001), this approach is very intuitive and conforms to the
daily doctors’ decision making process, e.g. the attribution of either low or
high risk to patients. In the following, the quantity ri and gi will denote the
risk score and the risk group for patient i, respectively. G is either 0 or 1 for
a low- or high-risk patient, respectively.

In this experimental study, we decided to focus on a set of 13 state-
of-the-art methods (summarized in Table 1) with the ambition of being
representative of a large number of risk prediction strategies. The ﬁrst risk
prediction method is also the simplest one and deﬁnes the risk score as the
expression of a single proliferation gene (AURKA) well studied in literature
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). The following 10 methods (from 2 to 11) are
characterized by the type of observed genotype (input data), the dimension
reduction strategy, the structure of the model, the learning algorithm and the
predicted phenotype (outcome variable).
Genotype: it can be the expression of a single proliferation gene (AURKA),
the expression of a biologically driven selection of genes of interest (BD)
or the expression of the whole genome (GW). AURKA and the small set
of genes in BD were selected to represent several biological processes
in BC (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). The selected genes were AURKA
(also known as STK6, 7 or 15), PLAU (also known as uPA), STAT1,
VEGF, CASP3, ESR1 and ERBB2, representing the proliferation, tumor
invasion/metastasis, immune response, angiogenesis, apoptosis phenotypes
and the ER and HER2 signaling, respectively.
Dimension reduction strategy: we use either a simple univariate ranking
(RANK) of the k most relevant features or a selection of the ﬁrst k
principal components (PCA). Univariate ranking uses Wilcoxon rank sum
test (Wilcoxon, 1945) in the case of binary outcome or Cox’s proportional
hazards model (Cox, 1972) in the case of survival outcome. The signature
size k is either ﬁxed or tuned by cross-validation (CV) as described in
Section 2.2.1. It is worth to note that no dimension reduction was performed
for BD input data due to the low dimensionality of the input space.
Structure of the model: we adopt either a multivariate (MULTIV) model
or a linear combination of univariate models (COMBUNIV), particularly
interesting in a high-dimensional setting (Haibe-Kains et al., 2008; Kittler
et al., 1998).
Learning algorithm: we consider four types of learning algorithms: (i)
the linear combination of gene expressions weighted by the signiﬁcance
computed from the Wilcoxon rank sum test (WILCOXON) that allowed
for identifying the most relevant genes to discriminate the patients with

the signiﬁcance computed from the univariate Cox’s proportional hazards
model (COX) and (iv) the multivariate Cox’s model with L1 regularization
(RCOX) as implemented in Park and Hastie (2007).
Phenotype: we use three different phenotypical informations to ﬁt the
prediction models: (i) the binary class deﬁned by histological grades 1
and 3 (HG), (ii) the censored survival data (SURV) and (iii) the time of
events (TOE), i.e. the times from diagnosis until the patients experienced
an event. In the following, we will denote each of the 10 models with
a unique label obtained by concatenating the acronyms referring to its
characteristics (Table 1). For instance, BD.COMBUNIV.COX.SURV refers
to a combination of univariate Cox’s proportional hazards models ﬁtted from
a biologically driven selection of genes.

The last

two models taken into consideration are the published
GENE76 (Wang et al., 2005) and GGI (Sotiriou et al., 2006b) models.
The GENE76 model is deﬁned as a hierarchical model using two linear
combinations of the top gene expressions with respect to a ranking based on
Cox’s proportional hazards model. The choice of the linear combination to
compute the risk score depends on the estrogen receptor status of the patient.
The GGI model consists of a linear combination of the expressions of the
top probes ranked according to their standardized mean difference (Hedges
and Olkin, 1987) between patients with histological grades 1 and 3 tumors.
The weights of the linear combination are simply the signs of the ranking
statistics.

2.2.1 Tuning of hyperparameters The GGI and GENE76 models did not
require any tuning of hyperparameters since they were fully deﬁned in
previous publications. Only the models based on dimension reduction and
regularization required the tuning of an hyperparameter. For GW models,
a simple ranking or a principal components analysis was used to select
the k most relevant features. The hyperparameter k was either set to 30,
this signature size being reported as a good trade-off between relevance
and model complexity in the comparison study of Dudoit et al. (2002),
or tuned using a 5-fold CV procedure (see Section 1 in Supplementary
Material). The dimension reduction strategies using the latter procedure
are referred as RANKCV and PCACV for the univariate ranking and the
principal component analysis, respectively. For methods using RCOX as
learning algorithm, the hyperparameter for the penalty term was tuned by
using a 5-fold CV as in Park and Hastie (2007).

2.3 Performance assessment
In order to assess the performance of the risk prediction methods, we used
ﬁve accuracy measures: the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve (Heagerty et al., 2000), the sensitivity and speciﬁcity, the
concordance index (Harrell et al., 1996), the Brier score (Brier, 1950; Graf
et al., 1999) and the traditional hazard ratio (HR) from Cox’s proportional
hazards model (Cox, 1972).

2.3.1 Time-dependent ROC Curve The ROC curve is a standard technique
for assessing the performance of a continuous variable for binary
classiﬁcation (Sweets, 1988). A ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity versus
1−speciﬁcity for all the possible cutoff values of the continuous variable,
denoted by c. In survival analysis, the continuous variable is the risk score,
denoted by R, and the binary class to predict is the event occurrence, denoted
by D(t). As the event occurrence is time-dependent, time-dependent ROC
curves are more appropriate than conventional ones. In Heagerty et al.
(2000), the authors proposed to summarize the discrimination potential of a
risk score R, estimated at the diagnosis time t=0, by calculating ROC curves
for cumulative event occurrence by time t. Once we deﬁne the sensitivity
SE and the speciﬁcity SP as follows

SE(c,t,r) = Pr{r > c|d(t)=1}
SP(c,t,r) = Pr{r≤ c|d(t)=0}

(1)

(2)
the ROC curve ROC(t) at time t is the plot of SE(c,t,r) versus 1−SP(c,t,r),
where the cutoff point c is the parameter. In order to estimate the conditional
probabilities in (1) and (2), accounting for possible censoring, we used the
nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function proposed
by Akritas (1994).

From the ROC curve ROC(t) we can derive the area under the curve
(AUC) quantity, denoted by AUC(t). Since AUC depends on time t, we deﬁne
the integrated area under the curve (IAUC) as the area under AUC(t),∀t∈
T. Note that, in this study, the larger the AUC at time t, the better is the
predictability of time to event (TTE) at time t. Similarly, the larger IAUC,
the better is the average predictability of TTE.

2.3.2 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity A widely used performance criterion for a
clinical test is the pair {sensitivity, speciﬁcity} (Simon, 2005). However, the
calculation of these values from survival data requires estimators accounting
for TTE and possible censoring. We used the estimators deﬁned in (1) and
(2) for sensitivity and speciﬁcity, respectively. For risk score prediction, we
estimated the speciﬁcity for a sensitivity of 90% in accordance with the St
Gallen (Goldhirsh et al., 2003) and National Institutes of Health (Eifel et al.,
2001) treatment guidelines. For risk group prediction, we estimated both the
sensitivity and the speciﬁcity of the binary classiﬁcation returned by all the
methods. Note that the larger the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity, the better is
the predictability of TTE.

2.3.3 Concordance index The concordance index (C-index) computes
the probability that, for a pair of randomly chosen comparable patients, the
patient with the higher risk prediction will experience an event before
the lower risk patient. The C-index takes the form

C-index=

(cid:1)

i,j∈ 1{ri > rj}

||

(3)

where ri and rj stand for the risk predictions of the i-th and the j-th patient,
respectively, and  is the set of all the pairs of patients {i,j} who meet one of
the following conditions: (i) both patients i and j experienced an event and
time ti < tj or (ii) only patient i experienced an event and ti < cj. In the case
of risk group prediction, an additional condition must be met, that is the risk
predictions are different for patients i and j (no ties in r).

Note that the C-index is a generalization of the AUC(t), though it is unable
to represent the evolution of performance with respect to time (Harrell et al.,
1996).

Standard errors, conﬁdence intervals and P-values for the C-index are
computed by assuming asymptotic normality (Pencina and D’Agostinno,
2004). Note that,
the better is the
predictability of TTE.

the larger C-index,

in this study,

2.3.4 Brier score The Brier score, denoted by BSC,
is deﬁned as
the squared difference between an event occurrence and its predicted
probabilities at time t. Probabilities of event, denoted by Q, can be derived
from Cox’s proportional hazards model ﬁtted with the risk score R or risk
group G predictions. Intuitively, if a patient experiences no event at time t,
the event predicted probability should be close to zero. Symmetrically, if the
patient experiences an event the probability should be close to one. The BSC
formalizes this intuition by computing the time dependent quantity

BSC(t,q)= n(cid:2)
i=1

(di(t)−qi(t))2W

(4)

where the weights W are used to remove a large sample censoring bias (Gerds
and Schumacher, 2006; Graf et al., 1999).

A summary of the predictability error over times is returned by the
integrated Brier score, denoted by IBSC. Note that the lower the BSC, the
better is the predictability of TTE at time t. Similarly, the lower the IBSC,
the better is the average predictability of TTE.

For judging the (I)BSC, we will rely on the score of a benchmark risk
prediction model which is obtained with the overall Kaplan–Meier estimator
(Kaplan and Meier, 1958) for the survival function (this model is called
KM in further sections). This simple risk prediction model corresponds to a
model which assigns the same risk prediction to all patients. It ignores the
information contained in explanatory variables completely and thus provides
a suitable benchmark value similar as the one obtained with the null model
in linear regression.

In this work we used the HR as an accuracy measure
2.3.5 Hazard ratio
for the risk group prediction in order to keep it interpretable and comparable
between different risk prediction methods as the scale of predictions is well
deﬁned (see Section 2.1). HR is a summary of the risk difference between
several survival curves estimated by Cox’s proportional hazards model
(Therneau and Grambsch, 2000). Cox’s model assumes that the relative risk
of event between groups is constant at each interval of time. The hazard
function for a patient i as deﬁned by Cox’s proportional hazards model, can
be written as

λi(t)= λ0(t)exp(βgi)

(5)

Given the nature of the variable G, λ0(t) is the hazard function for a patient in
the low-risk group. Moreover, the hazard function for any patient in the high-
risk group is ψ λ0(t) (proportional hazards), so ψ is the HR with ψ =exp(β).
Note that, in this study, the larger the HR, the larger is the difference in
survival probabilities between the groups of patients, and consequently the
better is the discrimination between low- and high-risk groups.

2.4 Performance comparison
To test whether a method performs signiﬁcantly better than another one, we
used two types of statistical tests: (i) a paired Student t-test based on the
assumption of normality for the natural logarithm of the hazard ratio (i.e.
the coefﬁcient β in Cox’s proportional hazards model) and the concordance
index; (ii) a paired Wilcoxon rank sum test of event occurrence with respect to
the time t for the AUC(t) and BSC(t). We considered that a method performs
signiﬁcantly better than another one if its performance is signiﬁcantly better
with a P <0.05 and the difference between the performance estimates of the
two methods is larger than 1% of the lowest value. Note that we did not
statistically compare the estimations of sensitivity and speciﬁcity due to the
lack of standard statistical test.

The concordance indices and the hazard ratios for all the risk prediction
methods are represented using a forest plot (Lewis and Clarke, 2001).
The accuracy measures are shown as squares centered on the point estimate

of the performance of each method. A horizontal line runs through the square
to show its 95% conﬁdence interval.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Breast cancer datasets
In order to compare different risk prediction methods with published
gene signatures, we used four large microarray BC datasets collected
with Affymetrix microarray platform (22 283 common probes),
called VDX (Wang et al., 2005), TBG (Desmedt et al., 2007),
TAM (Haibe-Kains et al., 2008; Loi et al., 2007) and UPP (Miller
et al., 2005). These datasets are publicly available from the
GEO database2 through accession numbers GSE2034, GSE7390,
GSE6532/GSE9195 and GSE3494, respectively. VDX includes
the gene expressions of 286 untreated node-negative BC patients
and was used to build GENE76 and to validate GGI (see end
of Section 2.2). Only TBG exhibited the same criteria for the
selection of patients (198) than VDX, i.e. untreated node-negative
BC patients, and was used as an ofﬁcial validation of GENE76
and GGI. TAM was composed of 354 ER-positive BC patients (the
largest molecular group of BC) being homogeneously treated by
tamoxifen therapy. UPP was composed of 251 patients being treated
with heterogeneous therapies. Although the selection of patients was
different for VDX and TBG, TAM and UPP datasets might contain
important prognostic information as well and could, therefore, be
used as additional validation sets. Due to their homogeneity in
selection of patients, we should consider VDX and TBG as the most
important datasets in this comparative study. The results obtained
with TAM and UPP made possible a more thorough assessment of
the performance.

We considered the distant metastasis free survival of BC patients
as the survival endpoint for VDX, TBG and TAM. This endpoint
refers to the appearance of distant metastasis only. We considered
the relapse free survival of BC patients, i.e. appearance of local,
regional or distant relapses, in UPP as the information on distant
metastasis was not available. All the survival data were censored at
10 years as in Desmedt et al. (2007).

We used VDX as training set and TBG, TAM and UPP as
validation sets. Although this choice was guided by the original
publications in BC prognostication, we also performed all the
analyses using TBG as training set to ensure that our results were
not driven by the choice of the training set (Michiels et al., 2005).
We obtained similar results that let the conclusions of this study
unchanged (see Section 10 in Supplementary Material).

We assessed the performance in the training set and in the three
validation sets using all the risk prediction methods summarized in
Table 1. The AURKA model was used as reference because of its
low complexity. Both risk score and risk group predictions were
compared.

et al., 2006; van de Vijver et al., 2002). GGI was the best method
in two validation sets, yielding larger speciﬁcity values than the
simplest model AURKA. The increase was estimated to 17.4, 2.8
and 1.5% for TBG, TAM and UPP datasets, respectively.

The performance assessment using the concordance index, the
time-dependent ROC curve and the Brier score are given in
Supplementary Figures 1, 2–5 and 6–9, respectively.

Looking at the most complex models, i.e. multivariate (MULTIV)
survival (SURV) models using genome-wide data (GW) and
GENE76, we observed overoptimistic performance estimates in
training set compared to the validation sets. Although we used
advanced machine learning techniques to control overﬁtting, i.e.
linear combination of univariate models or L1 regularization in
Cox’s proportional hazards model, these complex models failed to
outperform simpler ones in a validation setting.

The simple AURKA model was competitive in all the datasets.
As mentioned earlier, we statistically compared the performance of
all the models with AURKA (Table 3). Only GGI was signiﬁcantly
better in at least two validation sets whatever the accuracy measure.
It is worth to note that AURKA outperformed KM, the benchmark
model for the Brier score (see Section 2.3.4), in all the datasets
except for TBG.

As we did not observe a signiﬁcant improvement using cross-
validated dimension reduction strategies (see Section 2.2.1), we
reported the performance of the methods using either RANKCV
or PCACV in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

We computed all the pairwise performance comparisons (see
Section 9.1 in Supplementary Material) and observed again that
complex models performed poorly in validation sets compared to
simpler ones. According to the IAUC performance criterion in TBG
dataset, the GW methods using SURV phenotype are signiﬁcantly
better than the other risk prediction methods. However,
these
signiﬁcant results are not conﬁrmed in the other validation sets.
We noticed also that, unlike GGI, GENE76 was consistently worse
than most of the other considered methods.

3.3 Risk group prediction
This section presents the results for the performance assessment
of the risk group predictions using the ﬁve performance criteria
presented in Section 2.3. We used the tertile to deﬁne the risk groups
(see Section 2.2), leaving 33% of the patients in the low-risk group
and the remaining 66% in the high-risk group. This proportion is
usually observed in BC prognostication (Buyse et al., 2006; Desmedt
et al., 2007; van’t Veer et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005).

The sensitivity and the speciﬁcity for all the risk prediction
methods are reported in Table 4. Again, we observed values for
sensitivity and speciﬁcity that are consistent with the literature. GGI
was the best method in two validation sets, yielding larger sensitivity
and speciﬁcity values than the simplest model AURKA. However,
the difference is small except for TBG dataset.

The performance assessment of the risk group predictions using
the concordance index, the HR and the Brier score are given in
Supplementary Figures 10, 11 and 12–15, respectively.

Similarly to the risk score prediction, the simple AURKA model
was competitive in all
the datasets. We statistically compared
the performance of all the models with AURKA (see Table 5).
In order to illustrate the gain of using GGI over AURKA for
risk groups prediction, we compared the survival curves for each
dataset separately (see Supplementary Figs 16–19). Because neither
AURKA nor GGI were ﬁtted on VDX, this dataset is not considered
as a training set. We observed a substantial improvement in risk
group prediction in terms of survival probabilities in the low-risk
group in using the risk groups predicted by GGI compared to
AURKA. At 5 years, the increase in survival probabilities in the
low-risk group was estimated to 2, 6, 0 and 1% for VDX, TBG,
TAM and UPP, respectively.

As we did not observe a signiﬁcant improvement using cross-
validated dimension reduction strategies, we reported the results of
the methods using either RANKCV or PCACV in Supplementary
Tables 5 and 6.

We computed all the pairwise comparisons (see Section 9.2 in
Supplementary Material) and made similar observations than for the
risk score prediction. This holds true if we restrict the analysis to
TBG dataset. However, less signiﬁcant differences between methods
were detected. This can be explained by the loss of prognostic
information due to the risk group creation.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We assisted recently to intense research in BC prognostication due
to a growing availability of high-dimensional genomic information
that could potentially be used for risk prediction (Simon, 2005).
The situation is often characterized by a relatively small number
of patients and a large number of explanatory variables. This high-
dimensional setting can be seen as an opportunity to create better
risk prediction models compared to those solely based on clinical
data and/or single markers. At the same time this prevents from a
straightforward use of classical approaches of statistical modeling
and data analysis.

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst that has
systematically compared the performance of state-of-the-art survival
methods for BC prognostication from gene expression data by using
a training/validation framework and several accuracy measures for
survival prediction. The public availability of large microarray BC
datasets and the recently introduced measures for performance

assessment
in survival analysis allow to perform an in-depth
comparative study in order to elucidate the key characteristics of
a successful risk prediction method and to bring new insights into
BC prognostication.

We used four large microarray BC datasets (one for training and
three for validation) in order to compute unbiased estimates of ﬁve
accuracy measures (see Section 2.3) for 13 risk prediction methods
(see Section 2.2). As expected, we observed that complex methods,
e.g. multivariate survival models ﬁtted using dimension reduction
from genome-wide data or GENE76, performed very well in the
training set. However, the performances in the validation sets were
poorer and they failed to outperform consistently the simplest model,
i.e. AURKA, in spite of the use of machine learning strategies
(namely combination of univariate models or regularization) to

reduce the risk of overﬁtting. These results highlighted the fact that
the loss of interpretability deriving from the use of overcomplex
methods in survival analysis of BC microarray data might be not
sufﬁciently counterbalanced by an improvement in the quality of
prediction.

Interestingly, AURKA, the simplest model deﬁning the risk score
as the expression of a single proliferation gene, performed well in all
the survival prediction tasks. From Tables 3 and 5, we noticed that
AURKA was signiﬁcantly better than KM, the benchmark model
ignoring all genetic information, except only for the risk score
prediction in TBG. Several other methods outperformed consistently
KM as shown in Supplementary Figures 22 and 25. These results
are very encouraging for BC prognostication as it was shown that,
in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma prognostication for instance, most

The accuracy measures in bold are signiﬁcantly better than the accuracy of AURKA model. In case of IBSC, the accuracy measures of AURKA are in bold if they are signiﬁcantly
better than KM, the benchmark model, whatever the performance improvement.
aAs AURKA and GGI models were not ﬁtted on VDX, this dataset can be considered as a validation set.

prediction models were not better than KM in a validation setting
[see discussion of Schumacher et al. (2007)]. Moreover, GGI was
the only model that outperformed AURKA in at least two validation
sets whatever the accuracy measure for risk score and risk group
predictions. As GGI is a linear combination of proliferation gene
expressions (see Section 2.2), these results highlight the importance
of proliferation measured by gene expression proﬁling in BC
prognostication, and conﬁrm the results of Sotiriou et al. (2006a, b).
In order to go further in the comparison of the different risk
prediction methods, we computed all the pairwise performance
comparisons for all the methods (see Section 9 in Supplementary
Material) and we observed that models using only the biologically
driven selection of genes of interest (BD) led to similar performance
than models using genome-wide data (GW) with ranking (RANK)
or principal components analysis (PCA). This suggests that ﬁnding
a combination of relevant variables in a high-dimensional setting is
a difﬁcult task since simple dimension reduction methods did not
succeed to signiﬁcantly improve the models from genome-wide data
compared to simpler models using a very small set of genes selected
from literature. Our results are consistent with earlier studies focused
on stability of feature selection for GW methods (Ein-Dor et al.,
2005; Michiels et al., 2005). Moreover, we observed that models
ﬁtting the histological grade (HG) as phenotype performed globally
better in validation sets than models ﬁtting survival data (SURV
or TOE) suggesting that we did not succeed to catch additional
information about prognostication in using survival models. The fact
that the performance of GGI was the best in validation sets reinforced
this observation as the GGI was built using a method similar to our
weighted combination of relevant genes for the histological grade
(see Section 2.2).

It is worth to mention that all the accuracy measures were in nice
agreement in our comparative study. Smaller signiﬁcant differences
in performance estimates were detected by the IAUC and the IBSC
criteria, probably due to the type of statistical test [paired Wilcoxon

rank sum test for AUC(t) or BSC(t) compared to paired Student
t-test for C-index or HR, see Section 2.3].

A ﬁnal analysis concerns the performance comparison with the
classical indicators, such as the histological grade (Scarff and
Torloni, 1968), AOL (Olivotto et al., 2005) and NPI (Galea et al.,
1992). In our comparative study, GGI was consistently better than
the histological grade (data not shown). We were not able to compute
the risk scores for AOL and NPI on TAM and UPP datasets due to
lack of information. As shown in Supplementary Table 10, AURKA
and GGI outperformed consistently AOL in the VDX and TBG
datasets, except for the IAUC in TBG. However, this is not the case
for NPI. These results suggest that the superiority of microarray-
based risk prediction methods is not obvious and need further
investigations.

In conclusion, our results challenge the use of microarray
technology to screen the whole genome for BC prognostication
of global populations of patients. Indeed, we found that models
using a single gene or a small set of biologically driven selected
genes yielded similar or even better performance than models ﬁtted
from genome-wide data. Although GGI, the model yielding the best
performances in validation sets, uses a set of 128 probes, it can be
considered as a simple extension of AURKA, i.e. a quantiﬁcation
of proliferation using more genes. Moreover the authors recently
showed that we could yield similar performance in using only a
small subset of these 128 probes (Durbecq et al., 2007). The use of
high-sensitivity gene expression proﬁling technologies such as the
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, in addition to be
cheaper and more user friendly, might improve the performance of
these risk prediction models.

The relevance of proliferation for BC prognostication was
previously reported by several other research groups. Indeed,
Thomassen et al. (2007) found that cell cycle and cell proliferation
represented the predominant overlaps in gene ontology categories
of the nine prognostic signatures they compared. Yu et al. (2007)

2206

also conducted pathway analyses of ﬁve published prognostic gene
signatures and found that the signatures had many pathways in
common such as cell cycle, regulation of cell cycle, mitosis,
apoptosis, etc. Our group also investigated in a large meta-analysis of
publicly available gene expression data, how different gene lists may
give rise to signatures with equivalent prognostic performance and
found by dissecting these signatures according to the main molecular
processes involved in breast cancer, that proliferation may be the
common driving force of several prognostic signatures (Sotiriou
et al., 2006a).

Until now, the generation of the prognostic signatures has been
done on global populations of BC patients. However, since it
is clear that breast cancer is a molecular heterogeneous disease,
with subgroups deﬁned primarily by the estrogen (ER) and HER2
receptors (Perou et al., 2000; Sotiriou et al., 2003), prognosis
could be reﬁned to these molecularly homogeneous subgroups of
patients. We showed, for example, in a meta-analysis recently
published by our group that proliferation is the strongest parameter
predicting clinical outcome in the ER+/HER2− subgroup of patients
only (group of patients representing more than 66% of the global
population), whereas immune response and tumor invasion appear
to be the main biological processes associated with prognosis in the
ER−/HER2− and HER2+ subgroups, respectively (Desmedt et al.,
2008; Sotiriou et al., 2007). These recent results suggest that we
could improve BC prognostication by restricting the genome-wide
analysis to speciﬁc molecular subtypes. This will be the subject of
further investigations.
