Supplementary Fig.3.ppt AAV treated Untreated-SG H & E AAV treated Untreated Heart Leg muscle Supplementary Figure 3 Supplementary Figure 3 High-efficiency-sarcoglycan (-SG) gene transfer and profound improvement in histopathology of heart and muscle of TO-2 hamsters.
Six-week-old Adult TO-2 hamsters were injected 1 1012 v.g.
of dsAAV8--SG vector.
Heart and leg muscles (triceps) were analyzed by-SG immunofluorescent staining and H & E histology staining at 7 months after vector delivery.
Supra-normal expression of-GS in numerous cardiomyocytes was apparent (white arrowheads).
Severe fibrosis and calcification in untreated heart were visible (black arrows).
Efficient-GS expression in limb muscle also resulted in normal histology, whereas the untreated muscle showed extensive degeneration and regeneration, as shown by the presence of centrally localized nuclei in myofibers (blue color of DAPI counter staining and H & E staining).
Scale bar, 100 m.
