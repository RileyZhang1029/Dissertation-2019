Cells.
Rat Fao liver cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
At 70-80% confluency, cells were serum depleted for 12 hours prior to the experiments.
Reagents including tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and JNK inhibitors were gently added to the culture dishes in the incubator to prevent any environmental stress due to vibration, temperature changes and light exposure.
JNK inhibitors were added 1 hour before tunicamycin/thapsigargin treatment.
The XBP-1/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (S1), IRE-1/ MEF cells (kindly provided by Dr. David Ron, New York University School of Medicine), and their WT controls were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% FBS.
A similar protocol was followed for experiments in MEF cells, except that the cells were serum depleted for only 6 hours Overexpression of XBP-1s in MEFs.
MEF-tet-off cells (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were cultured in DMEM with 100 g/ml G418 and 1 g/ml doxycycline.
The MEF-tet-off cells express exogenous tTA (tetracycline-controlled transactivator) protein, which binds to TRE (tetracycline response element) and activates transcription only in the absence of tetracycline or doxycycline.
The cDNA of the spliced form of XBP-1 was ligated into pTRE2hyg2 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).
The MEF Science Supporting Online Material zcan et al., p. 2 tet-off cells were transfected with the TRE2hyg2-XBP-1s plasmid, followed by selection in the presence of 400 g/ml hygromycin B.
Individual clones of stable transfectants were isolated and doxycycline-dependent XBP-1s expression was confirmed by immunoblotting in each experiment.
Northern blot analysis.
Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), separated by 1% agarose gel, and then transferred onto BrightStar Plus nylon membrane (Ambion, Austin, TX).
GRP78 cDNA probe was prepared from mouse liver total cDNAs by RT-PCR using the following primers: 5TGGAGTTCCCCAGATTGAAG-3 and 5-CCTGACCCACCTTTTTCTCA-3.

Protein extracts from cells.
At the end of each treatment, cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80oC.
Protein extracts were prepared with a lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 5 g/ml leupeptin, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 10 nM okadaic acid, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).
Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting experiments were performed with 750 g and 75 g total protein, respectively without any freeze-thaw cycles from individual aliquots.
Animal studies and obesity models.
Adult (10-12 weeks of age) male ob/ob mice and their WT littermates were purchased from Jackson Labs.
Mice used in the diet-induced obesity model were male C57BL/6.
All mice were placed on high fat diet (HFD: 35.5% fat, 20% protein, 32.7% carbohydrates, Bio-Serve) immediately after weaning (at ~3 weeks of age).
The XBP-1+/ and XBP-1+/+ mice were on BALB/c genetic background.
Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were performed as previously described (S3).
Insulin and C-peptide ELISA were performed according to manufacturers instructions using mouse standards (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL).
Pancreas isolated from 16week-old mice was fixed in Bouin's fluid and formalin, and paraffin sections were double-stained with guinea pig anti-insulin and rabbit anti-glucagon antibodies.
Texas red dye conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG and FITC conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies.
Insulin infusion and tissue protein extraction.
Insulin was injected through the portal vein as previously described (S2, S3).
Three minutes after insulin infusion, liver was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80C until processing.
For protein extraction, liver tissue (~0.3g) was placed in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 10 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM NaF, 50 mM Na4P2O7, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 5 g/ml leupeptin, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 10 nM okadaic acid, and 2 mM PMSF.
After homogenization on ice, the tissue lysate was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4C followed by 55,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4C.
One milligram of total tissue protein was used for immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting, whereas 100150 g total tissue protein was used for direct immunoblotting (S3).

Inhibition of insulin receptor signaling by thapsigargin-induced ER stress and the role of calcium levels in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation.
(A) ER stress was induced in Fao cells by 1-hour treatment with 300 nM thapsigargin (Thap), and cells were subsequently stimulated with insulin (Ins).
IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) and serine phosphorylation (pSer307), insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine phosphorylation, and total protein levels were examined using either immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by immunoblotting (IB) or direct immunobloting.
(B) Fao cells were treated with sulindac sulfide (SS: 0, 7.5, 30, and 60 M) for 45 minutes with or without an additional hour of exposure to 300 nM thapsigargin (Thap).
IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and total IRS-1 protein levels were examined as described above.
These results demonstrate that treatment of cells with thapsigargin, an agent that induces ER stress by inhibiting calcium ATPase, also increased IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and suppressed insulin receptor signaling.
The use of sulindac sulfide to block calcium influx to the cytosol from the extracellular compartment addresses whether thapsigargininduced inhibition of insulin action was simply due to alterations in cellular calcium levels.
Treatment with sulindac sulfide alone had no effect on Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1.
Furthermore, in the presence of thapsigargin, sulindac sulfide did not interfere with IRS-1 serine phosphorylation indicating that the effect of thapsigargin on Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and inhibition of insulin receptor signaling is mediated through ER stress.

Insulin sensitivity in lean XBP-1+/ and XBP-1+/+ mice.
In XBP-1+/ and XBP1+/+ mice placed on regular chow diet, blood insulin (A) and c-peptide (B) levels were measured, and glucose (C) and insulin tolerance tests (D) were performed at 16 weeks of age.
On chow diet, there was no difference in blood glucose levels, C-peptide levels, and insulin sensitivity measured by glucose and insulin tolerance tests between genotypes followed up to 18 weeks of age.
At the onset of the HFD experiment, there was also no difference in glucose metabolism between XBP-1+/ and XBP-1+/+ mice as determined by fasting and fed blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels, and by intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests.
Serum levels of leptin (26.22.5 and 25.21.8 ng/ml in XBP-1+/+ and XBP-1+/, respectively), adiponectin (15.51.8 and 16.61.6 ng/dl in XBP-1+/+ and XBP-1+/, respectively) and triglycerides (67.75.5 and 62.83.4 mg/dl in XBP-1+/+ and XBP-1+/, respectively) did not exhibit any statistically significant differences between the genotypes measured after 16 weeks of HFD.
Blood insulin levels in XBP-1+/+ mice were significantly lower than those in XBP-1+/ littermates (0.890.25 and 2.270.32 ng/ml in XBP-1+/+ and XBP-1+/ after 20 weeks on HFD, respectively, p<0.05).
C-peptide levels were also significantly higher in XBP-1+/ animals than in WT controls (772.91132.24 and 1374.11241.8 ng/ml in XBP-1+/+ and XBP-1+/ (p<0.05).

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in XBP-1+/ and WT mice.
Glucose was administered introperitoneally to mice in each genotype following 16 weeks of high fat diet and blood samples are collected at the indicated times for insulin measurements.
In these experiments, there was no detectable abnormality in the XBP+/ islets and no difference was evident between genotypes under standard conditions.
On HFD, both the XBP-1+/ and XBP-1+/+ mice exhibited islet hyperplasia.
This anticipated response to HFD was similar between genotypes and the hyperplastic component (islet size >150 M) comprised 40% of all islets in XBP-1+/ and 43% of all islets in WT mice on HFD.
In experiments examining glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in XBP-1+/ and WT mice on HFD, the XBP-1+/ mice responded to glucose with even a stronger insulin secretory response, which effectively eliminates the possibility of an isolated islet defect underlying their phenotype.
Hence, these data indicate that the phenotype of the XBP-1+/ mice cannot be attributed to defective islets and even after 16 weeks on HFD, the islets appear indistinguishable between genotypes.
However, our data does not rule out involvement of XBP-1 in islet function during obesity and diabetes.
