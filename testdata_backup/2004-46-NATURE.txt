The structure of the membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 has been determined by X-ray crystallography at about 4 A resolution.
Here we describe the structure and location of proteins P3, P16, P30 and P31.
Different structural proteins seem to have specialist roles in controlling virus assembly.
The linearly extended P30 appears to nucleate the formation of the icosahedral facets (composed of trimers of the major capsid protein, P3) and acts as a molecular tape-measure, defining the size of the virus and cementing the facets together.
Pentamers of P31 form the vertex base, interlocking with subunits of P3 and interacting with the membrane protein P16.
The architectural similarities with adenovirus and one of the largest known virus particles PBCV-1 support the notion that themechanism of assembly of PRD1 is scaleable and applies across the major viral lineage formed by these viruses.
PRD1 is a double-stranded DNA bacteriophage and prototype member of the Tectiviridae.
It infects Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica.
The mature virion has a molecular mass of 66 MDa and comprises over 20 distinct protein species1.
Protein P3 (43 kDa) is the major component of the capsid, with 240 trimers arranged on an icosahedral lattice with pseudo-T 25 triangulation.
Pentamers of protein P31 (14 kDa) occupy the icosahedral vertices and associate with the trimeric P5 protein (34 kDa) and the receptor-binding protein P2 (64 kDa) to form flexible spikes2.
The minor capsid protein P30 (9 kDa) is required for virus assembly3.
The 15-kilobase linear viral genome is packaged into preformed procapsids4 through a unique vertex5,6, fuelled by the ATPase P9 (J.K.H.B., unpublished data).
PRD1 is very different from the traditional DNA bacteriophages: instead of a tail it uses its internal membrane, acquired from the host during virus assembly4,7, as an ejection device8,9.
In addition, there is no critical capsid expansion after DNA packaging10.
However, PRD1 is remarkably similar to adenovirus, and several lines of evidence, including the structural homology between the major structural proteins, support the hypothesis that the two viruses have a common ancestor1113.
Recently, the same structural characteristics have been found in the giant PBCV-1 (Phycodnaviridae family) and CIV viruses (Iridoviridae family)1315, indicating that PRD1 belongs to an extensive lineage, whose origin might predate the division of the bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic domains of life13.
Previous cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) analysis of the PRD1 virion and X-ray analysis of isolated P3 illuminated aspects of PRD1 architecture10,11,16,17 but the analysis presented here, using crystals of the PRD1 Sus539 mutant1,18, reveals in atomic detail the key structural proteins, lays bare the organization of the capsid shell and reveals the membrane.
The structure of the membrane is described in the accompanying paper19.
Here we focus on the architecture of the PRD1 capsid, which suggests a scaleable assembly pathway that might apply to some of the largest known viruses and reveals receptor-binding vertex connections to the viral membrane.
Overall architecture of the virus and structural proteins The structure determination at about 4 A resolution for the PRD1 Sus539 mutant is described in Methods.
Phase information was obtained by combining an X-ray structure of the major capsid protein11,20 with a cryo-EM reconstruction of the virus10,16.
Neglecting magnification errors, the deviation between Ca atoms derived from EM/X-ray hybrid imaging and the final X-ray structure is less than 2 A within an icosahedral asymmetric unit.
The resolution of the resultant electron density map is sufficient to resolve the b-strands in protein P3 (Fig.1a).
In addition, data from crystals of selenomethionated (SeMet) virus provide a SeMet difference Fourier map.
Using these two electron density maps we have constructed atomic models for the minor capsid protein P30, the vertex protein P31, the membrane protein P16 and previously undescribed portions of the major capsid protein (see Methods).
The analysis is based on 60-fold averaged electron density in which proteins not obeying the icosahedral symmetry are smeared out and are essentially invisible.
PRD1 measures about 640 A between opposite faces and 700 A between opposite vertices.
The Sus539 mutant lacks P2, the receptor-binding protein, whereas the trimeric P5 is not seen in the averaged electron density.
The 240 trimers of protein P3 dominate the PRD1 capsid (Fig.1b).
Each P3 subunit is composed of two jellyroll domains11,20, giving the trimer a pseudo-hexagonal shape.
The icosahedral asymmetric unit of the virus is composed of four P3 trimers (Fig.1b) arranged in a uniform orientation within the roughly planar facet (root-mean-square (r.m.s.)
deviation from planarity 6.9 A), to give the pseudo-T 25 lattice characteristic of PRD1 and adenovirus.
The cores of the 12 independent copies of P3 are essentially identical to each other and to the single crystal structures of isolated P3 (ref.
11) (r.m.s.
deviation in Ca atoms, after superposition, is about 1 A).
There are, however, different conformations for the short amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal extensions, depending on the location of the subunit in the surface lattice of the virus, leading to small differences in the conformation of some loops (Fig.1c).
We find that the capsid contains 60 copies of the small protein P30 (83 residues).
This protein is essential for the assembly of complete particles3.
P30 is remarkably extended, with essentially no secondary structure and dimensions of about 150 60 10 A3 articles NATURE | VOL 432 | 4 NOVEMBER 2004 | www.nature.com/nature68 2004 Nature Publishing Group (Fig.1d).
The electron density of P30 is continuous, and detailed structural interpretation was assisted by the SeMet difference Fourier map, which pinpointed the methionine residues at positions 24, 45 and 69 (see Fig.1d).
The molecule is rich in proline residues (13%) and analysis of its amino acid sequence with PONDR21 indicates that in the absence of other viral components at least the N-terminal half of the subunit would be disordered.
The 60 copies of P30 completely festoon the virus, being suspended about 12 A above the viral membrane by numerous interactions with P3 (Fig.1d).
N-terminal hooks (the only deviation from a fully extended conformation) lock two P30 subunits into the dimeric building block of the network (dimer interactions are restricted to about the first 30 residues of the subunit).
Dimer axes coincide with icosahedral two-fold axes and the protein follows closely the outline of the P3 facet (P30/P3 interactions are described below).
Pentamers of protein P31 plug the 60-A diameter holes in the P3/P30 shell at the five-fold vertices.
P31 forms a compact eightstranded b-barrel with jellyroll topology (Fig.1e), elaborated only by 13-residue and 8-residue extensions at the N and C termini respectively.
Residues 5118 of the 126-amino-acid subunit have been modelled with the aid of the SeMet difference Fourier map.
P31 resembles half of a P3 subunit and can be superposed almost equally well on either of the P3 jellyrolls (82 and 83 Ca atoms superposed for domains 1 and 2, respectively, in each case with an Figure 1 Architecture and structural components of bacteriophage PRD1.

Finally, beneath each P31 pentamer lie five copies of protein P16.
Residues 756 and 94116 are visible in the electron density, with residues 728 forming a transmembrane helix.
The assignment of P16 is described in Methods.
Conformational switching in P3 underlies capsid assembly In closed assemblies, geometric constraints prevent an exactly symmetric arrangement of more than 60 subunits.
The switching of subunit conformation during the assembly process provides a mechanism for building more complex systems (see, for example, refs 23 and 24), and this was suggested for PRD1 (ref.
17).
The 720 subunits of P3 present in each PRD1 particle occupy 12 distinct local environments within each facet (Fig.2), which define the conformations of the N-terminal and C-terminal extensions.
Whereas in the intact virus these extensions are generally well ordered, in the crystal structure of isolated P3 both termini were disordered (about 13 and 11 residues respectively)11,20 implying that there is little energetic penalty in switching between conformers.
The N termini of P3 fall into two distinct conformations (denoted NI and NII) that converge at residue 18 (between 9 and 12 A above the outer leaflet of the membrane).
Residues 1834 form an a-helix that runs away from the membrane.
In one set of conformations (NII, shown in dark blue in Figs 1c and 2) this helix is longer, beginning at residue 8, and is preceded by a short extended section of chain that contacts the membrane (Fig.2).
Three of the first six amino acids are glutamine residues, which probably attach to the Figure 2 Switching of the P3 termini.

Three-fold and pseudo-three-fold axes are depicted as small triangles, red and grey respectively.
For each P3 subunit, the N terminus is shown as a straight or kinked helix and the C terminus as a small arrow, coloured according to the key.

Left, five copies of P16 (red) are arranged around each vertex, between the peripentonal P3 trimers (grey), of which three are shown.
Each copy of P16 contributes disordered residues to the 25 A 30 A cylindrical cavity under the vertex base protein P31 (magenta).
The first six residues of P16 beneath the membrane are disordered but are shown for completeness.

The N terminus of the peripentonal P3 subunit furthest from the vertex (light blue) contacts P16 at the membrane.
The loop connecting the two jellyrolls of the P3 subunit nearest the vertex (yellow) is clipped between P16 residues 4354 and the P16 C-terminal helix, which is flanked on the other side by the corresponding P3 N terminus (dark blue).

These membraneanchoring P3 subunits are found along the edge of the icosahedral facets and might help to stabilize the fold in the membrane that occurs at this intersection19.
In the other N-terminal conformation (NI, shown in cyan in Figs 1c and 2), the residues preceding 18 form a short a-helix twisted away from the membrane (Fig.2) to interact with another subunit of the P3 trimer and, for subunits within the body of the facet, with the C termini (residues 385390) of P3 subunits from neighbouring trimers.
This conformational switching allows the P3 N termini to stabilize either the viral membrane or interactions with neighbouring P3 molecules.
The switching of the P3 C termini is central to the assembly process, because these structures mediate P3 trimertrimer interactions.
As with the N-terminal switching, the four subunits within the body of the icosahedral face have essentially the same structure (denoted CI in Figs 1c and 2).
In this conformation, after a short helix (residues 383389) the final six residues extend to form a trimeric interaction with termini from neighbouring trimers, locking a set of three trimers together (Fig.2).
The electron density and the presence of acidic residues suggest that this structure might be further stabilized by a divalent cation lying on the local inter-trimer three-fold axis.
In conformation CII (brick red on Figs 1c and 2), adopted by six subunits, the helix is replaced by an extended chain.
These extensions (which constitute three subsets, CIIac; see Fig.2) form b-structures with P30, which threads between the P3 trimers of neighbouring facets.
P30 is clamped by P3 in four b-sheets along the edge of the facet (Fig.2), stabilizing the facet interface.
The final two P3 C-terminal structures (short red arrows in Fig.2, found in the peripentonal P3 trimers and subunits abutting them) are disordered, eliminating C-terminal interactions between the peripentonal trimers and the rest of the structure.
Interactions at the vertex Five subunits of P31 pack with their jellyrolls vertical to form the pentameric base of the vertex spike (Fig.3a).
The pentamer is stabilized by residues 914 (strand A in Fig.1e) clipping onto strand B of the adjacent P31 b-barrel and by side-to-side interactions between the BIDG sheet of one subunit and strands G and F of its neighbour.
A series of interactions engage the P31 pentamer with the P3 subunits that surround it.
The nine N-terminal residues of P31 interdigitate between the B1C1 and B2C2 b-strands of fivefold related P3 subunits, and the ACHEF face of P31 nestles between the two jellyrolls of a peripentonal P3 subunit (Fig.3a).
There is a symmetry mismatch between the pentameric P31 and the trimeric spike protein P5 (a similar symmetry mismatch is found in adenovirus25).
P31 and the N-terminal domain of P5 share 38% sequence identity26,27, which might allow a mixed pentameric association of P31 with the N-terminal domains of P5 (ref.
28).
However, there is little evidence for this in the electron density maps: P31 is generally well defined, although the attenuation of the SeMet difference Fourier peak for residue Met9 would be consistent with up to two of the five subunits being P5.
The C termini of P31 lie close to the five-fold axes, in line with direct P5P31 interactions at these axes17,27.
Below P31, in a position where unidentified density was seen in cryo-EM analysis17, lies the 117-residue integral membrane protein P16 (ref.
29) (Fig.3b, c), anchored into the membrane through a single transmembrane helix (residues 728).
Residues 16 are disordered beneath the membrane, with the triple lysine sequence 35 presumably stabilizing the negative charge of the viral DNA.
There is no electron density for residues 5793, indicating that this portion (denoted loop5793) does not obey icosahedral symmetry.
The trajectory of the polypeptide chain entering and leaving loop5793 indicates that it resides in a cylindrical cavity under the vertex (Fig.3b), which it largely fills (see Supplementary Methods).
P16 engages in extensive interactions with the P3 trimers adjacent to the vertex and the C-terminal region of the cementing protein P30 (Fig.3b).
The vertex complexes and peripentonal P3 trimers are labile in PRD1 virions lacking P16 (ref.
29), whereas removal of the phage membrane from PRD1 particles lacking DNA, by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate, removes the vertex complex and peripentonal P3 trimers30.
Thus P16 acts as a second cementing protein stabilizing the vertices, a function analogous to that of adenovirus polypeptide VI (ref.
31).
The observed lability of the vertex might facilitate the formation of a pore in the capsid for egress of the PRD1 DNA injection tube32.
The disordered loop5793 probably forms non-icosahedrally symmetric interactions with the vertex base, presumably explaining arms of electron density seen connecting the P16 region and capsid vertex in the cryo-EM analysis17.
The breakdown in icosahedral symmetry might reflect the symmetry mismatch between the pentameric vertex base and the trimeric spike shaft.
Perhaps P16 acts as the component that transmits the receptor-binding signal to the membrane, priming the metastable system for DNA ejection2.
In addition to P16, 11 further protein species have been reported to be associated with the viral membrane1,4,3235; in particular, two integral membrane proteins and two capsid-associated proteins are located at a unique vertex responsible for DNA packaging5,6.
We see no evidence of these proteins in the averaged electron density maps and unaveraged electron density maps show no features to suggest a preferred orientation of the special vertices within the crystal lattice.
Visualization of the remaining membrane proteins is therefore probably beyond the reach of the current data.

Large viruses frequently use a scaffolding protein to drive assembly and control the capsid size36, for example gp8 of bacteriophage P22 and gp7 of bacteriophage f29, both of which are elongated proteins with a substantial a-helical content36,37.
P30 of PRD1 is even more elongated, being almost completely extended, allowing the dimer to span the entire edge of an icosahedral facet (about 300 A).
In effect P30 acts as a molecular tape-measure, a function attributed to protein YscP in the assembly of the bacterial injectisome, and also responsible for the determination of phage tail length (ref.
