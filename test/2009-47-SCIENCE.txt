Van Gilst* The study of starvation-resistant biological programs has elucidated numerous mechanisms influencing aging.
Here we present the discovery and characterization of starvation-induced adult reproductive diapause (ARD) in Caenorhabditis elegans.
ARD differs from the C. elegans dauer diapause in that it enables sexually mature adults to delay reproductive onset 15-fold and extend total adult life span at least threefold.
The effectiveness of ARD requires apoptotic death of the entire germ line, except for a small population of protected germline stem cells (GSCs).
When feeding is resumed, surviving GSCs regenerate a new germ line capable of offspring production near the level of nonstarved animals.
The starvation-sensing nuclear receptor NHR-49 is required for ARD entry and recovery.
Our findings establish mechanisms for preserving stem cell potency and reproductive potential during prolonged starvation.
Upon severe dietary restriction, many orga-nisms, including some mammals, initiateprograms of developmental or repro-ductive diapause, which are reversible states of dormancy (13).
In these states, animals often respond to prolonged starvation by considerably extending their normal life span and reproductive period (35).
Consequently, studying starvation-mediated diapause has provided a wealth of insight into nutritional control of development, reproduction, and aging (69).
When starved, the soil nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans can developmentally arrest at multiple lar-val stages.
The most-studied arrests are the larval stage one (L1) and dauer diapauses.
Embryos that hatch in the absence of food can survive at least 2 weeks of starvation by entering an L1 diapause (5).
Worms entering dauer arrest, an alternative devel-opmental fate specialized for enduring long periods of starvation and stress, can withstand several months of nutrient deprivation (3).
In both cases, worms delay their developmental progression from larvae to adults, which occurs in only 2 days under favorable conditions, by weeks or months.
When food is restored, animals exit the diapause, resume larval development, and mature into adults with full reproductive capacity and a normal adult life span, implying that developmental diapause also halts the aging process in arrested larvae (3, 5, 10).
Discovery of an adult reproductive diapause (ARD).
While studying starvation response in late development, we observed adult reproduc-tive arrest.
When a population of wild-type (WT) hermaphrodites was completely removed from its bacterial food source during the fourth and final stage of larval development (L4), many ani-mals transitioned into adults and halted repro-ductive activities, therefore establishing an ARD (Fig.1A).
ARD initiation was optimal if a de-velopmentally synchronized population of ani-mals was removed from food when the majority of animals were in the mid-L4 stage of develop-ment (fig.
S1, A to C).
In this case, there were three distinct fates: (i) Animals arrested as L4 larvae; (ii) animals arrested as adults harboring no more than one live embryo per gonad arm; or (iii) animals developed into adults with multiple embryos in utero, which hatched and caused death through facultative vivipary, more com-monly known as bagging (11) (Fig.1, C to E).
The relative ratio of these three fates differed depending on when starvation was started.
For example, Fig.1B shows the percentage of each outcome when starvation was initiated at the optimal developmental stage.
However, if star-vation was initiated late in L4 development, the majority of animals would miss the adult arrest and adopt the bagging fate, whereas food with-drawal early in L4 development primarily re-sulted in animals that arrested as L4 larvae (fig.
S1D).
ARD was dependent, in some fashion, on population density, because high densities of worms were required for optimal ARD estab-lishment (see supporting online materials and methods).
Additionally, isolation of individual ARD animals from a dense population of starved worms led to premature diapause exit and bag-ging (table S1).
A distinguishing feature of ARD was inhibi-tion of embryo development and facultative RESEARCHARTICLE Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.

Acute starvation during the fourth larval stage (L4) leads to the formation of ARD, whereas starvation during late L4 or adulthood results in hermaphrodite bagging.
(B) When a population of hermaphrodites in the middle of L4 was acutely starved, we observed three potential outcomes: L4 larval arrest, ARD, and bagged adults.
The data are presented as the mean (TSEM) percentage of animals that adopted each of the three fates.

Under standard laboratory conditions, embryos develop and hatch within 14 hours of fertilization.
If adult worms are starved and do not establish ARD, egg laying is inhibited and hatching of multiple embryos will occur in the uterus within 24 to 48 hours (11).
In contrast, up to two embryos were retained within the uterus of ARD animals for at least 30 days.
These embryos were viable for at least the first 5 days of starvation.
For example, if ARD animals were isolated 3 or 5 days after starvation, thereby pro-moting diapause exit, embryos resumed a more normal rate of development and hatched inside the adult within 24 hours (table S1).
Differential interference contrast (DIC) images suggested that the viability of uterine embryos, as determined by embryo morphology, started to decrease around day 7 of starvation.
Inviable embryo remains then occupied the uterus as corpses (12) (Fig.3F).
These data argue that the ARD mechanism involves slowing or arresting the development of uterine embryos for at least 5 days of star-vation, so that they can resume normal develop-ment and hatching upon ARD exit.
The mechanism for preventing embryonic development in ARD animals is still not appar-ent.
Starvation-induced embryonic diapause is common in many animals, and it has recently been shown that hypoxia can cause embryonic diapause inC. elegans (2, 13).
However, because isolation of individual animals in ARD led to diapause release, we were unable to monitor embryonic development in arrested adults; there-fore, it is not clear whether embryos in these animals fail to hatch because they are in an em-bryonic diapause or development is simply slowed down.
The adult diapause extends life span and reproductive longevity.
In theory, the effec-tiveness of a starvation-induced diapause de-pends on the ability of arrested worms to survive extended periods of starvation, search for im-proved nutritional conditions, and recover to produce offspring.
To characterize the survivabil-ity characteristics of ARD, we measured two parameters in animals rescued from ARD after periods of starvation of up to 30 days.
First, we quantified brood size, a parameter indicative of how well reproductive potential is maintained during starvation (Fig.2A).
Second, we deter-mined how well ARD protected the youth of somatic tissues by measuring the life span of worms after food restoration (Fig.2B).
Entry into ARD offered notable survival ad-vantages over worms that underwent the bagging fate.
Even at 30 days of starvation, arrested adults recovered when returned to food and produced up to 20 progeny through self-fertilization (Fig.2A).
Much larger broods (>100 progeny when starved up to 15 days and >50 at 30 days) were obtainedwhen animals were reintroduced to food and mated with well-fed males.
This result sug-gests that viable oocytes are produced even after very long periods of starvation; however, the fecundity of recovered hermaphrodites that self-fertilize is limited by the survival of functional sperm.
Consistent with this hypothesis, very few sperm are observed in worms starved for ex-tended periods, even after rescue (Fig.3, D and G).

ARD also appears to share the anti-aging properties of other developmental diapauses (Fig.2B).
Animals starved for up to 30 days were able to exit ARD and still live a normal adult life span (~18 days at 20C) when returned to food.
These results are consistent with prior studies showing that starvation of sterilized C. elegans adults can dramatically extend total life span (14).
Our results are distinct from these studies, however, in that we observed the extension of life span and reproductive longevity in fertile WT animals.
Nonetheless, it is possible that sterilization of adult nematodes mimics a com-ponent of the adult arrest and thereby leads to the extension of life span through a similar mechanism.
Protection of germline stem cells (GSCs) and germline regeneration.
Perhaps the most striking feature of ARD was plasticity of the germ line during maintenance and recovery.
Shortly after ARD initiation, we observed sub-stantial loss of cellular volume and germ cell number in the gonad (Fig.3, A to D).
After more prolonged starvation (>10 days), the germ line was reduced to a small population of ~35 germ cell nuclei per gonad arm (Fig.3E).
This sur-viving population of germ cells was main-tained at a relatively constant level for another 20 days, implying that these cells were pro-tected from the mechanism that precipitated death of the rest of the germ line (Fig.3E).
Changes in somatic gonad morphology were also marked by retreat of the distal tip cell (Fig.3B and fig.
S3, A to C).
Reintroduction to food resulted in robust re-covery, so that the germ line of an animal rescued after 30 days of starvation appeared similar to that of a young adult that had never been starved (Fig.3G).
Consequently, exit from ARD must involve processes that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of GSCs in order to regen-erate a fully mature and functional female germ line.
Thus, the population of germ cells protected during extended starvation must contain func-tional GSCs.

13 NOVEMBER 2009 VOL 326 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org956 RESEARCH ARTICLE o n M ar ch 1 7, 2 01 2 w w w.s ci en ce m ag.o rg D ow nl oa de d fr om Programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis in C. elegans is active during adulthood as a means to control total germ cell number in healthy ani-mals and also to mediate germ cell death in response to pathogens, stress, and short-term star-vation (1518).
To determine whether apoptosis was responsible for the germline atrophy ob-served during ARD, we examined the apoptosis-deficient ced-3(n1286) mutant.
The ced-3 gene encodes a caspase essential for apoptosis.
We found that inactivation of ced-3 did not inhibit ARD entry but did prevent the reduction in germ cell nuclei normally observed during the course of ARD (Fig.4, A to C).
Although ced-3(n1286) mutants appeared healthywhen starved for 15 days in ARD, these mutants were unable to success-fully recover upon refeeding, because germ cell proliferation resumed in the distal gonad, but oocyte formation and embryo production were severely impaired (Fig.4, D to F, and fig.
S4, A to D).
These results demonstrate that the PCDmech-anism is a critical factor for extending the re-productive potential of animals rescued from prolonged starvation in ARD.
The germ cell loss observed in ARD could potentially be explained by the normal rate of germline apoptosis in com-bination with a failure to replace dead germ cells with new germ cell proliferation (15).
However, there are clear differences between starvation-mediated cell death, which results in the death of nearly all differentiated cells, and the apoptosis mechanism that functions in the gonad of well-fed animals, which targets only some germline cells in order to nurse growing oocytes (15).
Thus, it is likely that the ARD mechanism is specifically regulating germ cell proliferation and apoptosis.
NHR-49 is required for ARD.
In mammals, both the peroxisome proliferatoractivated recep-tor a (PPARa) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4a (HNF-4a) nuclear receptors (NRs) mediate meta-bolic response to food withdrawal, implying that NRs function in starvation physiology (19, 20).
The C. elegans counterpart of these receptors is the NHR-49 protein, which is an HNF-4a homo-log that mediates the induction of fatty acid ox-idation and gluconeogenesis genes in response to food deprivation (21).
We found that NHR-49 was required for the establishment of ARD.
When nhr-49 loss-of-function animals [nhr-49(nr2041)] were starved at the same point in the L4 program as WT ani-mals, approximately 12% did not arrest as L4s or bag as adults (Fig.5A).
However, less than 1% of these animals entered a normal ARD.
First, in all nhr-49(nr2041) animals that failed to bag, embryos in the uterus were inviable (fig.
S5, A to B).
This observation raises the question of whether nhr-49 mutants are able to arrest em-bryonic development, and consequently only sur-vive extended starvation if dead embryos are produced, thus preventing death via bagging.
Second, in surviving nhr-49(nr2041) adults, sperm were strongly attracted to the proximal oocyte, whereas in WT animals in the reproductive dia-pause, sperm were primarily confined to the sper-matheca (fig.
S5, C to E).
Finally, nhr-49(nr2041) animals were severely impaired in their ability to recover from starvation and produce offspring (Fig.5C and table S2).
Two days after rescue of starved nhr-49(nr2041) adults, the uterus of these mutants was filled with cellular debris, and yolk-like material was present throughout the body cavity (Fig.5E and fig.
S6C).
The rate of cell death in nhr-49(nr2041) mutants was compara-ble to that of WTanimals, however, implying that the accumulation of cellular debris is likely to be a consequence of impaired autophagy or phago-cytic mechanisms normally required for main-taining a clean proximal gonad (Fig.5, B and D, and fig.
S6D).
The fact that nhr-49(nr2041) mutants could not properly mediate ARD entry brought up the question of whether the loss of nhr-49 function and poor ARD establishment would also inter-fere with the protection of GSCs.
However, we found that nhr-49 and normal ARD establish-ment were not required for the survival of GSCs and for their ability to proliferate upon recovery from starvation (Fig.5, D and E, and figs.
S5G and S6C), implying that these components of the ARD are separable from the NHR-49mediated mechanism that facilitates ARD establishment.
It is clear that NHR-49 mediates numerous changes in glucose and fat metabolism upon starvation; how NHR-49 senses these changes and responds is not yet understood (21, 22).
The Drosophila homolog of NHR-49, HNF-4a, has been shown to interact with free fatty acids re-leased from lipases immediately after the initiation of starvation (23).
Given the strong homology of these two NRs both in structure and in function, it is likely that a similar mechanism occurs in C. elegans.
Consequently, we expect that lipases and the upstream signals that activate lipases in response to starvation will also be key features in this overall signaling network.
Recent studies have shown that GSC arrest leads to the activation of lipid hydrolysis in C. elegans (24).
Discussion.
We have shown that the initiation of ARD enables the formation of a starvation-resistant adult that can extend reproductive po-tential for at least 30 days.
Based on our findings, we propose a disposable germline hypothesis: As ARD progresses, nutrient deprivation leads to a loss of oocytes and meiotic germ cell nuclei.
Meanwhile, a small population of mitotic germ cells is maintained in the stem cell niche in quiescence or self-renewal.
Mitotic germ cells in general are protected from apoptosis in the C. elegans germ line (15).
Because these cells are generally held inmitosis byNotch signaling from the stem cell niche, we predict a role for Notch signaling in ARD (15, 16).
In support of this hypothesis, a Plag-2::GFP (P, promoter; GFP, green fluorescent protein) promoter shows that expression of the lag-2 gene, which encodes the Notch ligand necessary for inhibiting exit from mitosis, is expressed at high levels even after 90 days of starvation (fig.
S3).
We also predict that autophagy and/or phagocytosis of apoptotic germ cells provides fuel necessary for supporting viability during starvation.
As awhole, this model implies that worms have adapted a mechanism to exploit differentiated germ cells for fuel while preserving pluripotent stem cells for tissue regeneration when conditions improve.
Although the ecological advantage of the ARD is not yet clear, we suggest that this alternative diapausemay exist because it is specially adapted to survive starvation in environmental contexts where the dauer diapause is not as effective, or it functions simply as an added layer of protec-tion against harsh environmental conditions.
Like the C. elegans dauer diapause, our results show that ARD is dependent on population density, implying that pheromones and/or other signals may also be an important part of this process.
However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that a crowded population facilitates ARD by depleting important nutrients from the growth media.
The effect of ARD on the reproductive sys-tem is quite distinct from the prevailingmodels of the impact of caloric restriction on somatic cells, which posit that reduced calorie intake leads to slowing of somatic cell aging (9).
We have ob-served here that starvation of adult C. elegans leads to a reversal of the aging process in the reproductive system, because a new differentiated germ line is regenerated when food is restored.
Our characterization of this reproductive diapause presents C. elegans as a model for this process and for understanding how stem cells and their host tissues survive and recover from prolonged periods of nutrient deprivation.
Studies in fruit flies show that this phenomenon may be con-served across metazoan species, because nutrient deprivation leads to changes in germline prolif-eration and apoptosis in Drosophila (25, 26).
Vitamin A levels can control GSC death and proliferation in rodent testes in a process that may mirror that of germline plasticity in C. elegans ARD (27).
Finally, starvation of cultured cancer cell lines results in the death of differentiated cancer cells, whereas side populations of cancer stem cells survive (28).
Altogether these findings suggest a provocative mechanism for how calor-ically restricted animals in general, including mammals, may extend their reproductive period (29), and we expect that studies of the C. elegans ARD will reveal essential factors involved in somatic cell and GSC aging, as well as factors involved in controlling germline resurrection in response to nutritional signals.
Our implication of NHR-49 reveals a NR important for robust ARD establishment, and our characterization of a ced-3 mutant reveals an important role for apoptosis in ARD maintenance and recovery.
