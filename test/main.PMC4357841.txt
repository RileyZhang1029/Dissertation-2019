Therefore, factors that are employed for cellular reprogramming in order to induce pluripotency have been identiﬁed mainly from embryonic stem cell (ESC)-enriched and pluripotency-associated factors.
Recently, lineage speciﬁers have been identiﬁed to play important roles in orchestrating the process of restoring pluripotency. In this review, we summarize the latest discoveries regarding cell fate conversion using pluripotency-associated factors and lineage speciﬁers. We highlight the value of the  seesaw  model in deﬁning cellular identity, opening up a novel scenario to consider pluri- potency and lineage speciﬁcation. Understanding how cellular identity is established is a major goal for modern biology.
The programming and reprogram- ming of cellular identity elicit tremendous scientiﬁc and public interest.

By transducing all 24 candidate genes together, G418- resistant colonies were generated by using Fbx15bgeo/bgeo as a selection marker for pluripotency. These cells were further identiﬁed to possess ESC properties.
To determine which of the 24 candidates were essential, Yamanaka and his colleagues tested the effects of the withdrawal of individual factors from the 24-candidate gene pool on the generation of G418-resistant colonies.
Ultimately Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc were identi- ﬁed to be pivotal for the induction of pluripotency in mouse somatic cells [1]. Furthermore, these factors were proven to be able to induce pluripotency in human somatic cells as well [5]. Other laboratories have also been working on inducing plu- ripotency in somatic cells.
By using Lin28 and Nanog together with Oct4 and Sox2, the Thomson laboratory also indepen- dently discovered a set of four reprogramming factors that are highly enriched in ESCs [6]. These ﬁrst proof-of-principle studies opened the realms of iPSC research to a future in regenerative medicine.
Discovering novel pluripotency regulators for the induction of pluripotency It is coherent to test whether there are novel ESC-associated factors that can regulate iPSC induction.
Several reports have suggested factors that are important for the maintenance of ESC identity can also facilitate the induction of pluripotency. For example, Nr5a2, an orphan nuclear receptor that is en- riched in ESCs, can replace Oct4 in the induction of pluripo- tency [7]. Esrrb, another orphan nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of pluripotency, can replace Klf4 and c-Myc [8]. PRDM14 and NFRKB were identiﬁed as novel determinants of human ESC identity and can substitute for Klf4 in reprogramming [9]. Recently, by a single-cell anal- ysis of the reprogramming process, Lin28, Sall4, Esrrb and Dppa2 were identiﬁed as a completely novel set of reprogram- ming factors [10], which are different from the factors initially identiﬁed by Yamanaka et al. These factors are all important for the maintenance of ESC identity [10]. In addition to the highly expressed factors in ESCs, the maternal factor Glis1 in oocytes was reported to be a novel facilitator of reprogram- ming [11]. Direct reprogramming into iPSCs by lineage speciﬁers For years, it was generally believed that ESCs are maintained by a shield of pluripotency factors.
These factors function in concert with each other to prevent ESCs from differentiating into any lineage, thus preserving the ESCs at an undifferenti- ated state [12,13]. A more challenging perspective has been put forward recently.
Pluripotency factors might as well func- tion as classical lineage speciﬁers that direct ESCs to differen- tiate into a speciﬁc lineage and inhibit their commitment to mutually exclusive lineages [14]. Consistent with the notion, in ESCs, Oct4 promotes the differentiation of mesendoderm (ME) and primitive endoderm, while suppressing differentiation of the ectoderm (ECT) [15 17] Sox2 inhibits ME differentiation but promotes neural ECT differentiation [16,17]. Shu et al. provided the ﬁrst proof- of-principle report showing that modulating lineage-specifying forces can restore the pluripotency of mouse somatic cells [18]. When screening for factors that may substitute for Oct4 in the induction of pluripotency, Shu et al. found that GATA3, which is known to regulate ME commitment and speciﬁcation, can substitute for Oct4. Subsequent analysis of other lineage speciﬁers that mainly function in ME differentiation and early embryonic patterning, which are generally not enriched in ESCs, found that GATA6, SOX7 and PAX1, among others, were also able to substitute for Oct4 to induce pluripotency, whereas ectodermal speciﬁers could not.
All Oct4 substitutes were also able to attenuate the upregulated expression of ECT-associated genes that is triggered by the expression of Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (SKM), whereas knockdown of the key ectodermal marker Dlx3 promoted SKM-only reprogram- ming [18]. These ﬁndings suggest that a novel function of Oct4/ GATA3 to during reprogramming.
suppress ECT differentiation is Accordingly, the ECT lineage speciﬁers SOX1, SOX3, RCOR2 and GMNN can replace Sox2 during reprogramming.
Similarly, Sox2 and its substitutes attenuate the expression of ME-speciﬁc markers induced by expression of Oct4, Klf4 and c-Myc (OKM) [18 20]. Strikingly, co-expression of GATA6 and GMNN can substitute for Oct4 and Sox2 to reprogram mouse ﬁbroblasts into iPSCs in the presence of Klf4 and c- Myc [18]. More recently, Montserrat et al. showed that lineage speci- ﬁers can also be used to reprogram human ﬁbroblasts into iPS- Cs.
The authors found that GATA3 can replace OCT4 and the ECT speciﬁer, ZNF521, can replace SOX2. Lastly, they showed that GATA3, together with ZNF521, OTX2 and PAX6, can substitute for both OCT4 and SOX2 for human iPSC induction in the presence of KLF4 and c-MYC [21]. A  seesaw  model for cell fate conversion A binodal model for cell fate determination, such as GATA1 and PU.1, RUNX2 and PPARc, has been examined in various instances of pluripotent stem or progenitor cells that assume a binary cell fate decision [22]. Such circuit hints at the concept of a  balanced pluripotent state.
Inspired by these insights, Shu et al. proposed a new model, termed the  seesaw  model, in which the pluripotent state has a precarious balancing equi- librium that results from continuous mutual competition be- tween rival lineage speciﬁcation forces (Figure 1). This model comprises two coupled modules  the canonical pluripotency module and the lineage-antagonism module.
The former mod- ule is represented by the mutual activation of Oct4 and Sox2, whereas mutual inhibition of the ME and ECT genes repre- sents the latter module [18]. Both the canonical pluripotency module and the lineage- antagonism module are incorporated leading into the integrated  seesaw  model.
The novelty of the  seesaw  model is the proper combination of the two modules.
This model led to unexpected insights and scenarios of cell fate conversion.
The activation of the cross-activating pluripotency module is important for the reestablishment of the pluripotency network to achieve successful reprogramming.
The self-activating pluripotency module gets activated when all of lineage-specifying forces are the  Shu J and Deng H / Lineage Speciﬁers in the Induction of Pluripotency 261 Lineage A inducer (e.g., ME inducer) Pluripotent state Pluripotent state Pluripotent state Lineage B inducer (e.g., ECT inducer) Pluripotent state Lineage B inhibitor (e.g., ECT inhibitor) Pluripotent state Lineage A inducer (e.g., ME inducer) Lineage B inducer (e.g., ECT inducer) Lineage A inhibitor (e.g., ME inhibitor) Pluripotent state i L n e a g e A  s t   a t e i L n e a g e B  s t   t a e l P u r i p o e n t Lineage A inhibitor (e.g., ME inhibitor) Lineage B inhibitor (e.g., ECT inhibitor) t  s t a t e Figure 1 A  seesaw  model for cell fate conversion A modiﬁed diagram of the  seesaw  model [18].

The pluripotent state (red ball) is located near the balance region.
When the seesaw is balanced between the two differentiation potentials, the cell has a higher probability of entering the pluripotent state.

In other words, no particular lineage-specifying activity is dominant in inhibiting the pluripotency module.
In this case, the pluripo- tent state becomes achievable, eliciting the Oct4 and Sox2 self- activating module to coordinate with other pluripotency factors, thus collaboratively restoring the pluripotency network.
Once the cross-activating pluripotency module is activated, the ME and ECT lineage fates are blocked by Sox2 and Oct4, respec- tively. As a result, the pluripotent state is maintained [18]. This innovative model can illustrate the aforementioned points and predicts novel strategies for cell fate conversion, including strategies for the direct conversion of somatic cells into iPSCs by pluripotency factors or lineage speciﬁers along with the direct conversion of somatic cells into speciﬁc lineages by lineage speciﬁers or pluripotency factors.
Direct reprogramming into other cell types by lineage speciﬁers or pluripotency factors The direct reprogramming strategy for cell fate conversion has been widely adapted for some other cell types in addition to iPSCs. The direct conversion of ﬁbroblasts into myoblasts by over- expressing MyoD was reported in 1987 by Davis and colleagues [23]. Recently, increasing numbers of different cell types have been obtained by direct conversion, termed transdifferentiation. For example, a combination of three neuronal lineage-speciﬁc tran- scription factors, Ascl1, Brn2 and Mytl1, is sufﬁcient to induce neurons from ﬁbroblasts [24]. The cardiac-speciﬁc transcription factors Gata4, Tbx5 and Mef2c can induce ﬁbroblast transdiffer- entiation into cardiomyocytes [25]. It is therefore assumed that the more speciﬁc and closer the endogenous regulatory network is to the factors, the more efﬁcient the conversion will be [26]. The  seesaw  model also predicts that inhibiting the mu- tual antagonistic lineage-specifying forces could convert one cell type into another.
Furthermore, consistent with the  seesaw  model, repro- gramming factors have been reported to directly produce line- age-committed cells.
Two pivotal pluripotency factors, Oct4 and Sox2, were reported to regulate ESC differentiation into different germ layers and to induce direct conversions between different cell types beyond iPSCs. Previous studies have shown that a twofold increase in Oct4 expression induces ESCs toward mesendodermal speciﬁcation [15], whereas high levels of Sox2 trigger the neuroectodermal commitment of ESCs. Recently, it was reported that Oct4 and Sox2 also orchestrate a germ-layer fate selection.
Oct4 inhibits neuroectodermal differentiation and promotes mesen- dodermal differentiation, whereas Sox2 promotes neuroecto- dermal inhibits mesendodermal differentiation [16,17]. differentiation and More recently, overexpression of Oct4 in ﬁbroblasts was shown to lead to transdifferentiation into hematopoietic cells of a mesendodermal lineage [27], whereas overexpression of Sox2 directly converted ﬁbroblasts into neural stem cells.
Additionally, decreased expression of Oct4 among the four Yamanaka factors can result in the direct conversion of ﬁbro- blasts into neural stem cells [28 30]. These discoveries suggest that pluripotency factors, such as Oct4 and Sox2, can regulate not only pluripotency but also lineage speciﬁcation. Conclusion and outlook After the discovery of the famous Yamanaka factors, a set of transcription factors consisting of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and  262 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 259 263 scenario for cell fate conversion causing us c-Myc, regenerative biology has stepped into a new era.
Increasing numbers of pluripotency-related factors have been identiﬁed either to replace the Yamanaka factors or to boost the process.
Meanwhile, direct transdifferentiation has been successfully demonstrated through a similar strategy, by using lineage-speciﬁc transcription factors for specifying each lineage fate.
Recently, discoveries and notions related to the  seesaw  model for cell fate conversion have introduced a novel to re-evaluate the characteristics of pluripotency factors and lineage speciﬁers, which are two rivals in the conventional conception of the development of cellular identity.
Increasing evidence suggests that pluripotency factors are also lineage speciﬁers. For example, Oct4 speciﬁes ME differentiation while inhibiting ECT differentiation, and induces hematopoi- etic transdifferentiation from ﬁbroblasts. Sox2 directs ECT differentiation while prohibiting ME commitment, and in- duces direct transdifferentiation from ﬁbroblasts into neural stem cells.
Overexpression of Nanog, Esrrb, or Tbx3 pro- motes mesendodermal determination [14]. Lastly, the lineage speciﬁers depicted as pluripotency rivals, such as GATA3 and PAX6, have been identiﬁed to be able to restore pluripo- tency in somatic cells.
Based on these discoveries, we should reconsider the deﬁni- tions of pluripotency and lineage speciﬁcation and present a novel perspective for understanding the determinants of cellu- lar identity, which is one of the most important topics in mod- ern biology.
