While one miRNA can target many mRNAs, a single mRNA can also be targeted by a set of miRNAs. The targeted mRNAs may be involved in different bio- logical processes that are described by gene ontology (GO) terms.
The major challenges involved in analyzing these multitude regulations include identiﬁcation of the combinatorial regulation of miR- NAs as well as determination of the co-functionally-enriched miRNA pairs.
The C2Analyzer: Co- target Co-function Analyzer, is a Perl-based, versatile and user-friendly web tool with online instructions.
Based on the hypergeometric analysis, this novel tool can determine whether given pairs of miRNAs are co-functionally enriched.
For a given set of GO term(s), it can also identify the set of miRNAs whose targets are enriched in the given GO term(s). Moreover, C2Analyzer can also identify the co-targeting miRNA pairs, their targets and GO processes, which they are involved in.
The miRNA miRNA co-functional relationship can also be saved as a.txt ﬁle, which can be used to further visualize the co-functional network by using other software like Cytoscape. C2Analyzer is freely available at www.bioinformatics.org/c2analyzer.

Production and hosting by Elsevier translation [1]. Although thousands of miRNAs have been identiﬁed, the function of most miRNAs involved in biological networks remains unclear [2]. The miRNAs regulate a wide range of cellular functions, such as development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism.
It has been hypothesized that a single miR- NA can concurrently down-regulate hundreds of target mRNAs [3] and thus affect the expression of numerous genes at one time.
Functionally related genes are usually regulated by a group of miRNAs instead of one miRNA. The down-reg- ulation of a candidate target by a set of miRNAs depends on how many and which miRNAs are expressed in the cell at a given time.
However, recent studies indicate that a relatively small number of miRNAs can set up remarkably complex 1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2014 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

This combinatorial regulation of miRNAs in any species is common and studying the potential functional effect of such regulation is an interesting and challenging area of miRNA research.
However, the existing tools for analysis of the combi- natorial regulation have limitations.
For example, while Gene- Set2miRNA [6] can predict a group of miRNAs regulating a signiﬁcant subset of genes, the prediction of statistically enriched biological functions regulated by these miRNAs is missing in this tool.
On the other hand, CORNA [7] can be used to identify the signiﬁcant mRNA sets as well as gene ontology (GO) terms regulated by a single miRNA. However, it is not possible to get a list of signiﬁcant mRNAs or GO terms that are co-targeted by a pair of miRNAs using CORNA. It has been demonstrated that the analysis of co-targeting and co-functional miRNA pairs can generate the functional modules, which can further establish the synergistic behavior of miRNAs [8]. Here, synergistic effect is considered when at least one functional module (i.e., GO) is signiﬁcantly co-tar- geted by a pair of miRNAs. For a given set of input data (miR- NA mRNA and mRNA GO process), our recently-developed C2Analyzer reported in the present study can identify (i) the statistically signiﬁcant co-functional miRNA pairs, their tar- gets and GO processes involved and (ii) a candidate set of miRNAs whose targets are enriched in the given GO terms.
In addition, users can also obtain some straightforward results showing the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships among the miRNA mRNA GO terms.
Methods C2Analyzer requires two ﬁles as input: one mapping the miRNAs to the target genes and the other mapping each gene to the GO IDs that it belongs to.
The tool can perform ﬁve types of analysis starting from these two ﬁles (see Fig- ure 1 and output section). The main objectives are to (i) iden- tify the targets shared by two miRNAs and ﬁnd the GO terms that are enriched in these targets and (ii) identify the miRNAs with enriched targets associated with a set of GO terms.
In addition, the tool can also be used to (iii) identify the mRNAs and their GO terms associated with a list of miRNAs, (iv) identify the miRNAs targeting a given set of       Ti t S  Ti L  t S X n t¼0 mRNAs and (v) identify the mRNAs that are co-targeted by a given set of miRNAs. Identiﬁcation of co-functionally signiﬁcant miRNA pairs We have identiﬁed each miRNA pair and their co-targeting mRNAs as a target subset and candidate functional modules in the target subset by performing functional enrichment in each biological process category.
For a given miRNA pair of M1 and M2, we identify the target subset they co-target (M1 \ M2). The subset must contain a minimum number of target genes (i.e., Omin). Here, the value of Omin is set to 3 [8]. First, biological processes where the target subset is enriched are identiﬁed by hypergeometric distribution.
The probability PGi for M1 \ M2 in the GO term i is calculated according to the equation used in [8],   PGi ¼ 1  FðnjS Ti LÞ ¼ 1  L where S is the number of all targets (default background distri- bution), Ti is the total number of genes that are annotated in the GO term i and targeted by miRNAs, L is the size of M1 \ M2, n is the number of targets in M1 \ M2 that are also annotated to term i.
Here, i = 1, 2,....., I and I is the total number of GO terms that we considered.
At the given signiﬁcance level, we can obtain not only the set with enriched function terms but also capture the set GOM1M2 with the subsets in M1 \ M2 that are annotated to each term in the previous set.
Namely, GOM1M2 is the set of candidate functional modules.
Next, the functional modules in GOM1M2 are identiﬁed. After performing the func- tion enrichment, M1 and M2 are considered to be synergistic if they co-target at least one functional module.
Identiﬁcation of the miRNAs associated with a set of GO terms To identify the miRNAs whose targets are enriched in the given GO ID(s), the chi-square test is performed.

Aftabuddin M et al / Co-target Co-function Analysis 135 and analysis time depends on the size of input ﬁles. This tool is developed using Perl CGI and is hosted on an Apache web server.
The web pages are designed with HTML. Web interface Input User can upload their own data as two relation ﬁles (two column data separated by tab). One is miRNA vs. target mRNA, and the other is target mRNA vs. GO process.
Test sample datasets are provided for the users.
Users can create these ﬁles by following the instructions given in the online documentation section.
Output The miRNA miRNA co-functional relationship ﬁle can be saved as a.txt ﬁle, which can be further utilized to visualize the co-functional network in Cytoscape like software.
Output for other types of analysis can be saved as.csv format.
The following types of analysis could be done by C2Analyzer. mRNA co-targeted by miRNA set With a given set of miRNAs, users will get a set of mRNAs co-targeted by all of the input miRNAs. Co-functionally signiﬁcant miRNA pair Here, users can get two types of output with a given set of miRNAs. First, users can get a set of GO terms that are regu- lated by miRNA pairs.
Second, the tool can also perform hypergeometric analysis to identify set of GO(s) with enriched targets regulated by miRNA pairs.
Users can set the P value (the default value is 0.05). miRNA set regulating GO A user can determine a set of miRNAs that are involved in a single GO process.
Further, the tool can also identify a set of miRNAs that regulate a set of GO processes with enriched targets.
For the latter case, the chi-square test is performed and the user can choose the P value cut-off.
mRNA and GO targeted by miRNA For a single miRNA, the output can generate two tables: one describing a list of mRNAs and the other showing a list of GO IDs targeted by this miRNA. miRNA set targeting mRNAs For a given set of mRNAs, the user can get the individual lists of miRNAs targeting each of these mRNAs. The user can also obtain a common list of miRNAs co-targeting all of the mRNAs given as input.
Case study Here we present an example to illustrate the use of C2Analyzer to identify the co-functionally signiﬁcant miRNA pairs.
A sub- set of cadmium induced-miRNAs in the rice plant collected from literature [9] was used for this analysis.
We took four miRNAs, namely osa-miR156l, osa-miR156k, osa-miR156a and osa-miR162a, which were reported to be down-regulated due to cadmium stress [9]. C2Analyzer is able to ﬁnd target mRNAs and a list of GOs regulated by all possible pairwise combinations of these four miRNAs. Moreover, based on hypergeometric distribution analysis, the tool is also able to identify a list of signiﬁcantly- enriched GOs for every possible pair of miRNAs. For example, the miRNA pair osa-miR156a/k can co-target 11 mRNAs (Table 1) and thus can co-regulate a total number of 13 biolog- ical functions (GO). While C2Analyzer is used to identify the GOs in which the miRNA targets are signiﬁcantly enriched (P  0.05), we get only 4 GO processes (Table 2). The four GO processes identiﬁed are GO:0003677 (DNA binding, molec- ular function), GO:0008270 (zinc ion binding, molecular func- tion), GO:0046872 (metal ion binding, molecular function) Table 1 Co-targeted mRNAs by miRNA pair osa-miR156a/k and the related GOs Common mRNA set GO LOC_Os01g69830.1 LOC_Os02g04680.1 LOC_Os02g04680.2 LOC_Os02g07780.1 LOC_Os02g07780.2 LOC_Os06g45310.1 LOC_Os07g32170.1 LOC_Os08g39890.1 LOC_Os08g41940.1 LOC_Os09g31438.1 GO:0003677, GO:0005634 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 GO:0003677, GO:0005634 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 GO:0003677, GO:0005634 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 GO:0003677, GO:0005634, GO:0008270, GO:0046872 Table 2 Signiﬁcantly-enriched GOs and mRNA sets co-targeted by miRNA pair osa-miR156a/k GO GO:0003677 GO:0005634 GO:0008270 GO:0046872 mRNA set LOC_Os01g69830.1, LOC_Os02g04680.1, LOC_Os02g04680.2, LOC_Os02g07780.1, LOC_Os02g07780.2, LOC_Os06g45310.1, LOC_Os07g32170.1, LOC_Os08g39890.1, LOC_Os08g41940.1, LOC_Os09g31438.1 LOC_Os01g69830.1, LOC_Os02g04680.1, LOC_Os02g04680.2, LOC_Os02g07780.1, LOC_Os02g07780.2, LOC_Os06g45310.1, LOC_Os07g32170.1, LOC_Os08g39890.1, LOC_Os08g41940.1, LOC_Os09g31438.1 LOC_Os02g04680.1, LOC_Os02g07780.1, LOC_Os06g45310.1, LOC_Os07g32170.1, LOC_Os08g39890.1, LOC_Os08g41940.1, LOC_Os09g31438.1 LOC_Os02g04680.1, LOC_Os02g07780.1, LOC_Os06g45310.1, LOC_Os07g32170.1, LOC_Os08g39890.1, LOC_Os08g41940.1, LOC_Os09g31438.1 Note: Signiﬁcantly-enriched GOs were determined using hypergeo- metric test (P  0.05). 136 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 133 136 and GO:0005634 (nucleus, cellular component). The enriched targets (LOC_Os01g69830.1, LOC_Os02g07780.1, etc.) within these four GOs are annotated as SBP-box genes.
It is of note that SBP-box genes encode transcription factors, and GO:0003677 has DNA binding function.
It is also known that the SBP-box proteins regulate some stress-responsive genes and thus play important roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis [10]. The cadmium is a metal ion with strong afﬁnity for oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.
Thus, it can inhibit the enzymatic activity by directly blocking protein functions or altering the natural metal centers [11]. To maintain the cellular homeostasis, the cell may overpro- duce the genes having metal ion binding functionality.
Since expression of miRNAs osa-miR156a and osa-mir156k was down-regulated due to cadmium stress [9], their targets, i.e., the SBP-box genes, must have higher expression presumably.
Interestingly, one of the enriched molecular functions of the SBP-box genes as annotated in the GO process is metal ion bind- ing (GO:0046872). Thus, this combinatorial regulation may be one of the mechanisms to maintain the cellular homeostasis under cadmium stress.
Future development We plan to upgrade the current web-based tool as well as to incorporate several existing datasets. For example, in the future, condition-speciﬁc miRNAs and gene expression data will be included.
The necessary tools for analyzing expression data will also be added to analyze and integrate the expression dataset. Conclusion that uses two input ﬁles Here we have developed a user-friendly web-tool, C2Ana- lyzer, (miRNA mRNA and mRNA GO) to identify (i) co-functionally signiﬁcant miR- NA pair, (ii) miRNA set regulating GO processes with enriched targets, (iii) mRNA and GO targeted by miRNA, (iv) miRNA set targeting mRNA and (v) mRNA co-targeted by miRNA set.
C2Analyzer can also be used to analyze datasets for any organism.
Our results also indicate that C2Analyzer may help elucidate the functions of some functionally-unidentiﬁed miRNAs. As the number of newly-identiﬁed miRNAs is growing day by day, the web tool will be helpful for their functional analysis.
Finally, we want to mention that this web-based tool is ﬂexible to analyze the general relationship among X, Y and Z with two given input ﬁles describing X Y and Y Z relationships.
For example, if the user provides miRNA gene and gene disease ﬁles, this tool can ﬁnd the relationship between miR- NA and disease as well.
