BIOINFORMATICS APPLICATIONS NOTE Vol.25 no.7 2009, pages 958 959 doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp086 Genome analysis CGAS: comparative genomic analysis server Masumi Itoh and Hidemi Watanabe  Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0814, Japan Received on September 30, 2008 revised on February 10, 2009 accepted on February 11, 2009 Advance Access publication February 13, 2009 Associate Editor: Alex Bateman ABSTRACT Summary: Comparative approach is one of the most essential methods for extracting functional and evolutionary information from genomic sequences.
So far, a number of sequence comparison tools have been developed, and most are either for on-site use, requiring program installation but providing a wide variety of analyses, or for the online search of user s sequences against given databases on a server.
We newly devised an Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax)-based system for comparative genomic analyses, CGAS, with highly interactive interface within a browser, requiring no software installation.
The current version, CGAS version 1, provides functionality for viewing similarity relationships between user s sequences, including a multiple dot plot between sequences with their annotation information.
The scrollbar-less draggable interface of CGAS is implemented with Google Maps API version 2.
The annotation information associated with the genomic sequences compared is synchronously displayed with the comparison view.
The multiple-comparison viewer is one of the unique functionalities of this system to allow the users to compare the differences between different pairs of sequences.
In this viewer, the system tells orthologous correspondences between the sequences compared interactively.
This web-based tool is platform-independent and will provide biologists having no computational skills with opportunities to analyze their own data without software installation and customization of the computer system.

Conservation patterns along genome sequences are well studied with comparative genomics tools, including MultiPipMaker (Schwartz et al., 2003) and the UCSC genome browser (Karolchik et al., 2008). However, these tools do not directly show the collinearity between the sequences compared, although it information source about genome evolution, such as duplication, inversion, translocation, insertion and deletion.
Collinearity is also known as an evolutionary signal of orthology (von Mering et al., 2003). is an important   To whom correspondence should be addressed.
To view the collinearity between sequences, we usually use a 2D representation, called dot plot or Harr plot, or a synteny map.
A number of tools to draw a dot plot have been developed (e.g. Abril et al., 2003 Schwartz et al., 2000 Sonnhammer and Durbin, 1995 Wilson et al., 2001), but except a few, e.g. Dotter (Sonnhammer and Durbin, 1995), they do not provide interactive zooming, windowing and/or scrolling functionality.
These functions are very useful when we explore a huge dot plot between big sequences like eukaryote chromosomes to identify evolutionary changes.
For identiﬁcation of such changes, the annotation data of and other associating data with the sequences involved in the changes may be a good help.
Some interactive dot plot tools show annotation data of the sequences (Engels et al., 2006 Jareborg and Durbin, 2000 Wilson et al., 2001), but they are on-site programs, i.e. the users should install them on the platforms that the developers specify.
Here, we newly developed a comparative genomic analysis server, CGAS for viewing similarity relationships between user s sequences with their annotation information.
The Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or Ajax technology is integrated into this system to provide a dynamic and user-intuitive interface, which allows the users to interactively compare sequences, viewing the annotation data of the sequences.
This system does not require installation of any programs but just a web browser that understands JavaScript. to the server FEATURES AND USAGE 2 The main page of the CGAS consists of the interactive comparison and annotation panes (Fig. 1A). Users may upload their BLAST outputs (Altschul et al., 1997) to view the alignments between the query and the subject sequences.
The server automatically generates a dot plot of the alignments.
The comparison pane displays the hits between the query and a subject in a 2D representation.
Annotation panes are placed along the left and the upper edges of the comparison pane.
They display the annotation data of the query and the subject graphically.
User-deﬁned annotation data may be uploaded in the gbk/gbff (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html) or the (http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml). gff data In the case where the sequence names in the uploaded alignment data are recognized as those deﬁned at NCBI, the system automatically fetches the annotation data from NCBI through the TogoWS system (http://togows.dbcls.jp/). format Users can move about the entire dot plot by dragging the comparison pane and zoom it in/out with the mouse wheel in the same manner as the Google Maps.

A B CGAS Fig.1.
The main page of CGAS, consisting with comparison and annotation panes.
This example shows a comparison of the regions including the opsin loci in the X chromosomes of human and chimpanzee (A: single mode) and macaque (B: dual mode). Red and blue dots/lines in the comparison pane represent the BLAST hits in the same/different directions between the query and the subject.
at the upper-left corner of the comparison pane, may be used to navigate.
Diagonal movements are possible using the navigation controls.
Thanks to the Google Maps API, the annotation panes are updated synchronously with the comparison pane.
The names of the annotated objects are shown in a small box, which can be expanded by moving the mouse cursor on it and shows annotation details along with the link to the original data at NCBI. If the mouse cursor is within the comparison pane, the position of the cursor in each of the query and the subject(s) is indicated by a red thin line in the annotation pane with the position information in base pairs.
The current version of CGAS is capable of displaying two subjects side by side (Fig. 1B). Two comparison panes are synchronously aligned to the query.
This functionality allows the users to compare the differences in collinearity between the subjects.
CGAS provides a unique function to align the query and the subject annotation panes based on the putative orthology relationships between the sequences compared.
If the user double- clicks in the subject or query panes, the most similar region of the clicked region in the query or subject sequence is centered in the pane, and the comparison pane is updated accordingly.
This is useful for tracking the signiﬁcant hits.
The uploaded data are indexed with user s login ID and retained in the server for a week after the last access or until the user deletes them.
IMPLEMENTATION 3 The CGAS is a web server with the Ruby on Rails framework with JavaScript. The interface within the dot plot viewer and the annotation viewer was implemented using Google Maps API version 2.
Interpretation of biological data and interactive entry fetching from public database were achieved by the BioRuby library (http://bioruby.org/) and the TogoWS system.
