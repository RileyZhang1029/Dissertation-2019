Here we describe a case of primary bilateral breast BL presenting during lactation in a 23-year-old woman.
Excisional biopsy of breastmasses demonstrated a B-cell lymphomawith a characteristic starry sky pattern highly suggestive of BL.
The neoplastic cells strongly expressed CD20 and CD10, and showed proliferative activity as measured by Ki-67.
An IGH-MYC gene fusion indicating the presence of a typical Burkitt translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) in the tumor tissue was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization.
The present case, along with a comprehensive review of the literature, demonstrates that BL of the breast should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions of the breast during lactation.
Whether hormonal or antigenic factors trigger Burkitt lymphomagenesis in the lactating breast warrants further investigation.
1.
Introduction Primary breast lymphoma is a rare form of localized, extra nodal, malignant lymphoma,[1-3] constituting 2% of extranodal malignant lymphomas, with an overall incidence of 0.040.53% of all malignant tumors of the breast.
[4-6] Most primary breast lymphomas are of B-cell origin, and the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas seem to be the most common type.
[2,5,7-10] Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a malignancy arising from mature B-cell lymphocytes and is one of the most rapidly proliferating neo plasms, with a doubling time of only about 25 hours.
It often presents in extranodal sites or as acute leukemia.
[11,12] Primary presentation of BL in the breasts is rare as com pared with the typical presentation sites, which are the ileocecal region in sporadic and endemic BL and, additionally, the jaws in endemic BL.
[2,13] If the onset of BL is in the breast, then it is often bilateral and massive and is usually associated with pregnancy or lactation, which might suggest hormonal influ ences on its pathogenesis.
[11] In the present study, we report a new case of bilateral breast BL and provide an analytic review of all eligible, previously reported studies to ascertain the pa tients clinical findings, characteristics, and treatment outcome.

Case Report A 23-year-old woman presented with palpable, painful, and rapidly diffusible bilateral breast swelling, 3 months after de livery.
She was able to breastfeed her healthy child.
She had no pastmedical problems, and her vital signs were normal.
She had CASE REPORT Mol Diagn Ther 2010; 14 (4): 243-2501177-1062/10/0004-0243/$49.95/0 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

no family history of lymphoma or other cancer.
There was no erythema or bloody discharge.
The patients biochemical and hematologic examinations (including a complete blood count, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and sodium) were within normal limits.
The erythrocyte sed imentation rate was about 104mm/h.
On physical examination, there were multiple mobile, discrete, smooth, non-tender, and firm nodules in both breasts.
The axillary and cervical lymph nodes were not palpable.
Bilateral breast ultrasonography showed numerous, varia ble sized (24 cm), well defined, discrete, echo-poor lesions, some of which demonstrated a heterogenous internal echogenic echotexture, more suggestive of abscess formation or galacto cele.
There was no lymphadenopathy, solid mass, free fluid, or skin edema in the ultrasonography findings.
The patient underwent excisional biopsy of bilateral breast masses under general anesthesia.
Grossly, the tumors consisted of irregular fragments of creamy-gray to yellow soft tissues, measuring 5 3 2.1 cm in the right breast and 2.5 2 1.5 cm in the left breast.
Multiple cut sections showed a partially ho mogenous, creamy-gray appearance.
Histologic examination revealed lactational breast tissue re placed by a high-grade lymphoma, with a characteristic starry sky pattern highly suggestive of BL (figure 1).
The lymphoid cells were small to medium sized, with slightly irregular round nuclei.
The nuclei contained finely clumped and dispersed chromatin, with multiple prominent basophilic medium-sized nucleoli (figure 1 inset).
The cytoplasm was markedly baso philic.
Numerous mitoses were observed.
Immunohistochemistry was performed, using a polymer detection system and with primary monoclonal antibodies.
Appropriate positive and negative controls were included.
The neoplastic cells strongly expressed CD20 (clone L26; Novo castra, Newcastle, UK), CD10 (clone 56C6; Novocastra), and B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 (clone LN22; Novocastra).
Almost 100% of the tumor cells showed proliferative activity and expressed Ki-67 (clone MM1; Novocastra) [figure 2].
They were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [clone SEN28; Novocastra], CD23 (clone 1B12; Novocastra), CD5 (clone 4C7; Novocastra), BCL2 (clone bcl-2/100/D5; Novocastra), estrogen receptor-a (clone 6F11; Novocastra), and progesterone receptor-a (clone 16; Novocastra).
By in situ hybridization with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded RNA (EBER) probe, there was no evidence of EBV.
Interphase cytogenetic analysis by fluorescence in situ hybrid ization was performed on paraffin sections of the tumor cells, using LSIMYCBreakApart andLSI IGH/MYC double color double fusion probes (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Approximately 90% of the cells in the tumor tissue displayed signal patterns indicating a chromosomal breakpoint in theMYC locus (figure 2 inset) and an IGH/MYC fusion as characteristic of the typical Burkitt translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32).
Based on routine histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic examinations, a final diagnosis of Burkitt lympho ma of the breast was made.

Mol Diagn Ther 2010; 14 (4) bone marrow examination) and imaging studies (including chest radiography, CT scanning, and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography) revealed no involvement of the other organs, and confirmed the breast as the primary site of disease.
Combination chemotherapy using a regimen of bleomycin 10U/m2, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2, doxorubicin 50mg/m2, vincristine 1.4mg/m2, and prednisolone 100mg (BACOP) was considered for the patient.
Four weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy, the disease recurred in the left breast and was diagnosed with fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
The Wright stained smears showed monomorphic, medium-sized, atypical, non-cleaved-type lymphoid cells with multiple nucleoli.
The cytoplasm was moderate in amount, with fine vacuoles con taining lipid (figure 3).
Mitoses were present, with numerous tingible body macrophages.
Because these findings suggested progression of the BL under therapy, the treatment regimen was changed to rituximab plus intensive chemotherapy com bined with aggressive central nervous system therapy, using a dose-modified cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (CODOX-M)/ifosfamide, mesna, etoposide, and cytarabine (IVAC) regimen.
[14] The patient died 6 months after her first admission, despite chemotherapy.

Discussion BL is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma re sulting from B-lymphoid proliferation.
BL is rare, account ing for fewer than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults.
[12,15] Primary non-Hodgkin breast lymphoma itself ac counts for fewer than 1% of all breast tumors and approx imately 2% of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
[6,16-18] Primary lymphoma of the breast and its extranodal spread to the breast as a result of systemic lymphoma are recognized, albeit uncommon, conditions.
[3] BL of the breast is a specific and rare clinical manifestation of the disease, with a rapid spread and a poor prognosis, and it usually affects the breast of pregnant or breastfeeding patients bilaterally.
[19] Wiseman and Liao[18] reported that a diagnosis of primary malignant lymphoma of the breast must satisfy the following criteria: (i) adequate pathologic evaluation; (ii) close associa tion of both mammary tissue and lymphomatous infiltration; and (iii) exclusion of either systemic lymphoma or previous extramammary lymphoma (the presence of ipsilateral axillary node involvement is considered acceptable).
According to these standards, the tumor in our patient was considered to be pri mary BL of the breast.
We identified 28 reports (including 47 cases of BL with breast involvement) by a search of the English-language lit erature, using the term Burkitt lymphoma of breast or pri mary breast lymphoma.
Twenty-four papers reported single cases[2,3,13,15,20-39] and four studies reported 2,[40] 4,[41] 5,[42] and 12[43] patients, respectively, with BL of the breast.
Of these 47 cases, 14 occurred during the lactational period[39,42,43] and 13 occurred during pregnancy.
[15,20-22,27,30-33,35,42] The times of occurrence of the other 20 cases were not defined.
[2,3,13,23-26,28,29,34,36-38,40-42] Of these 47 cases, 32 cases occurred bilaterally, as in the present case.
[13,15,22,23,27-31,34,36,38-43] There were 27 cases of primary BL[3,24-27,33-37,40-43] and 20 cases of secondary BL of the breast.
[2,13,15,20-23,28-32,38-42] EBER in situ hybridization was done in four cases[15,33,40] and was positive in two of these.
[15,33] In two patients, the presence of EBV was confirmed by positive blood serology.
[3,15] Con ventional karyotyping was reported in only three cases and identified the typical t(8;14).
[15,20,36] Information on Burkitt lymphoma of the breast in the literature, together with this report, is summarized in table I.
According to the literature, BL in the breast seems to mostly affect young adult patients (89.3%) and rarely children in puberty (6.4%), although BL per se is much more frequent in children.
[12] Our literature review also revealed that more than 50% of reported BL cases in the breast are associated with pregnancy or lactation.
It is intriguing to speculate that this might indicate a role of hormones in the pathogenesis or could point to an antigenic stimulus in the lactating breast.
The me dian age of incidence reported in patients with BL of the breast was 30.6 years (range 1736), which is similar to the median age of the subset of patients with BL of the breast during lac tation or pregnancy (28.5 years; range 1542).

As for the outcome, the survival rates for primary BL of the breast in the lactation period and in preg nancy were 14.3% and 30.8%, respectively (p =NS).Most of the lactation-associated BLs were stage I (92.8%), whereas those occurring in pregnancy were mainly stage IV (61.5%).
Based on the literature review by Hugh et al.,[44] there are two clinicopathologic types of primary breast lymphoma.
One type affects younger patients, occurs in pregnant or lactating woman, and corresponds to BL with a rapidly fatal clinical course.
The second and more common type is unilateral at presentation and affects a broad age range, but primarily older woman.
Most lymphomas of the breast are large B-cell lymphomas and, to a lesser extent, Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphomas.
[10] The breast has been considered as a potential site of so-called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue as a low-grade B-cell lym phoma or extranodal manifestations of any systemic lympho ma (e.g.follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic leukemia/ lymphoma) or acute leukemia.
[45,46] Leukemic involvement of the breast is very rare and occurs primarily in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or, even more rarely, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
[47] T-cell non-Hodgkin lym phomas (specifically anaplastic large cell lymphoma [ALCL]; including ALK positive and ALK negative), have also been reported in the breast, mainly as the consequence of breast implants.
All patients who have ALCLwith breast involvement are CD30 positive.
[1] In conclusion, although Burkitt lymphoma is rare, it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions of the breast, particularly during pregnancy and lactation.
