a) Comparison of the genomic organization of the overlapping ATXN8 and ATXN8OS genes and 5-region of the KLHL1 gene.
Exons are shown as boxes and various alternative splice forms are indicated by dashed lines.
The murine Klhl1as transcript (a partial homolog of the much longer human ATXN8OS transcript) terminates within the Klhl1 promoter region.
The murine Klhl1as gene is much shorter than the human ATXN8OS transcript.
Interestingly, the region of human genomic DNA containing ATXN8OS exons A, B, C1, C2, and C3 is not conserved in the downstream chromosomal region of the murine Klhl1as gene.
b) Relative levels of murine Klhl1 cerebellar RNA expression were assessed by Northern analysis using a 605 bp probe spanning exons2-5 of the murine Klhl1 coding region.
Relative expression levels in non-Tg (FVB), BAC-Exp1 and BAC-Ctl3 animals are comparable.
c) Each bar represents an average of three animals with no significant differences between the BAC-Exp1 and FVB or BAC-Ctl3 animals.
