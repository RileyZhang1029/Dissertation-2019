We investigated whether the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib either alone or in combination with creatine could exert neuroprotective effects in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine model of PD in mice.
Both rofecoxib and creatine administered alone protected against striatal dopamine depletions and loss of substantia nigra tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons.
Admin-istration of rofecoxib with creatine produced significant additive neuroprotective effects against dopamine depletions.
These results suggest that a combination of a COX-2 inhibitor with creatine might be a useful neu-roprotective strategy for PD.

ISSN0895-8696/03/21:191198/$25.00 Journal of Molecular Neuroscience 191 Volume 21, 2003 Introduction Although a small number of genetic defects are associated with Parkinsons disease (PD), in most patients, the etiology is unknown.
There is increas-ing evidence that both mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory mechanisms may contribute to PD pathogenesis.
There is an increase in reactive microglia in the striatum and substantia nigra of patients with idiopathic PD (McGeer et al., 1988).
Activated microglia are also found in the substan-tia nigra of humans dying many yr after exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Langston et al., 1999).
Increased interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-concentrations are reported in the cerebrospinal fluid and striatum of PD patients (Blum-Degen et al., 1995; Mogi et al., 1996; Muller et al., 1998; Mogi et al., 1994a; Mogi et al., 1994b), and an increase in TNF-and IL-1 immunoreactive glial cells has been reported in the substantia nigra (Hunot et al., 1999).
Last, an IL-1polymorphism was reported to increase the risk of PD (McGeer et al., 2002; Schulte et al., 2002).
Defects in mitochondrial energy metabolism are also implicated in PD pathogenesis.
MPTP has been used to model PD both in mice and primates (Beal, 2001).
There is substantial evidence that MPTP tox-icity involves mitochondrial dysfunction.

Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 21, 2003 metabolized to MPP+ by monoamine oxidase B, and is then taken up by the dopamine transporter and accumulates in mitochondria, where it inhibits com-plex I of the electron transport chain (Gluck et al., 1994; Beal, 2001).
Similarly, systemic administration of the complex I inhibitor rotenone produces an animal model of PD (Betarbet et al., 2000).
We previously demonstrated that administration of creatine exerts dose-dependent neuroprotective effects against MPTP neurotoxicity (Matthews et al., 1999).
Cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 is induced by cytokines, including IL-1 and TNF-, and has been implicated in neurodegeneration in a variety of set-tings (Almer et al., 2001; Iadecola et al., 2001; Hewitt et al., 2000).
Cyclooxygenase converts arachidonic acid to PGH2, the precursor of PGE2, and several other prostanoids.
COX-1 is expressed constitutively, whereas the expression of COX-2 is induced in inflamed tissue (Smith et al., 2000).
Recently it was shown that COX-2 inhibitors exert neuroprotective effects against MPTP toxicity (Teismann et al., 2001; Teismann et al., 2003).
In the present experiments, we therefore examined whether creatine could exert additive neuroprotective effects when administered with rofecoxib, one of the two COX-2 inhibitors presently approved for use in man (Fitzgerald and Patrono, 2001).
Materials and Methods Experimental Animals Our experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals.
Male 3-mo-old Swiss-Webster mice were fed lab chow diets supplemented with 2% creatine, or 0.005% rofecoxib or their combination for 1 wk before MPTP administration.
Standard unsupplemented lab chow diet served as a control.
We examined 12 mice in each group for neurochemistry and 10 mice in each group for histology.
MPTP (20 mg/kg, 5 mL/kg, intraperi-toneally) was administered four times at 2-h inter-vals to the mice.
The animals were killed 1 wk after MPTP treatment, and both striata were rapidly dis-sected on a chilled glass plate and frozen at 70C.
The samples were subsequently thawed in 0.4 mL of chilled 0.1 M perchloric acid and sonicated.
Aliquots were taken for protein quantification using a spectrophotometric assay.
Other aliquots were cen-trifuged, and dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured in the supernatants by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemi-cal detection.
Concentrations of dopamine and metabolites were expressed as ng/mg of protein (mean S.E.M.).
MPP+ Levels To determine whether MPTP uptake or metabo-lism was altered, after 1 wk of supplemented or con-trol diets, MPTP 20 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally four times at 2-h intervals and mice were killed 90 min after the last injection.
MPP+ levels were quantified by HPLC with ultraviolet detection at 295 nm.
Samples were sonicated in 0.1 M per-chloric acid and an aliquot of supernatant was injected onto a Brownlee aquapore X03-224 cation exchange column (Rainin, Woburn, MA).
Samples were eluted isocratically with 90% 0.1 M acetic acid and 75 mM triethylamine HCI, pH 2.3, adjusted with formic acid, and 10% acetonitrile (ng/mg protein).
Histological Analysis Three-month-old Swiss Webster mice were fed a standard lab chow diet (control), or diet containing 2% creatine, 0.005% rofecoxib, or a combination of 2% creatine and 0.005% rofecoxib.
After 1 wk, MPTP (20 mg/kg, 5 mL/kg, intraperitoneally) or phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) (5 mL/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered four times at 2-h intervals.
One wk after the last MPTP or PBS treatment, mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and perfused transcardially with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phos-phate buffer, pH 7.4.
Brains were removed, postfixed for 2 h in the same fixative, and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4C.
Serial coronal sec-tions (50 m) were cut through the substantia nigra.
Three sets consisting of eight sections each, 150 m apart were prepared for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), COX-2, or 4-hydroxynonenal immunohistochem-istry using the avidin-biotin peroxidase technique.
Briefly, free-floating sections were pretreated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min.
The sections were incu-bated sequentially in (1) 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min; (2) rabbit anti-TH affinity purified antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 12000), rabbit anti-COX-2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI; 11000), or mouse anti-4-hydrox-ynonenal (11000) diluted in PBS/0.5% BSA) for 18 h; (3) biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labo-ratories, Burlingame, CA; 1200 in PBS/0.5% BSA) for 1 h; and (4) avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex Creatine and COX-2 Inhibitors in MPTP 193 Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 21, 2003 (Vector; 1:200 in PBS) for 1 h. The immunoreaction was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahy-drochloride dihydrate (DAB) with nickel intensifi-cation (Vector) as the chromogen.
All incubations and rinses were performed with agitation using an orbital shaker at room temperature.
The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehy-drated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped.
The numbers of TH-immunoreactive cells in the sub-stantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were counted using the optical fractionator method in the Stereo Investigator (v. 4.35) software program (Micro-brightfield, Burlington, VT).
Results are expressed as the mean S.E.M.
Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests.
Results The effects of administration of MPTP in controls and mice fed with 2% creatine, or 0.005% rofecoxib or their combination are shown in Fig.1.
The dose of MPTP we used (4 20 mg/kg), produced signif-icant dopamine depletion of 69% in mice fed with a regular diet (n = 12/group).
Either 2% creatine or 0.005% rofecoxib significantly attenuated the dopamine depletion (p < 0.01).
In mice fed with cre-atine and rofecoxib combination, there was an additive neuroprotective effect which was signifi-cantly better than either creatine or rofecoxib alone (p < 0.01).
MPTP produced a significant depletion of DOPAC and HVA, which was significantly attenu-ated in mice fed with either creatine or rofecoxib (p < 0.05).
In the combined treatment group the DOPAC levels were significantly greater than those in the groups with the creatine or rofecoxib alone.
A similar additive effect was not seen with HVA, which may be due to experimental variation.
The reduced sensitivity to MPTP was not caused by an alteration in uptake or metabolism of MPTP to MPP+ because striatal MPP+ levels did not significantly differ at 90 min after MPTP administration (MPP+ 30.3 3.5 ng/mg protein in controls, 31.6 3.3 ng/mg protein with creatine, and 38.9 4.2 ng/mg protein with rofecoxib).
The combination of creatine with rofecoxib also had no significant effect on MPP+ levels (34.7 3.6 ng/mg protein).
Histology In mice fed the control diet, MPTP significantly reduced the numbers of TH-immunostained neu-rons in the substantia nigra pars compacta as com-pared with PBS-treated mice by 32% (p < 0.001 vs PBS, Figs.
2 and 3) (n = 10/group).
In MPTP-treated mice, dietary treatment with 2% creatine or 0.005% rofecoxib significantly increased the number of sur-viving TH-immunoreactive cells as compared with mice that received the control diet (p < 0.001 vs con-trol).
The combination of creatine and rofecoxib sig-nificantly attenuated the TH-immunoreactive neuronal loss (p < 0.001 vs control diet/MPTP) although the neuroprotection was not significantly Fig.1.

This was not the result of downregulation of TH expression because adjacent Nissl sections showed identical changes (data not shown).
The pattern of COX-2 immunoreactivity in MPTP-treated mice that received creatine, rofecoxib or its combination was similar to those treated with con-trol diet (data not shown).
4-Hydroxynonenal immunoreactivity increased in the remaining neu-rons in the SNpc of control diet/MPTP-treated mice compared with the control diet/PBS group (Fig.4).
Creatine, rofecoxib, or its combination appeared to reduce the intensity of 4-hydroxynonenal immunore-activity in the substantia nigra (Fig.4).
Discussion There is substantial evidence implicating both mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory mech-anisms in PD pathogenesis.
Evidence for inflam-matory mechanisms comes from a number of studies.
There is an increase in activated microglia in the sub-stantia nigra of idiopathic PD patients as well as patients previously exposed to MPTP(McGeer et al., 1998; Langston et al., 1999).
In PD striatum, mes-senger RNA for the complement components C1Q and C9 is increased (McGeer et al., 2001).
There is an increase in a number of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-as well as IL1-within the sub-stantia nigra of PD patients (Mogi et al., 1994a; Mogi et al., 1994b).
After administration of MPTP to mice, there is evidence for a microglial reaction (Kohut-nicka et al., 1998; Kurkowska-Jastrzebska et al., 1999), which is associated with an increase in proinflam-matory cytokines such as IL-1 (Mogi et al., 1998).
Administration of minocycline has neuroprotective effects in the MPTPmodel, which are associated with a reduction in activated microglia as well as a decrease in mature IL-1 (Du et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2002).
COX-2 is expressed and regulated in glial cells by cytokines including IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (Cao et al., 1994; OBanion et al., 1996).

Creatine and COX-2 Inhibitors in MPTP 195 Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 21, 2003 stantia nigra in rats results in rapid activation of microglia, followed by a delayed and gradual loss of nigral neurons (Gao et al., 2002).
COX-2 is also expressed in neurons after excitotoxic lesions, synap-tic excitation, cerebral ischemia, and in transgenic mouse models of myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Adams et al., 1996; Ho et al., 1998; Planas et al., 1999; Iadecola et al., 2001; Almer et al, 2001).
Arecent study showed that COX-2 immunoreactivity is expressed in dopaminergic neurons following MPTP as well as in the substantia nigra of PD patients (Teismann et al., 2003).
There was no expression in microglia, suggesting that cell autonomous expression of COX-2 may play a role in its toxicity.
The enzyme was active both following MPTP and in PD substantia nigra as evidenced by increased PGE2 levels (Teis-mann et al., 2003).
Several lines of evidence show that COX-2 con-tributes to neuronal cell death both in vitro and in vivo.
Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins, which involves reduction of a hydroperoxide, resulting in the generation of free radicals.
Mice overexpressing COX-2 show increased vulnerability to kainic acid and have elevated lipid peroxidation (Kelley et al., 1999).
Neuronal death mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate is diminished in Fig.3.

Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 21, 2003 a dose-dependent manner by COX-2 inhibitors in primary neuronal cultures (Hewett et al., 2000).
Furthermore, transgenic mice that are deficient in COX-2 show reduced susceptibility to N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity, focal ischemia, and MPTP (Iadecola et al., 2001; Teismann et al., 2003).
We previously showed that mice with a domi-nant-negative inhibition of interleukin converting enzyme, the known activator of IL-1, have a marked attenuation of MPTP induced neurodegeneration (Klivenyi et al., 1999).
IL-1 is known to induce COX-2, a key enzyme involved in the production of both proinflammatory prostanoids as well as reac-tive oxygen species (Smith et al., 2000).
Furthermore, TNF-activates COX-2 via the JNK pathway, which has also been implicated in MPTP neurotoxicity (Saporito et al., 1999; Saporito et al., 2000).
In the present experiments we found that the selec-tive COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib exerted significant neuroprotective effects against the MPTP neurotox-icity.
This is consistent with a recent study, which showed that the COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam showed protection against MPTP induced cell loss, and also showed significant protection against impairment of locomotor activity and depletion of striatal dopamine (Teismann et al., 2001).
Furthermore, another recent study showed that rofecoxib attenu-ated MPTP-induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons as well as fibers in the stria-tum (Teismann et al., 2003).
We also examined whether administration of cre-atine either alone or in combination with rofecoxib could exert significant neuroprotective effects.
Cre-atine administration can buffer into cellular energy stores as well as inhibit opening of the mitochondr-ial permeability transition that is linked to both exci-totoxic and apoptotic cell death (OGorman et al., 1997).
Creatine protects creatine kinase from perox-ynitrite mediated damage (Wendt et al., 2002) and contributes to reuptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles (Xu et al., 1996).
We previously demonstrated that creatine produces dose-dependent neuropro-tective effects, against MPTP induced striatal dopamine depletion as well as loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra (Matthews et al., 1999) and this was confirmed in the present study.
Because the primary neuropro-tective effects of COX2 inhibitors are anti-inflammatory and antioxidative, whereas the primary neuroprotective effects of creatine are to buffer intracellular energy stores, and both mecha-nisms are implicated in MPTP pathogenesis, we examined whether they could exert additive neuro-protective effects.

Creatine, rofecoxib, or their combination reduced perikaryal HNE immunoreactivity.

Creatine and COX-2 Inhibitors in MPTP 197 Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 21, 2003 minocycline exerts additive neuroprotective effects with creatine in a transgenic mouse model of amy-otrophic lateral sclerosis (Zhu et al., 2003).
Further-more, a combination of minocycline, nimodipine, and riluzole exerted additive neuroprotective effects in a transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Kriz et al., 2003).
We previously showed that the combination of coenzyme Q10 with the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist remacemide exerts additive neuroprotective effects in a transgenic mouse model of Huntingtons disease (Ferrante et al., 2002).
There is, therefore, ample precedent that agents targeting different disease mechanisms may exert additive or synergistic neuroprotective effects.
In the present experiments, creatine exerted sig-nificant neuroprotective effects against MPTP, and, when combined with rofecoxib, it produced addi-tive neuroprotective effects.
The effects of rofecoxib were associated with a reduction in oxidative damage as assessed by 4-hydroxynonenal immuno-cytochemistry.
This is consistent with a recent report that administration of rofecoxib significantly reduced MPTP induced increases in 5-cysteinyl-dopamine, a stable adduct produced by COX-related oxidation of dopamine.
Both creatine and potent COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to be safe and well tolerated in man and can, therefore, be readily examined in clinical trials.
It is, therefore, possible that a combination of creatine with a COX-2 inhibitor might prove to be useful as a strategy for neuro-protective treatment of PD.
