npgrj_nbt_1490 1019..1027 Discovery of a hepatitis C target and its pharmacological inhibitors by microfluidic affinity analysis Shirit Einav1,2,5, Doron Gerber3,5, Paul D Bryson2, Ella H Sklan2, Menashe Elazar2, Sebastian J Maerkl3,4, Jeffrey S Glenn2 & Stephen R Quake3 More effective therapies are urgently needed against hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of viral hepatitis.
We used in vitro protein expression and microfluidic affinity analysis to study RNA binding by the HCV transmembrane protein NS4B, which plays an essential role in HCV RNA replication.
We show that HCV NS4B binds RNA and that this binding is specific for the 3 terminus of the negative strand of the viral genome with a dissociation constant (Kd) of B3.4 nM.
A high-throughput microfluidic screen of a compound library identified 18 compounds that substantially inhibited binding of RNA by NS4B.
One of these compounds, clemizole hydrochloride, was found to inhibit HCV RNA replication in cell culture that was mediated by its suppression of NS4Bs RNA binding, with little toxicity for the host cell.
These results yield new insight into the HCV life cycle and provide a candidate compound for pharmaceutical development.
Over 150 million people are infected with HCV worldwide.
Unfortu-nately, many of these individuals are unable to clear their infection with the current standard of care, which consists of a combination of interferon and ribavirin1 (Copegus, Rebetol, Rebetron, Virazole).
Moreover, this treatment is associated with substantial side effects, precluding its use by many individuals.
Thus, current therapies are inadequate for the majority of patients1, and there is a pressing need for new HCV drugs1.
The 9.6-kb, positive, single-stranded RNA HCV genome encodes a 3,000-amino-acid polyprotein that is proteolytically processed into structural proteins, which are components of the mature virus, and nonstructural proteins (NS), which are involved in replicating the viral genome2.
Like other positive-strand RNA viruses3, HCV appears to replicate in association with intracellular membrane structures.
In the case of HCV, the structures are termed the membranous web4 and are believed to be induced by the NS4B protein.
NS4B is also required to assemble the other viral NS proteins within the apparent sites of RNA replication5.
It is not known how viral RNA, especially the negative-strand template required for production of progeny genomes, might be incorporated or maintained at these replication sites.
NS4B and HCV RNA have been shown to colocalize to the membranous web6,7, suggesting that NS4B is in intimate contact with viral RNA in the context of authentic viral RNA replication.
The hepatitis A and polio picornaviruses have proteins termed 2C, which are required for replication, bind RNA8,9 and have an N-terminal amphipathic helix and a nucleotide binding motif 810.
NS4B contains the same structural features, and both of them are required for HCV replication5,11.
We thus hypothesized that NS4B may similarly bind RNA, that this interaction might be critical for the HCV life cycle, and that RNA binding by NS4B could be amenable to pharmacologic disruption.
To test these hypotheses, we established an in vitro RNA binding assay in a format enabling simultaneous analysis of multiple conditions, mutants, replicates, quantitative Kd measurements and high-throughput screening for potential pharmacologic inhibitors.
Like the majority of drug targets12, NS4B is a membrane protein.
Membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to express and character-ize biochemically, especially in the quantities required for pharma-ceutical screening.
Moreover, solubilization by detergents can alter their natural membrane-associated topology.
To ameliorate these problems, we used microfluidic tools to perform binding assays with nanoliter protein consumption.
This enabled use of an in vitro cell lysate expression system, which was supplemented with micro-somal membranes to create more natural folding conditions, under which the best NS4B topology data available to date have been obtained13.
The reduced yield relative to conventional expression methods is offset by low sample consumption.
Previous microfluidic tools to measure drug interactions have been limited to enzymatic targets that can catalyze formation of a fluor-escent substrate14.
In this case we directly measured binding constants by using mechanical trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI), a microfluidic affinity assay that has previously been used to measure interactions between transcription factors and DNA15.
We have extended the previous work by showing that MITOMI can be used to measure both binding constants of membrane protein-RNA inter-actions and inhibition of such interactions by small molecules in a Received 30 May; accepted 29 July; published online 31 August 2008; doi:10.1038/nbt.1490 1Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.

The latter point was particularly surprising in that the elastomer used to fabricate the device is known to have limitations in chemical compatibility16,17; here we show that this does not prevent its use in a drug screen or the discovery of a small molecule with the desired pharmacological properties.
Taken together, the results of this paper reveal a novel HCV target and show that microfluidic technology can be used to discover a new pharmaceutical, thereby validating the use of microfluidic tools in drug discovery18,19.
RESULTS We validated the use of the microfluidic platform for RNA binding by studying two human proteins from the embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (ELAV) family, the RNA binding activity of which is well characterized2022.
We then applied this methodology to study RNA interactions with the transmembrane HCV NS4B protein.
We (i) tested the hypothesis that HCV NS4B binds RNA, (ii) determined the Kd for this interaction, (iii) studied the substrate specificity of this binding, (iv) determined the amino acids within NS4B required for RNA binding and (v) screened a compound library for pharmacologic inhibitors of NS4B RNA binding and HCV replication.
Microfluidic assay validation: HuD binding to RNA HuD is a host cell protein from the ELAV-like family with well-characterized RNA binding activity2022.
It is a cytoplasmic protein that contains three conserved RNA recognition motifs through which it binds AU-rich elements in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of genes such as those encoding cytokines and proto-oncogenes.
Binding was tested against two Cy3-labeled RNA probes: AU3 and a known AU3 mutant to which HuD binding is impaired21,22 (Fig.1).
RNA binding experiments with MITOMI were performed essentially as described15, except that in this case RNA was used instead of DNA (Supplemen-tary Fig.1 online).
Briefly, we spotted a microarray of target RNA sequences labeled with Cy3 onto an epoxy-coated slide.
These arrays were used to program the microfluidic devices by aligning each spot in the array to a unit cell in the device.
After bonding the microfluidic device to a microarray it was subjected to surface patterning that resulted in a circular area coated with biotinylated antihistidine antibodies within each unit cell.
The device was then loaded with an in vitro transcription-translation mixture containing DNA templates coding for HuD fused in-frame with a C-terminal V5-6 histidine tag (HuD-V5-his) or Gus protein fused in-frame with a C-terminal 6 histidine tag (Gus-his).
Bodipy-labeled tRNALys was added for protein labeling.
Each unit cell was then isolated using micromechanical valves followed by an incubation to allow protein synthesis, binding of the synthesized protein to the surface biotiny-lated anti-his antibodies, solvation of target RNA and equilibration of proteins and target RNA.
MITOMI was then performed by actuation of a button membrane to trap surface-bound complexes while expelling any solution-phase molecules.
After a brief wash to remove untrapped, unbound material, the trapped molecules and expressed protein were subsequently detected with an array scanner.
The ratio of bound RNA to expressed protein was calculated for each data point by measuring the median signal of Cy3 to the median signal of bodipy.
The assay detected strong binding of HuD to the AU3 RNA probe; background binding by Gus-his was 7-to 16-fold lower than the HuD signal (Fig.1a).
This background level did not increase with RNA probe concentration and was subtracted from all chambers (Supple-mentary Fig.2 online).
The binding affinity of HuD to the AU3 probe was much greater than that of the AU3 mutant probe: the Kd for AU3 binding was 23 5 nM and that for AU3 mutant binding was 268 95 nM (Fig.1a).
These values agree with previous measurements in a gel shift assay21,22 and validate the MITOMI microfluidic affinity assay for RNA-protein interactions.
RNA binding analysis of another protein from the ELAV-like family, HuR, is shown in Supplementary Fig.3 online.
NS4B binds HCV RNA and Kd is determined by microfluidics We then tested whether HCV NS4B binds RNA.
Because NS4B is important in viral RNA replication, and initiation of positive-strand RNA synthesis is likely to start at the 3 terminus of the negative-strand RNA, we first tested binding of NS4B to this region, using a probe designated 3 negative terminus.

This protein also binds to membranes and can thus anchor the microsomal membranes to the device surface through the inter-action of GFP with anti-GFP (Fig.1c).
The Kd of NS4B binding to the 3 terminus of the HCV negative-strand RNA was measured at 3.4 1.0 nM (Fig.1d).
To the best of our knowledge this is the first report that HCV NS4B binds RNA.
Conventional glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and RNA filter binding assays using recom-binant forms of purified NS4B expressed in Escherichia coli confirmed this finding (Supplementary Fig.4 online), although these were less convenient and amenable to the types of analyses and high-throughput format that we sought.
NS4B specifically binds the 3 terminus of the () viral strand We measured the substrate specificity of the observed NS4B-HCV RNA interaction with three additional HCV probes (Fig.2a).
The probes designated 5 UTR pos and 3 UTR pos correspond to the 5 UTR and 3 UTR sequences of the positive viral strand, respectively, and 5 negative terminus corresponds to the 5 terminus of the negative strand.
The RNA binding experiment was repeated and binding of NS4B to equimolar concentrations (3 nM) of the various probes was compared.
Whereas NS4B binds all four HCV probes, its apparent affinity to the 3 negative terminus probe is 5-to 12-fold greater than to the other three HCV RNA regions tested or to an unrelated delta virus RNA genome sequence23,24 (see Fig.2b).
These findings suggest that it is the RNA sequence, and likely the secondary RNA structure, that determines the specificity of NS4B binding to the 3 terminus of the negative strand.
An ARM in NS4B is essential for RNA binding and HCV replication Various structural motifs responsible for the interaction between proteins and RNA have been reported25.
One of these is the arginine rich motif (ARM).
ARMs were originally defined as short (10 to 20 amino acids) arginine-rich sequences found in viral, bacteriophage and ribosomal proteins (Fig.3a)9,25,26.
There is little identity between ARM sequences, other than the preponderance of arginine residues.
Subsequently, ARM-like motifs, consisting of longer sequences con-taining fewer arginines, were identified9,26.
Inspection of the primary sequence of NS4B reveals the presence of multiple positively charged amino acids (Fig.3b).
The majority of these arginine residues are within the last 71 amino acids, in the C-terminal region of NS4B (Fig.3b,c).
This region is predicted to form a cytoplasmic segment based on empirical topology studies using glycosylation markers13.
Elements of this region conform with previously described ARM-like motifs.

NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 26 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2008 1021 A R T I C L E S 20 08 N at u re P u b lis h in g G ro u p h tt p ://w w w.n at u re.c o m/n at u re b io te ch n o lo g y Using a series of point mutations, we tested if RNA binding by NS4B is mediated by some of its positively charged residues.
A substitution of Arg-Arg in positions 192193 with Ala-Ala was termed RRa mutant and a similar substitution in positions 247248 was designated RRb mutant.
Whereas the RRb mutant decreased binding by NS4B to the 3 negative terminus probe by fivefold, RNA binding activity to the RRa mutant was completely eliminated at the same probe concentration (1.5 nM; Fig.3d).
These results suggest that the tested arginine residues mediate RNA binding by NS4B in vitro.
To test the hypothesis that these positively charged residues are also impor-tant for HCV replication, we introduced these mutations into high-efficiency subgenomic HCV replicons and assayed them in standard replicon colony formation assays (data not shown).
The various mutations substantially impaired HCV RNA replication and the degree of replication inhibition correlated with the degree of NS4B RNA binding impairment (unpublished data).
These results suggest that efficient binding of HCV RNA is required for viral replication in vitro.
Alignment of the sequences of natural HCV isolates currently available in databases reveals that these positively charged residues are highly conserved across all HCV genotypes.
This conservation suggests that there is a requirement for the RNA binding residues for productive viral infection in vivo.
High-throughput screening for inhibitory compounds We screened a compound library for small molecules that could inhibit the RNA-NS4B interaction.
We spotted 1,280 compounds from a small-molecule library on epoxy-coated slides in a microarray format (Fig.4a).
The array was allowed to dry and was then aligned and bonded to a microfluidic device.
The rest of the assay was performed as before, except that the device was loaded with NS4B-GFP followed by Cy5-labeled 3 terminus negative RNA probe.
In the primary screen, the compounds were spotted at a concentration of B1 mM.
The entire library was screened in duplicate using only two microfluidic devices.
Out of 1,280 compounds, 104 were found to have an inhibitory effect (490% inhibition) on RNA binding by NS4B.
In addition, there were 110 compounds for which there was a substantial discrepancy between the two tested replicates or for which one or two of the measurements had been disrupted due to technical errors.
The 214 compounds (104 + 110) identified in the primary screen were subjected to a secondary screen (Fig.4a).
This was done in a similar manner except that a smaller device was used, the spotted compound concentration was tenfold lower than in the primary screen and five replicates were spotted for each compound.
Eighteen compounds were confirmed to substantially inhibit RNA binding by NS4B out of the 214 compounds tested (Fig.4b).
Six of these compounds were tested for specificity; five of them did not inhibit binding of HuR protein to its own 4A target RNA sequence (Supple-mentary Fig.3) nor did they inhibit HuR binding to its previously described HCV RNA target, that is the 3 terminus of the negative viral strand27, suggesting that these hits are specific.
This data and addi-tional data supporting the validity of the screen are presented in Supplementary Data and Supplementary Fig.5 online.
Inhibitors of HCV RNA replication We measured the inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication of the compounds identified in the above screen in cell culture.
After electroporation with a full-length HCV RNA genome harboring a luciferase reporter gene28, Huh7.5 cells were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of these compounds.
Luciferase assays were performed at 72 h. In parallel, the viability of cells in the presence of the compounds was assessed by an Alamar Bluebased assay.
Six of the compounds showed some antiviral effect above that solely attributable to cellular toxicity.
One of these, clemizole hydrochloride (1-p-chlorobenzyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) methylbenzimidazole hydro-chloride), an H1 histamine receptor antagonist, was found to sub-stantially inhibit HCV replication.
A tenfold decrease in viral replication was measured at 20 mM concentration of the drug, with an half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of B8 mM (Fig.4c).
At these concentrations there was no measurable cellular toxicity (Fig.4c).
Similar results were obtained by real-time PCR assays performed in clemizole-treated Huh7.5 cells infected with the infec-tious HCV clone (J6/JFH)29 (Supplementary Fig.6 online).
The in vitro half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of clemizole for RNA binding by NS4B is B24 1 nM (Fig.4d).
Clemizole-resistant mutants The mechanism of action of clemizoles antiviral activity was further substantiated by selecting for clemizole-resistant HCV mutants.

1022 VOLUME 26 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2008 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY A R T I C L E S 20 08 N at u re P u b lis h in g G ro u p h tt p ://w w w.n at u re.c o m/n at u re b io te ch n o lo g y B60 colonies that were able to grow in the presence of the compound.
Eleven individual colonies were successfully expanded, passaged 510 times and the HCV RNA replicating in the cells was subjected to sequence analysis.
In addition, RNA from a pool of clemizole-resistant colonies was isolated and subjected to a similar analysis.
Three colonies were found to harbor replicons with mutations that mapped to the NS4B region, and six colonies were found to harbor replicons with mutations that mapped to the negative strand 3 terminus RNA region.
In addition there was one colony with mutations that mapped to both NS4B and the negative strand 3 terminus, and one where we have yet to find the location of the mutation conferring resistance to clemizole.
No such mutations were identified in ten replicon colonies that were passaged in parallel in the absence of the drug.
Two of the clemizole-resistant NS4B mutants were characterized in detail.
The first, W55R is depicted in Figure 5a.
It involves the substitution of an arginine for the tryptophan at amino acid 55 within a predicted cytoplasmically oriented segment of NS4B.
This mutation is sufficient to confer a clemizole-resistant phenotype in cells: Huh7.5 cells transfected with either whole-cell RNA extracted from the W55R mutant cells (Fig.5b) or with in vitro-transcribed J6/ JFH RNA encoding this point mutation and a linked luciferase reporter gene (Fig.5c) were unaffected by 10 mM clemizole.
The EC50 of clemizole on the W55R mutant J6/JFH RNA was B18 mM (2.25 times the EC50 of the wild-type RNA).
Similar to other HCV mutants resistant to an NS3 protease inhibitor31, the absolute level of replication of the W55R mutant was lower than that of the wild-type genome, suggesting that the drug-resistant mutation comes at the cost of impaired replication fitness.
We also introduced this mutation into the NS4B-GFP vector and tested it for its RNA binding activity using the in vitro micro-fluidic assay.
Although both mutant and wild-type NS4B proteins experienced an approximately twofold reduction of RNA binding in the presence of 10 nM clemizole, because the baseline RNA binding of the mutant is higher, the residual amount of RNA bound by the mutant in the presence of clemizole was comparable to that bound by the wild type in the absence of clemizole (Fig.5d).
Furthermore, this mutant demonstrates greater apparent affinity to the viral RNA with a Kd of 0.75 nM (versus 3.4 nM for wild-type NS4B) (Fig.5e).
The second clemizole-resistant mutation, termed R214Q, was identified in a resistant colony as well as in pooled resistant cells.
It involves the substitution of a glutamine for the arginine at amino acid 214 within the cytoplasmic C-terminal segment of NS4B.
Similar results to the first mutation were obtained in cellular and in vitro analyses done on this mutation, with an EC50 of 40.3 mM (B5 times higher than the EC50 on the wild-type RNA) in the luciferase reporterlinked replication assay and a Kd of 0.6 nM in the in vitro binding assay (data not shown).
Presumably both of these mutations alter the conformation of NS4B so as to increase its affinity for the viral RNA.
Indeed the Kds measured by the in vitro RNA binding assay reflect this.
Taken together, the above data provide genetic and biochemical evidence for clemizoles mechanism of action.
DISCUSSION The above results demonstrate that HCV NS4B binds RNA and that this binding is specific for the 3 terminus of the negative strand of the viral genome.
Because the in vivo specificity of this interaction has not yet been determined quantitatively, one should use the usual caution in extrapolating the numerical value of our in vitro results.
We also showed that an arginine richlike motif in NS4B is essential for RNA binding and for HCV replication.
Clemizole hydrochloride was found to have a substantial inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication mediated by its suppression of NS4Bs RNA binding.
Because NS4B is associated with membranes5 and is known to induce membrane replication sites4, its RNA binding activity offers a mechanism to incorporate the viral genome into the HCV replication compartment.
This may facilitate the initiation of synthesis of the nascent positive strand from the membrane-anchored negative strand.
NS4B may also act by recruiting the polymerase complex to the HCV RNA, through its interaction with the NS5B polymerase or other components of the replication complex32.

NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 26 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2008 1023 A R T I C L E S 20 08 N at u re P u b lis h in g G ro u p h tt p ://w w w.n at u re.c o m/n at u re b io te ch n o lo g y The in vitro IC50 of clemizole for RNA binding by NS4B is B24 1 nM, whereas its EC50 for viral replication is B8 mM.
It is possible that poor cellular permeability accounts for the B400-fold difference between the IC50 measured for in vitro RNA binding by NS4B and the EC50 measured for the antiviral effect in cells.
We hypothesize that improved drug delivery and optimization of the compound after structure-activity relationship analysis will improve its potency as an antiviral agent and that the microfluidic platform can facilitate this process.
This study also demonstrates the utility of a microfluidic approach.
The microfluidic affinity assay has several important advantages over currently used methods, which make it a promising and general tool for drug discovery, especially against membrane-bound targets.
First, protein synthesis by mammalian reticulocyte lysates in the presence of microsomal membranes provides the natural conditions required for protein folding.
Second, the microfluidic assay eliminates the need for a high level of protein expression and purification, a problem common to currently used methods.
Third, this assay is capable of detecting transient and low-affinity interactions15.
Fourth, the microfluidic device is capable of making many parallel measure-ments, and therefore can be used for high-throughput screening.
Finally, we have shown, in spite of known chemical compatibility issues with the elastomer used to fabricate the device, that one can successfully screen and discover small molecules with desired phar-macological properties.
As with HIV and tuberculosis, effective pharmacologic control of HCV will likely best be achieved by a cocktail of several drugs against independent virus-specific targets.
Combination of even a moderate NS4B inhibitor with other emerging anti-HCV agents represents an attractive paradigm for increasing current virologic response rates.
Although we hypothesize that more potent inhibitors than clemizole can be obtained, because clemizole has already been extensively used in humans (albeit for a different indication based on its antipruritic properties) it may find immediate use as a critical component of next generation anti-HCV strategies.
METHODS Plasmids.
Standard recombinant DNA technology was used to construct and purify all plasmids.
All regions that were amplified by PCR were analyzed by automated DNA sequencing.
Plasmid DNAs were prepared from large-scale bacterial cultures and purified by aMaxiprep kit (Marligen Biosciences).
Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs.
The open reading frames (ORF) of HuR and HuD were obtained from the ORFeome library of cDNA clones (Open Biosystems).
These ORFs were inserted into the expression vectorpcDNA-Dest 40 vector (Invitrogen) by the use of gateway technology (Invitrogen) allowing addition of a C-terminal V5-his tag.
The plasmid pcDNA-NS4B-GFP encoding NS4B of genotype 1a fused in frame with a C-terminal GFP was previously described5.
The mutations RRa, RRb and W55R were introduced into this plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene)).
The plasmid NS5A(AH)GFP was constructed as previously reported.
Gus-his vector was obtained from Roche.
The plasmids pcDNA3.1-5 UTR pos, which encodes the 5 UTR of the positive viral strand, was generated by amplification of the 5 UTR positive sequence from the Bart79I plasmid33 with primers containing EcoRV restriction sites, digestion with EcoRV and ligation into the corresponding site in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen).
The plasmid pcDNA3.1-3 negative terminus, which encodes the 3 terminal region of the negative RNA strand, was generated the same way except that the EcoRV-flanked insert was ligated in an inverse orientation.
The plasmids pcDNA3.1 3 UTR pos and 5 negative terminus were similarly generated except that the inserted gene was flanked by HindIII and Xho1 restriction sites.
The vector encoding the delta virus genomic RNA sequence was cloned by inserting NheI-flanked HDV sequence into a pSPT19 vector (Roche Diagnos-tics) cut with XbaI23,24.
The plasmid FL-J6/JFH-5C19Rluc2AUbi that consists of the full-length HCV genome and expresses Renilla luciferase was a gift from Charles M. Rice28.
The W55R mutation was introduced into this plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (using the QuikChange kit).
In vitro RNA transcription and fluorescent and radioactive labeling.
Plasmid DNA of the 5 and 3 terminal regions of the negative and positive viral strands were linearized with XbaI.
The plasmid DNA of the delta genomic sequence was linearized with XbaI.
Linearized plasmids were then treated with proteinase K, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol.
The DNA was resuspended in RNase-free water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.
We used 4 mg of DNA as a template for transcription with the T7 MEGAscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturers protocol.
The template DNA was digested by the addition of 5 U of RQ1 DNase (Ambion) and a 15-min incubation at 37 1C.
The unincorporated ribonucleotides were removed by size exclusion with a Micro Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad), and the transcribed RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, followed by precipita-tion in ethanol.
The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in H2O.
Determination of the RNA concentration was performed by measure-ment of the optical density at 260 nm.
The integrity of the RNA and its concentration were confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
The RNA sequences were labeled with Cy5 by using Label IT kit (Mirus) according to the manufacturers protocol followed by purification on a microspin column (Mirus) and ethanol precipitation.
The number of fluor-escent labels per RNA molecule was determined by measuring the spectro-photometric absorbance of the nucleic-dye conjugate at 260 nm and the lMAX for Cy5 (650 nm).
This was proportional to the probes length and was used to adjust our binding experiments results.
Cy3-labeled RNA probes used to study RNA binding by HuR and HuD were purchased from IDT.
Radioactive labeling of RNA probes with 32P was done as previously described34.
Device design.
Device fabrication and design was done essentially as described15.
In brief, a control layer, which harbors all channels required to actuate the valves, is situated on top of a flow layer, which contains the network of channels being controlled.
All biological assays and fluid manipula-tions are performed on the flow layer.
A valve is created where a control channel crosses a flow channel.
The resulting thin membrane in the junction between the two channels can be deflected by hydraulic actuation.
Using multiplexed valve systems allows a large number of elastomeric microvalves to perform complex fluidic manipulations within these devices.
Introduction of fluid into these devices is accomplished through stainless steel pins inserted into holes punched through the silicone.
Computer-controlled external solenoid valves allow actuation of multiplexors, which in turn allow complex addressing of a large number of microvalves.
Each unit cell is controlled by three micro-mechanical valves as well as a button membrane (Supplementary Fig.1).
The button membrane of each unit cell masks a circular area within the flow channel between two sandwich valves.
Aligning and bonding a microarray to the device allows positioning of the spotted material (RNA probes or inhibitory compounds) within the RNA chamber of each unit cell.
This chamber can then be opened to the flow channel by the control of a neck valve.
Devices had either 640 or 2,400 unit cells.
RNA binding assay.
The approach used was a modification of the previously described method for protein-DNA interactions15 (Supplementary Fig.1).
For soluble proteins: RNA arraying and device alignment.
A dilution series of Cy3-labeled target RNA sequences were spotted as a microarray onto epoxy-coated glass substrates slide (CEL Associates) by OmniGrid Micro (GeneMa-chines) microarrayer using a CMP3B pin (TeleChem International) with column and row pitches of 680 mm and 320 mm, respectively.
Each sample solution contained 1% BSA in dH2O to prevent covalent linkage of the target RNA to the epoxy functional groups as well as for visualization during 1024 VOLUME 26 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2008 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY A R T I C L E S 20 08 N at u re P u b lis h in g G ro u p h tt p ://w w w.n at u re.c o m/n at u re b io te ch n o lo g y alignment.
After spotting the arrays were quality controlled on a GenePix4000b (Molecular Devices).
The arrays were then aligned to a microfluidic device by hand on a SMZ1500 (Nikon) stereoscope and bonded overnight in the dark on a heated plate at 40 1C.
Surface chemistry (Supplementary Fig.1c online).
All devices were driven between 10 and 15 p.s.i.
in the control line and between 4 and 6 p.s.i.
for the flow line.
For the initial surface-derivatization steps the chamber valves remained closed to prevent liquid from entering the chambers containing the spotted RNA targets.
First, all accessible surface area was derivatized by flowing a solution of biotinylated BSA (Pierce) resuspended to 2 mg/ml in dH2O for 30 min through all channels, followed by a 10 min PBS wash. Next a 500 mg/ml neutravidin (Pierce) solution in PBS was flowed for 20 min, followed by a 10 min PBS wash. Next, the button membrane was closed and the PBS wash continued for an additional 5 min.
Then all remaining accessible surface area except for the circular area of 60 mm masked by the button was passivated with the same biotinylated solution as above for 30 min, followed by a 10 min PBS wash.
Finally a 1:1 solution ofbiotinylated-5-histidine antibody (Qiagen) in 2% BSA in PBS was loaded for 25 min, after which the button membrane was opened and flow continued for 20 min allowing specific functionalization of the previously masked circular area.
This was again followed by a 10 min PBS wash completing the surface derivatization procedure.
Protein synthesis and MITOMI.
Next a standard 25 ml TNT T7coupled wheat germ extract mixture (Promega) was prepared and spiked with 1 ml tRNALys-bodipy-fl (Promega) and 2 ml of plasmid DNA template coding for the appropriate protein (HuR, HuD or Gus).
The mixture was immediately loaded into the device and flushed for 5 min, after which the chamber valves were opened allowing for dead-end filling of the chambers with wheat germ extract.
The chamber valves were again closed and flushing continued for an additional 5 min.
Next the segregation valves separating each unit cell were closed followed by opening of the chamber valves allowing for equilibration of the unit cell by diffusion.
The entire device was heated to 30 1C on a temperature-controlled microscope stage and incubated for up to 90 min to complete protein synthesis, binding of protein to the surface-bound biotiny-lated-5-histidine antibody, solvation of target RNA, and equilibration of proteins and target RNA.
MITOMI was then performed by closing the button membrane as well as the chamber valves allowing trapping surface-bound complexes while expelling any solution phase molecules.
Radial closure pre-vents solvent pockets from forming between the two interfaces and effectively creates zero dead volume while preserving the equilibrium concentrations of the molecular interactions.
This was followed by a 5 min PBS wash to remove untrapped unbound material.
The device was then imaged on a modified arrayWoRxe (AppliedPrecision) microarray scanner to detect protein synthesis and the trapped molecules.
Image and data analysis.
All images were analyzed with GenePix3.0 (Molecular Devices).
For each experiment an image was taken after MITOMI and the final PBS wash.
This was used to determine the concentration of surface-bound protein (FITC channel) as well as surface-bound target RNA (Cy3 channel).
Each unit cell generated a single data point that consisted of the ratio of median signal of Cy3 to median signal of bodipy; thus, representing the ratio of surface-bound RNA to surface-bound expressed protein.
Data from multiple data points were averaged and their s.d.
calculated.
Results were then normalized to 1.
Between 10 and 20 replicates were included for each probe tested.
A control protein, Gus-his (Roche) was included in each experiment and subjected to the same analysis.
When present, detected signal with Gus-his was used for background subtraction.
For membrane-associated proteins.
Detection of RNA binding by NS4B was done as described except for the following modifications.
NS4B was expressed off the microfluidic device by using a coupled transcription/ translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega).
We added 2 ml canine microsomal membranes (Promega) to the reaction mixture to allow appro-priate protein folding.
An NS4B-GFP construct was used thus eliminating the need for tRNALysbodipyfl in the reaction mixture.
A biotinylated anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) was used to specifically functionalize the protected circular area defined by the button.
The protein was anchored to the chip via its interaction with the surface-bound anti-GFP antibodies.
The surface-bound protein and the Cy5-labeled HCV RNA probes were loaded into the chip and allowed to incubate for 520 min in a 50-mM HEPES KOH (pH 6.8) buffer.
Next, MITOMI was performed followed by a brief wash in HEPES KOH (pH 6.8) buffer.
The device was then scanned and results quantified as described above.
NS4B-GFP mutants and NS5A(AH)-GFP were assayed the same way.
Signal detected with NS5A(AH)-GFP was used for background subtraction.
Screening of inhibitory compound library.
The 1,280 compounds of the Lopac library (Sigma) solubilized in DMSO were spotted onto epoxy-coated glass substrates slide by OmniGrid Micro microarrayer using a CMP3B pin as a microarray.
For the primary screen compounds were spotted at a high concentration (B1 mM) in duplicates.
The array was allowed to dry and was then aligned and bonded to a microfluidic device.
Two large devices (2,400 unit cells per device) were used for the primary screen.
The rest of the procedure was done similarly to the described above (RNA binding assay).
In brief, the device was subjected to surface patterning that resulted in a circular area coated with biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies within each unit cell.
Next, NS4B-GFP expressed off chip using coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte system in the presence of microsomal membranes was loaded into the chip and bound to the surface biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies.
Cy5-labeled 3 neg terminus RNA probe was then loaded at a concentration of 1.5 nM.
Each unit cell was then isolated followed by a 30 min incubation to allow binding of the protein to surface-biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies, solvation of library compounds, and equilibration of proteins and target RNA.
Next, MITOMI was performed trapping surface-bound complexes while expelling any solution phase molecules.
After a brief wash to remove untrapped unbound material the device was scanned and results analyzed.
The ratio of bound RNA to expressed protein was calculated for each data point by measuring the median signal of Cy3 to median signal of bodipy.
Results were normalized to signal measured in unit cells containing no inhibitory com-pound.
Greater than 90% inhibition was defined as the cutoff for inhibition in the primary screen; 104 compounds which were above this cutoff and an additional 110 yielding ambiguous results were subjected to a secondary screen.
This was performed similarly, except that two smaller devices (640 unit cells per each) were used; the spotted compound concentration was 10-fold lower than in the primary screen, and five replicates were spotted for each compound.
Inhibition 42.5 fold was considered significant.
18 compounds identified in this screen were further analyzed for their inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication.
Determination of IC50 for in vitro RNA binding.
For an accurate measure-ment of IC50s, serial dilutions of the inhibitory compound were loaded onto the microfluidic device by continuous flow while maintaining a steady con-centration of the compound in the flow channel.
This helped to avoid losses of the spotted compounds from incomplete solubilization and/or binding of the compound to PDMS.
The experiment was performed essentially as described in the RNA binding assay for transmembrane proteins except that the expressed protein and the Cy5-labeled HCV RNA probes were incubated in the device in the presence of the inhibitory compounds or their absence.
IC50s were measured as described in the statistical analysis section below.
Expression and purification of recombinant NS4B.
GST-NS4B and GST were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified as described elsewhere11.
NS4B was fused in frame with an N-terminal 6his-MISTIC protein (membrane-integrating sequence for translation of IM protein constructs)35.
Overnight cultures of E. coli transformed with mistic-NS4B plasmid were diluted 1:100 in 400 ml of fresh medium and grown at 37 1C to an OD of 0.8.
IPTG (Invitrogen) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM.
After 3 h growth at 37 1C cells were pelleted and resuspended in 30cml lysis buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCL (pH8), 100 mM imidazole, 10 mM decylmaltoside, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)).
Cells were lysed by one cycle in a French Press at a pressure of 10,000 p.s.i.
for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min at 4 1C.
The supernatant was loaded on a nickel column (Amersham).
After washes, protein was eluted in a buffer containing 400 mM imidazole.
Glycerol was added at a final concentration of 20% and samples were stored at 20 1C.
Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE.
Total protein concentration was measured using the RC-DC assay (Bio-Rad).
NS4B-mistic was identified by western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 26 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2008 1025 A R T I C L E S 20 08 N at u re P u b lis h in g G ro u p h tt p ://w w w.n at u re.c o m/n at u re b io te ch n o lo g y 6-his (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NS4B (Virostat).
6his-mistic was expressed and purified in a similar manner.
GST pull-down assay.
Similar to a previously described strategy36, 1 mg of purified GST-NS4B or GST was incubated for 1 h at 37 1C in a 50 ml reaction mixture containing 32P-labeled in vitrotranscribed HCV RNA (corresponding to the 3 terminus of the negative viral strand) and binding buffer (10 mM DTT, 10 mM Na HEPES (pH 7.4), 33 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2).
We then added 50 ml oftRNA precoated glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), followed by 1 h incubation at 4 1C to allow binding of GST to the beads.
The beads were then washed three times in binding buffer and bound RNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting of sample aliquots.
Control incubations with an RNA probe prepared in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase were used for background subtraction.
RNA filter binding assay.
Assays were performed essentially as described34.
Briefly, various concentrations of mistic-NS4B protein or mistic control were incubated for 1 h at 30 1C with 3.3 nM 32P-labeled in vitrotranscribed HCV RNA probe in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 ng/ml tRNA and 0.2 mM decylmaltoside) in a final volume of 40 ml.
Membranes were presoaked in the binding buffer and assembled in a dot-blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schull) from top to bottom as follows: nitrocellulose (Biorad), Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences), Whatman 3-mm filter paper.
The binding reactions were loaded onto the dot-blot apparatus and filtered through the membranes.
After washing, the membranes were air-dried and visualized by phospho-imaging.
Results represent percentage of bound RNA calculated by dividing the signal detected in the nitrocellulose membrane by the sum of the signals detected in the nitrocellulose and the Hybond membranes.
Cell culture and electroporation.
Huh7.5 cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine (Gibco), 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin (Gibco), 1 nonessential amino acids (Gibco) and 10% FBS (Omega Scientific).
Cell lines were passaged twice weekly after treatment with 0.05% trypsin0.02% EDTA and seeding at a dilution of 1:5.
Subconfluent Huh7.5 cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 700g for 5 min.
The cells were then washed three times in ice-cold RNase-free PBS (BioWhit-taker) and resuspended at 1.5 107 cells/ml in PBS.
Wild-type or mutant FL-J6/JFH-5C19Rluc2AUbi RNA for electroporation was generated by in vitro transcription of XbaI-linearized DNA templates using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion), followed by purification, essentially as described above (in vitro RNA transcription and fluorescent labeling).
We mixed 5 mg of RNA with 400 ml of washed Huh7.5 cells in a 2-mm-gap cuvette (BTX) and immediately pulsed (0.82 kV, five 99 ms pulses) with a BTX-830 electroporator.
After a 10 min recovery at 25 1C, pulsed cells were diluted into 10 ml of prewarmed growth medium.
Cells from several electroporations were pooled to a common stock and seeded in 6-well plates (5 105 cells per well).
After 24 h, medium was replaced and cells were grown in the presence of serial dilutions of the various inhibitory compounds (Sigma) identified in the screen.
Seventeen commercially available compounds, out of the 18 identified, were analyzed.
Untreated cells were used as a negative control for water-soluble compounds.
For compounds solubilized in DMSO, untreated cells were grown in the presence of corresponding concentrations of the solvent as a negative control.
Medium was changed daily.
After 72 h of treatment cells were subjected to an Alamar Bluebased viability assay and luciferase assay.
Viability assay.
After 72 h of treatment cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 1C in the presence of 10% Alamar Blue reagent (TREK Diagnostic Systems).
Plates were then scanned and fluorescence was detected by using FLEXstation II 384 (Molecular Devices).
Depending on the inhibitory compounds solvent, water or DMSO, signal was normalized relatively to untreated samples or samples grown in the presence of DMSO, respectively.
Luciferase assay.
Viral RNA replication was determined using Renilla luciferase assay (Promega).
The same samples subjected to the viability assay described above were analyzed in this assay.
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plate into 250 ml of ice-cold Renilla lysis buffer according to the manufacturers protocol.
We then loaded 20 ml of the cell lysates onto 96-well plates.
We injected 100 ml of the Renilla luciferase assay buffer containing the assay substrate and measured luciferase activity using a Berthold LB 96 V luminometer.
As above, signal was normalized relative to untreated samples or samples grown in the presence of the corresponding concentration of DMSO.
Luciferase activity detected in samples treated with 100 u/ml interferon a B2 (PBL Biomedical Labs) was used as a positive control, demonstrating three log reduction at 72 h treatment.
The experiment was repeated four times, each time with triplicates.
IC50s were measured by fitting data to a three-parameter logistic curve using the formula Y a+(b a)/(1 + 10^(X c)) (BioDataFit, Chang Bioscience).
Real-time PCR.
5 104 Huh7.5 ells were infected with cell culture-grown HCV titered at 1.4 104 TCID50/ml, as described29.
Two hours after infection, cells were washed three times in culture medium.
Cells were then treated daily with various concentrations of clemizole.
After 72 h samples were subjected to the viability assay described above, following which TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) was added and total cell RNA was extracted in triplicates according to the manufacturers instructions.
Reverse transcription was then performed using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
Real-time PCR was performed on the resulting cDNA to quantify the amounts of HCV and actin RNA (in separate reactions) in each sample.
Standards were made using an in vitro-transcribed HCV RNA and human actin standard (Applied Biosystems).
HCV was quantified using primers AGAGCCATAG TGGTCT and CCAAATCTCCAGGCATTGAGC and probe 6-carboxyfluores-cein-CACCGGAATTGCCAGGACGACCGG-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine.
Actin was quantified using beta-actin control reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers instructions.
HCV RNA level was adjusted to actin level and normalized relative to untreated samples.
Selection of resistant mutants.
Established HCV replicon-harboring cells and Huh7 cells electroporated de novo with a genotype 1b subgenomic HCV replicon (Bart 79I)30 were passaged in the presence of neomycin and increasing concentration of clemizole (1-16 mM).
Colonies that were able to grow in the presence of the compound were isolated and propagated for 510 passages.
Eleven colonies (out of B60) survived the passages and were subjected to sequence analysis, as previously described11.
Whole-cell RNA electroporation.
Whole-cell RNA was extracted from clem-izole-resistant replicon clones and from untreated replicon cells using TRIzol reagent.
Equal amounts of whole cell RNA (50 mg) were electroporated into Huh7.5 cells, as described above.
Cells were grown under G418 selection in the presence or absence of clemizole for 3 weeks.
The number of colonies was determined using Image J (National Institutes of Health) following fixation and staining with crystal violet.
Statistical analysis.
Dissociation equilibrium constants were determined by fitting data to the equation describing equilibrium binding; Y a X/(b + X) (a and b represent maximum binding and Kd, respectively) by nonlinear least-squares regression fitting (BioDataFit, Chang Bioscience).
IC50s were measured by fitting data to a three-parameter logistic curve using the formula Y a + (b a)/(1 + 10^(X c)) (a, b and c represent minimum binding, maximum binding and logEC50, respectively)(BioDataFit, Chang Bioscience).
