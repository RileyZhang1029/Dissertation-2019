Although these approaches have had some success, gen- etic variants are often only present in a small subset of the population, and screens are noisy with low overlap between experiments in dif- ferent labs.
Neither provides a mechanistic model explaining how identified genes impact the disease of interest or the dynamics of the pathways those genes regulate.
Such mechanistic models could be used to accurately predict downstream effects of knocking down pathway members and allow comprehensive exploration of the effects of targeting pairs or higher-order combinations of genes.
Results: We developed methods to model the activation of signaling and dynamic regulatory networks involved in disease progression.
Our model, SDREM, integrates static and time series data to link proteins and the pathways they regulate in these networks.
SDREM uses prior information about proteins likelihood of involvement in a disease (e.g. from screens) to improve the quality of the predicted signaling pathways.
We used our algorithms to study the human immune re- sponse to H1N1 influenza infection.
The resulting networks correctly identified many of the known pathways and transcriptional regulators of this disease.
Furthermore, they accurately predict RNA interference effects and can be used to infer genetic interactions, greatly improving over other methods suggested for this task.
Applying our method to the more pathogenic H5N1 influenza allowed us to identify several strain-specific targets of this infection.

1 INTRODUCTION A wide variety of experimental and computational approaches have been used over the past few years to screen for genes that play important roles in human disease.
These include RNA inter- ference (RNAi) screens (Mohr et al., 2010), which knock down human genes to quantify the phenotypic effects in diseases such as HIV (Brass et al., 2008) and influenza (Brass et al., 2009 Karlas et al., 2010 Ko nig et al., 2010) infection, and genome- wide association studies (GWAS), a powerful approach for un- covering strong connections between genetic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease traits (Altshuler et al., 2008). Although these and similar sequencing-based methods have been widely applied and were able to identify many relevant genes, they also suffer from important drawbacks that limit *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

RNAi screen hits are often not reproducible among different labs and experimental settings.
For example, the overlap among hits in HIV screens is low.
Three genome-wide screens identified 842 genes that impact HIV replication, but only three genes were common to all screens (Bushman et al., 2009). Similar low overlap is observed for other diseases as well (Stertz and Shaw, 2011). Interpretability of screen hits remains a challenge, as the screens cannot explain why a gene impacts a disease.
Similarly, interpretation of GWAS hits is not straight- forward as they oftentimes lie outside of coding regions of the genome (Schaub et al., 2012). Even those variants lying within a coding region only explain a small fraction of affected individ- uals for several diseases and conditions (Maher, 2008). These observations motivated methods that integrate GWAS or perturbation information with functional annotations and other types of genomic data (most notably gene expression and protein interaction data). For example, pathway-based GWAS (Wang et al., 2010) maps SNP P-values to proximal genes and links pathways to diseases by testing whether any predefined pathways are enriched for genes that flank significant SNPs. However, this and similar strategies are dependent on the quality of the annotated pathways preventing their use for important diseases that are poorly represented in public pathway databases (Wang et al., 2010). A variety of gene prioritization algorithms, which have been extensively reviewed (Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012 Piro and Di Cunto, 2012) and benchmarked (Bo rnigen et al., 2012), use known disease genes from literature curation, GWAS or other sources as seeds to search for similar genes that are likely to be related to the same disease.
The evidence used to define gene similarity includes text mining, pathway membership, functional annotations, protein properties, sequence, co-expression and proximity in protein protein interaction (PPI) networks.
However, these methods do not attempt to mechanistically model the pathways that are activated during disease progression and response and thus do not provide a model to explain the various observations.
Instead, they use a black box approach they take seed genes as input and produce a ranked list of can- didate genes without explaining the predicted relationship to the disease, which may impair further analysis (Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012). Other algorithms use perturbation and genetic data to link proteins to diseases, while at the same time using other genomic datasets and interaction networks to suggest how these proteins may be involved in disease response (Huang and Fraenkel, 2009 Kim et al., 2011 Ourfali et al., 2007 Tuncbag et al., 2013 Yeang et al., 2004 Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009) However, these methods have only used static models so far.
In such models, the pheno- typic outcomes of the network perturbations (or genetic variants) are typically differentially expressed genes.

Static models ignore the dynamic nature of responses and the temporal changes in active genes and pathways.
Indeed, many transcriptional studies of disease highlight the importance of the temporal aspects, for example, the rapid immune response follow- ing infection (Li et al., 2011 Shapira et al., 2009) and longitudinal clinical studies (Desai et al., 2011). Static modeling of dynamic interactions aggregates several different pathways at once, which leads to missing key factors that are only active at specific times during response (Ernst et al., 2007). In addition, many static al- gorithms do not attempt to infer the directionality of the edges on the pathways despite the importance of edge orientation in cor- rectly representing signaling paths (Gitter et al., 2011). To address these issues, we developed the Signaling and Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (SDREM) (Gitter et al., 2013). SDREM combines an input output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) (Bengio and Frasconi, 1995) with a combina- torial optimization algorithm to reconstruct dynamic models of the signaling and regulatory networks using high-throughput data including PPI, transcription factor (TF) binding and time series gene expression data.
The signaling pathways inferred by SDREM are directed cascades that connect sources and target TFs. These TFs are in turn used as part of the reconstructed dynamic regulatory network to explain the temporal gene expres- sion. SDREM was developed and tested on yeast and was shown to accurately reconstruct yeast stress response networks leading to new insights into the specific pathways controlling such re- sponses (Gitter et al., 2013). Although SDREM was successfully applied to model organ- isms, the application to human disease remained a challenge.
The larger scale of the human interaction network makes search and inference much more complicated.
In addition, several data sources available for studying diseases (including RNAi screens and GWAS data) were not used by the original SDREM algo- rithm. Finally, human networks are more complex and involve extensive redundant parallel pathways (Logue and Morrison, 2012), which means that new methods are required to assess the ability of proteins and combinations of proteins to affect disease progression.
Here we present new computational methods that extend SDREM by designing a new target function that uses prior node (protein) information, developing new optimization meth- ods for searching large networks and creating new gene ranking metrics based on target connectivity as a post-processing step.
Combined, these extensions allowed us to apply SDREM to study human response to influenza A viral infection.
The result- ing networks identified several key proteins and pathways known to be involved in H1N1 influenza response and predicted novel targets as well.
To comprehensively test our method s ability to identify potential drug targets, we used the reconstructed net- works to predict the results of RNAi screens demonstrating that SDREM can make accurate predictions regarding such po- tential targets.
SDREM correctly predicts more RNAi screen hits than top genome-wide gene prioritization algorithms, and its predictions are better suited for experimental validation i228 because they are placed in the context of influenza-specific path- ways.
We also used SDREM to predict genetic interactions that can lead to reduced viral load.
Finally, we used SDREM to study the more lethal H5N1 influenza.
Comparing the networks con- structed for H1N1 and H5N1 allowed us to predict genes that are uniquely involved in H5N1 response, shedding light on the specific characteristics of this infection.
2 METHODS 2.1 SDREM: Signaling and Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner SDREM (Gitter et al., 2013) links the two core components of the cellular response to an external infection or treatment: signaling cascades and transcriptional regulation.
To reconstruct such models, SDREM starts with the upstream proteins that detect the invading pathogen and deter- mines signaling pathways that allow such proteins to communicate with downstream TFs. The activated TFs coordinate changes in the expression of their bound genes, which allows the cell to adapt to the new condition.
SDREM integrates general TF binding data and PPI network informa- tion with condition-specific time series gene expression data to build such models.
To find TFs that are end points of the signaling pathways initiated by the upstream proteins and responsible for the observed temporal tran- scriptional changes SDREM iteratively combines two computational modules.
For the regulatory part of the model, SDREM uses an IOHMM to analyze time series expression profiles and identify split events places in the time series where a group of co-expressed genes starts to diverge (Ernst et al., 2007). These split events are annotated with TFs that are predicted to control them allowing the method to assign temporal information to the (static) TF gene interaction data.
Using the putative active TFs predicted for various splits, SDREM assesses the likelihood that each of these TFs is indeed responding to the infection or treatment.
A TF that is not well-connected to the upstream source proteins in the signaling network is unlikely to be a major driver of the transcriptional response.
To search for such connections, SDREM enumerates all possible depth-bounded paths from the sources to the TFs in the undirected PPI network.
Next, SDREM orients the PPI network forcing information to flow along each edge in a single direction (Gitter et al., 2011). To find the optimal orientation SDREM maximizes the following combinatorial function:X where P is the set of all unique depth-bounded paths between sources and TFs, IsÃ°pÃž is an indicator function that has the value 1 if path p is satisfied and w(p) is the path weight.
A satisfied path is a path in which all of the edges have been oriented such that the TF is reachable from the source.
Our initial edge orientation analysis (Gitter et al., 2011) used only edge confidence to weight paths, which in practice reduced wÃ°p) to Y IsÃ°pÃžwÃ°pÃž p2P wÃ°pÃž Â¼ wÃ°eÃž e2p Ã°1Ãž Ã°2Ãž where p is a source target path and e is an edge on the path.
Edge weights w(e) depend on our confidence that a specific interaction exists (Supplementary Table S1) so that more confident pathways have higher weights (Gitter et al., 2011). SDREM uses the source-TF pathways in the oriented network to quantify how well the putative active TFs are connected to the sources.
This information is fed back into the temporal gene expression analysis and SDREM s two stages (IOHMM and network orientation) iterate for a fixed number of rounds.
In all rounds (except for the first when path- ways have not yet been learned), the IOHMM incorporates a prior that represents the likelihood each TF is activated by the signaling pathways  predicted in the previous round.
In addition, the pathways can be used to identify other proteins (not TFs) that are involved in many high-weight satisfied paths and therefore important to the response.
As mentioned above, we previously used SDREM to study yeast stress response.
Conceptually, SDREM is a general algorithm and can be read- ily applied to other organisms as well.
However, when attempting to use it to model human disease response we faced several new computational challenges.
First, the complexity of the human interaction networks means that SDREM s search algorithm would be too time-consuming and thus required specialized approaches to improve the runtime and accuracy.
Second, while in yeast we relied only on edge and target con- fidence to identify high-scoring pathways, human data provides informa- tion about the nodes (proteins) as well leading to a new objective function for finding well-connected TFs. Finally, identifying key signaling proteins by determining their involvement in high-scoring pathways, as was done for yeast, may be less important for the human network.
Instead, to identify potential drug targets, we would like to develop methods that can automatically determine the effects of single or double knockdowns on the ability of human cells to respond to infection or treatment.
Below we discuss the new computational methods we developed to address these issues.
2.2 Algorithm parallelization and source target pathway approximations We explored several avenues for speeding up the computation required to reconstruct the human signaling networks.
Although it is challenging to parallelize the orientation step (because local changes in edge direction may affect other edges in different parts of the network) other aspects of the algorithm could be parallelized including the randomization tests to assess TF connectivity scores and the initial depth-first search.
However, these and other precomputing steps (Supplementary Information) do not reduce the time it takes to orient the network.
The Maximum Edge Orientation problem is NP-hard (Gitter et al., 2011) and we already solve it using a heuristic approach, suggesting that a further approximation may not negatively impact our results.
We thus modified the parallel path enumeration algorithm to only store the top m paths from any source to any TF in our dataset, ranking the paths by path weight.
Considering only the top m paths also enables us to include early termination in the depth-first search s branch traversal, further reducing runtime. Evaluating the objective function requires summing the weights of all satisfied paths, and for every potential edge flip that is considered during greedy local search we must determine which paths are still satis- fied. We now approximate the calculation of the orientation objective function by only examining these top m undirected paths.
In test cases with millions of potential paths, the correlation between the node scores obtained using the exact objective and those obtained with the approximated objective when only using m Â¼ 100 000 was 40.999 (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Therefore, we set m Â¼ 100 000 for our H1N1 and H5N1 analysis.
Incorporating RNAi screens 2.3 When modeling human response, we can sometimes use additional sources of information regarding the involvement of a specific protein.
Although in the original SDREM formulation (Gitter et al., 2013) all proteins were assumed to have the same likelihood of participating in the response pathways, information such as knockdown phenotypic effects or GWAS data can increase our prior belief that a protein participates in one of the response pathways.
To capture such information, we can modify the target function discussed above (Equation 2) to incorporate node priors as follows: Y Y wÃ°pÃž Â¼ wÃ°tÃž wÃ°vÃž e2p v2p wÃ°eÃž Ã°3Ãž SDREM where p is a source target path, t is the target on that path, v is a vertex on the path, e is an edge on the path and the function wÃ° Ãž is the edge confidence or node prior.
Equation 3 attempts to find paths that contain proteins that are likely involved in the response based on the screen data as well as highly reliable protein interactions.
Because the optimization function in Equation 2 is NP-hard (Gitter et al., 2011), the target function in Equation 3 is also NP-hard and the heuristic we used to solve the original (edge only) function can be applied to this formulation as well.
Using prior information regarding protein involvement also helps us better resolve edge orientation in the signaling networks.
Owing to the larger PPI and regulatory networks for human data, there are many more possible connections from sources to targets and disagreements about the orientation of individual PPI in human models.
A gene that is associated with a phenotypic change in an RNAi screen leads to higher weights for the (directed) pathways in which it is contained thus, these are preferred during the network orientation.
Due to pathway redundancy, the con- verse is not necessarily true.
Genes that are negative screen hits may still be highly relevant to signaling pathways.
Although related approaches use the screen hits directly as sources in the network (Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009), we place less trust in the RNAi data.
Independent RNAi screens can exhibit low overlap (Bushman et al., 2009 Stertz and Shaw, 2011) in part owing to the impact of differences in methodology or cell population context (Snijder et al., 2012). Supplemen- tary Table S2 demonstrates this disagreement for RNAi screens for H1N1 influenza infection.
No genes are hits in all five screens, and only a single gene is detected in four of the five screens [note that two of the screens (Bortz et al., 2011 Shapira et al., 2009) are targeted, not genome-wide]. Thus, to derive a prior based on screen results, we convert the RNAi data into vertex weights as follows: ( wÃ°vÃž Â¼ 1  Ã°1  cÃžn, 0:5, if n40 otherwise Ã°4Ãž where w(v) is the weight assigned to a vertex (gene), c is the confidence in the screen in the range Â½0, 1 and n is the number of screens that report v as a hit.
We set c Â¼ 0:75 in all analyses here but could incorporate bio- logical knowledge to set different confidence levels for different screens.
These node priors are used directly in the formula for path weights [w(v) in Equation 3] so that paths containing many screen hits have higher weights.
2.4 Predicting RNAi effects To predict RNAi screen hits for new conditions, we developed methods to estimate the in silico effects of removing a protein from the signaling network component of an SDREM model.
Instead of directly linking the sources and differentially expressed genes, we compute how the connect- ivity to the TFs is affected when a node is removed.
This allows us to leverage the fact that each key TF affects many genes (often hundreds) so blocking access to such TFs significantly impacts the cell s ability to mount an effective response.
We devised several scoring metrics to quantify the effect of node deletion on the targets.
These metrics vary along three lines: (i) All versus Top denotes whether all satisfied paths or only the top-ranked paths are used to calculate change in connectivity.
(ii) Source target Pairs versus Targets determines whether a target s connectivity is evaluated separately for every source (i.e. each source ac- tivates a target differently) or if a target is considered to be disconnected only when it is no longer reachable from any source (i.e. any source can activate the target). (iii) Weighted versus Unweighted specifies if connectivity is treated in a binary (connected or disconnected) or con- tinuous (fraction of connectivity remaining) fashion.
The score for the i229  A.Gitter and Z.Bar-Joseph weighted variant is scorewÃ°AÃž Â¼ P p2PÃ°tÃž X t2T P wÃ°pÃžIÃ°A=2NÃ°pÃžÃž wÃ°pÃž p2PÃ°tÃž Tj j Ã°5Ãž where A is the deleted node, T is the set of all targets, P(t) is the set of paths to the target t to be considered (depending on the choice of All versus Top and Pairs versus Targets), w(p) is the path weight, IÃ° Ãž is an indicator function and N(p) is the set of nodes on the path.
The Pairs option replaces the summation over targets by a double summation over sources and targets and updates the denominator accordingly.
Intuitively, this score is the fraction of path weight that exists along paths that can still activate t after A is deleted averaged across all targets.
The un- weighted score, which reflects the fraction of targets that are still reach- able after removing node A, is   P 1  Q !

However, ex- perimentally testing all possible combinations, even for pairwise inter- actions, is not feasible given the large number of human genes.
Our method provides a viable alternative: rather than performing an experi- mental screen, perform in silico knockdowns of all pairwise combinations, score each pair and then only experimentally test the top-ranking pairs.
To derive a score for pairwise knockdowns, we mimicked experimental studies of genetic interactions in yeast (Collins et al., 2010 Jonikas et al., 2009 Tong et al., 2004). Initial work classified gene pairs as either inter- acting or not with less emphasis on the strength of the interaction (Tong et al., 2004). More recent work has focused on quantifying genetic inter- actions on a continuous scale.
AB Â¼ Pobserved AB  Pexpected AB Ã°7Ãž where AB is the interaction between genes A and B and PAB is the phenotype when both A and B are deleted (Collins et al., 2010). Typically the expected phenotype is defined as the product of the pheno- types observed in the individual single deletions  AB Â¼ Pobserved AB  Pobserved A Pobserved B Ã°8Ãž Using this definition, negative interactions, the type we are primarily interested in because they indicate the pair blocks disease-related pheno- types, occur when the double knockdown has a stronger effect than ex- pected because stronger effects correspond to lower values of Pobserved. AB In yeast experimental work, colony size is a typical phenotype (Collins et al., 2010 Tong et al., 2004) because it approximates growth rate, but other possibilities exist (Jonikas et al., 2009). Single human knockdown screens often use viral load as the phenotype (Ko nig et al., 2010). In our simulations, the score defined in Equation 5 is the in silico phenotype Pobserved. Similar to colony size and viral load, in our scoring function, more significant deletions result in lower values, and it is meaningful to take the product of the scores from two individual deletions.
To calculate Pobserved , we generalized Equation 5 to consider the simultaneous removal of two nodes from the signaling network.

2.6 Data The interaction network contained PPI from BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006), post-translational modifications and PPI from the Human Protein Reference Database (Mishra et al., 2006) and TF-gene binding predictions (Ernst et al., 2010) that were processed as described in (Schulz et al., 2012) (Supplementary Information). The H1N1 data consisted of temporal gene expression (10 time points) (Shapira et al., 2009), five RNAi screens (Bortz et al., 2011 Brass et al., 2009 Karlas et al., 2010 Ko nig et al., 2010 Shapira et al., 2009) and 204 source proteins that detect influenza infection or directly interact with influenza proteins (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, for H5N1, we collected temporal expression data (six time points) (Li et al., 2011), one small-scale RNAi screen (Bortz et al., 2011) and 41 sources (Supplementary Table S4). Source proteins were compiled from the VirHostNet database (Navratil et al., 2009), large-scale host pathogen PPI studies (Shapira et al., 2009 Tafforeau et al., 2011) and the literature (Supplementary Information). We set all of SDREM s parameters to their default values (Gitter et al., 2013) except the number of top-ranked paths used to score nodes and targets, which we set to 1000.
2.7 Gene prioritization algorithms To benchmark SDREM s ability to predict H1N1 RNAi screen effects, we tested two genome-wide gene prioritization algorithms, Endeavour (Aerts et al., 2006 Tranchevent et al., 2008) and Pinta (Nitsch et al., 2009, 2011). Endeavour ranks genes using many lines of evidence such as functional annotations, gene expression, interaction networks, text mining and sequence similarity and combines the individual rankings to create a global prioritization.
Pinta is designed for diseases where a set of seed genes is not available but there are differential gene expression data between healthy and diseased individuals.
It ranks genes based on the expression levels of their neighbors in an interaction network.
The human proteins that interact with H1N1 proteins and differentially expressed genes were provided as input to both Endeavour and Pinta. We used EDGE (Leek et al., 2006) to identify significantly differentially expressed genes by comparing the mock treatment and viral treatment time courses and using 500 null iterations.
Endeavour does not use weights on the input genes so we provided the sources and all genes that had the most significant q-value from EDGE (1.64 E-6). We performed a genome-wide ranking using all lines of evidence.
For Pinta the weight of a gene was  log10Ã°q valueÃž, and all genes were used as input.
Sources were given the same weight as the most significantly differentially expressed genes.
All default settings were used.
3 RESULTS Pathogens infecting cells provide a clear set of sources that ini- tiate the subsequent signaling and transcriptional response.
In particular, many viruses encode only a small number of proteins allowing us to generate specific models for the host response that is triggered by host proteins that detect viral RNA or interact with viral proteins.
To test SDREM s application to such responses, we focus on influenza A viruses because of the rich datasets available and their importance to global health.
The 2009 swine-origin H1N1 virus outbreak received great public attention and was declared a global pandemic in June of that year (Zhang et al., 2010). More recently, research concerning mutations of avian H5N1 influenza that could allow it to be transmitted among mammals via aero- sols has sparked immense controversy (Berns et al., 2012),  highlighting the threat influenza A viruses pose and the need to better understand their interaction with the human immune system.
3.1 H1N1 influenza model The host response to H1N1 influenza is the best profiled in terms of protein interactions, functional screens and transcriptional effects.
We leveraged these data, in particular the temporal gene expression, to construct a dynamic model of the human immune response to H1N1 infection.
SDREM identified the TFs that control this immune response and the signaling path- ways that activate them 36 internal proteins that connect 33 target TFs to upstream nodes in the signaling network (Fig 1 and Supplementary Table S3). These include many proteins known to be involved in immune response such as STAT1 (Shuai and Liu, 2003), seven IRF family members (Honda and Taniguchi, 2006), three NFKB variants (Baeuerle and Henkel, 1994), RELA (Ouaaz et al., 1999) and XBP1 (Martinon et al., 2010). Interestingly several cancer-related proteins such as AR, BRCA1, MYC, SMAD3, SMAD7 and TP53 appear as well.
We used DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) to compute the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) biological process en- richment of the proteins predicted by SDREM, leaving out the sources because they are already known to be relevant to H1N1 and would bias the results.
The most significant GO terms are dominated by processes related to transcriptional regulation due to the prevalence of target TFs in our predictions.
However, beyond these are many highly relevant enriched terms including immune system development [Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P-value 2.18 E-5 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)], response to virus (PÂ¼ 0.0169), virus host interaction (PÂ¼ 0.0289) and immune response (PÂ¼ 0.0431). 3.2 Predicting RNAi screen hits SDREM can rank human genes for their involvement in mediat- ing host response to viral infection.
Even for viruses for which genome-wide screens are available SDREM s models are useful since they provide mechanistic explanations for genes involve- ment in the response.
In addition, the large disagreement among genome-wide screens (Supplementary Table S2) makes such models important in order to distinguish real hits from noise.
Finally, several pathogens, including H5N1, are challenging to work with because they require a biosafety level 3 lab, making it difficult to generate genome-wide RNAi screens.
Using SDREM to predict RNAi screen hits allows researchers to prioritize candidate H5N1 targets, which could later be validated experimentally.
To determine which of the scoring metrics described in Section 2.4 is most predictive of RNAi screen hits, we ran SDREM on the H1N1 data holding out the RNAi screen data from SDREM s input.
We used the metrics to rank all 252 non- target proteins in the model using the number of high-confidence paths that use the node and the network degree to break ties in the ranking.
Given the rankings for each metric, we computed the percentage of correct hits within the top X predictions (where X ranges from 10 to 100). As seen in Table 1, SDREM performed exceptionally well on this task.
To illustrate this, consider the number of correct screen hits in the top 50 ranked genes.
Roughly 20 of these (depending SDREM on the actual metric used), or 40%, are known hits.
Because all the 14 334 proteins in the interaction network are included in SDREM s search, the expected number of known hits in a ran- domly selected set of 50 genes is 3.1.
Thus, using SDREM we obtain a 6.5-fold enrichment in the number of correct hits, indi- cating that such a method can be effectively used to design spe- cific experiments for other viruses as well.
Similar enrichments are seen for other values of X.
The best-performing metric uses only the top paths, allows targets to be activated by any source and uses the weighted score.
Intuitively, including the lower confidence paths can hurt predictive performance because these source target connec- tions may contain false-positive PPI and not actually affect con- nectivity when they are broken.
Our results also suggest that a target can function if it remains connected to any source.
Due to the many parallel paths in the signaling network, it is uncommon for a single node removal to completely disconnect a target.
The weighted variant distinguishes between deletions that do not impact a target at all and those that remove many paths to the target but do not fully disconnect it.
This metric s predictions significantly overlap with the known screen hits at all thresholds, which is also the case for most of the other metrics.
Because the overlaps are significant even for the worst-performing metric when 20 or more genes are predicted, we conclude that the SDREM model itself is a powerful filter for predicting screen hits.
3.3 Comparison with gene prioritization algorithms Having demonstrated that SDREM produces highly accurate rankings of putative RNAi screen hits, we examined whether existing tools could achieve similar performance.
Although other algorithms for connecting sources and transcriptional ef- fects provide candidate pathways (Huang and Fraenkel, 2009 Kim et al., 2011 Ourfali et al., 2007 Schaefer et al., 2013 Tuncbag et al., 2013 Yeang et al., 2004 Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009), they do not rank the pathway members or quantify the effect of knocking them down so it is impossible to compare our knockdown prediction results with these methods.
Instead, we assess Endeavour (Aerts et al., 2006 Tranchevent et al., 2008) and Pinta (Nitsch et al., 2009, 2011), the only two gene priori- tization web servers in a recent benchmark (Bo rnigen et al., 2012) that can prioritize the entire genome and take seed genes instead of disease keywords as input.
We ran Endeavour and Pinta using the differentially expressed genes identified by EDGE (Leek et al., 2006) and the H1N1 sources as input and evaluated the number of correct screen hit predictions at the same thresholds used previously (Table 2). Because the web servers do not provide their full ranked list of genes, we cannot calculate AUC. SDREM outperforms the gene prioritization tools at all thresholds except for the top 20 threshold where Pinta makes the same number of correct predic- tions and Endeavour makes two more.
SDREM s advantage is greatest when assessing the top 100 predictions, at which point SDREM correctly predicts nearly twice as many RNAi screen hits as Pinta and 24% more than Endeavour. When using alter- native methods to select the input genes for Endeavour and Pinta, SDREM s even more pronounced (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Table S5). These results are especially impressive considering Endeavour uses strengths are i231  A.Gitter and Z.Bar-Joseph Fig.1.
The SDREM H1N1 response model.
(a) The regulatory paths summarize the temporal patterns of the differentially expressed genes.
The x-axis is time and the y-axis is log2 fold change.
Split events, green nodes where a regulatory path branches, are annotated with the TFs that are predicted to activate or repress the genes at that time point.
These annotations are placed on the path immediately after the split to indicate whether the TF controls the upper or lower path out of the split.
(b) The signaling paths from sources (red) through internal nodes (blue) to the active TFs (green). Sources directly interact with viral proteins or detect viral presence.
The active TFs are the same TFs shown on the regulatory paths.
Diamonds are RNAi screen hits.
Solid edges are PPI whose orientation has been inferred by SDREM. Dashed edges are post-translational modifications and TF-gene binding interactions, which already have a known orientation additional input that SDREM does not including prior literature via text mining.
These results stress the importance of building mechanistic models that explain why differentially expressed genes are affected by infection instead of directly finding genes that are similar to the differentially expressed genes.
3.4 Predicting host proteins affecting H5N1 viral load Having successfully used SDREM to predict H1N1 screen hits we turned to the independent H5N1 data.
Using the scores from the best metric, we ranked all proteins in the H5N1 SDREM i232  SDREM Table 1.

The number of known screen hits recovered at various thresholds is shown with the significance (in parentheses) calculated using Fisher s exact test.

We also examined the degree of the top-ranked predictions because we expected that high-scoring nodes would have high degree because such nodes are likely to affect a large number of targets when deleted.
Table 3 lists the top 25 H5N1 predictions.
Recall from Equation 5 that the scores denote the fraction of target connectivity remaining after the in silico deletion so lower scores translate to a stronger effect.
Six of the H5N1 predic- tions STAT3, CASP8, HSF1, ERBB3, NRIP1 and PRMT1 are particularly interesting because they are neither known H1N1 RNAi screen hits nor in the top 100 H1N1 pre- dicted hits.
Two of these, CASP8 and ERBB3, have been re- ported to directly interact with H5N1 viral proteins but not H1N1 proteins even though the H1N1-human PPI have much greater coverage, suggesting that they may indeed play distinct roles.
Several top-ranked H5N1 proteins are sources (directly interacting with the viral proteins) or high-degree nodes.
In con- trast, NRIP1 and PRMT1 are neither sources nor of high degree.
Their inclusion in the top predictions is noteworthy because the paths through these nodes affect targets to a greater extent than expected.
NRIP1, also known as RIP140, is involved in inflam- matory response as a coactivator for NFKB (Zschiedrich et al., 2008). PRMT1 methylation of STAT1 is one of the ways in which STAT1 is regulated in the immune system (Shuai and Liu, 2003). 3.5 Screen hits improve the SDREM H1N1 model SDREM can predict screen hits, but when RNAi data are al- ready available they do indeed lead to more accurate SDREM models.
Here we refer to the model reconstructed using all data as the original model and the model obtained after omitting the RNAi data as the no-RNAi model.
Of the 69 signaling proteins and TFs predicted in the original SDREM H1N1 model, 38 (55%) are screen hits versus only 20 of 61 predictions (33%) in the no-RNAi model.
The original and no-RNAi models overlap substantially.
However, some important immune responders, including IRF2 and NFKB1, were only detected in the original SDREM model.
The original SDREM model better corresponds to related annotated pathways as well.
We used DAVID to examine the enrichment of Biocarta pathways (Nishimura, 2001) for SDREM Human model members.
The The informa- Cytomegalovirus and Map Kinase Pathways , tion-processing pathway at the Interferon-beta enhancer , T Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway and Toll-Like Receptor Pathway are enriched in the original model (all with corrected P50.05) but not the no-RNAi SDREM model.
immune-related pathways 3.6 Predicting genetic interactions Genetic interactions are functional interactions between pairs of genes where simultaneous double deletion has a smaller or greater than expected effect.
Humans have tens of thousands of genes, making it impossible to comprehensively screen for all possible genetic interactions in a condition of interest as is done to identify the phenotypic effects of single gene loss.
In contrast, the in silico analysis performed by SDREM can be ex- tended to pairwise or higher-order analysis.
Given its perform- ance on the single knockdown prediction task, the ranked list of pairs identified by SDREM can serve as a starting point for follow-up validation experiments.
Considering the rather disap- pointing agreement between screen hits performed by different labs, such higher-order analysis may be required to accurately and robustly identify targets that can impact disease progression and viral load.
Based on our results for predicting H1N1 screen hits (Table 1), we again consider only the top-ranked paths and allow targets to be activated by any single source.
We used our method to predict genetic interactions that affect H1N1 (Table 4) and H5N1 (Supplementary Table S6) infection.
Condition-specific experi- mental validation is necessary to confirm that these pairs form genetic interactions that impact viral infection, but annotated pathways indicate that some of these pairs do act in parallel in other settings.
For example, RB1 and TP53 are on parallel paths i233  A.Gitter and Z.Bar-Joseph Table 3.

Other predicted pairs such as ILF3 and PA2G4 (fifth on the H5N1 list) are es- pecially interesting because the two proteins are not high-degree nodes in the PPI network.
4 DISCUSSION SDREM is unique in that it combines time series and static data to model both signaling and dynamic regulatory networks.
This allows it to infer, more confidently, the TFs that are at the end points of signaling cascades and control human disease response.
To manage the complexity of human interaction networks, we extended SDREM to leverage gene priors from RNAi screens in its objective function and incorporated several algorithmic im- provements. As we have shown for influenza infection, by recon- structing disease response networks we can accurately identify key signaling pathways and nodes (proteins). SDREM can be applied successfully in many different settings even when the PPI data, node priors or gene expression time points are sparse (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). i234  Given the predicted directed signaling pathways, we can esti- mate the phenotypic effects of knocking down genes by assessing how strongly the downstream TFs are affected.
These techniques can be used to infer putative drug targets for hard-to-study con- ditions (such as H5N1 infection) and for combination of targets, which can lead to more robust treatments.
Successfully predict- ing the effects of pairwise and higher-order gene knockdowns can guide targeted experimental validation, a major contribution because exhaustive pairwise RNAi screening is currently infeas- ible and signaling pathway redundancy can limit the effectiveness of drugs that target individual genes (Logue and Morrison, 2012). Owing to this pathway redundancy and false negatives in the existing RNAi screens, the precision we calculate for SDREM s RNAi effect predictions (Table 1) is conservative.
Many proteins predicted by SDREM (for example STAT1, RELA, NFKB2 and several IRF TFs) are not screen hits but are known to be important to the immune response.
An important advantage of SDREM over previous RNAi screen and host pathogen PPI studies is the ability to infer new pathways from general interaction data.
Previous studies [for example, (Shapira et al., 2009)] and pathway-based GWAS (Wang et al., 2010) often rely on known curated pathways that are incomplete and not always relevant to the disease studied.
In contrast, using condition-specific time series data and sources, SDREM can predict which candidate proteins are involved in the signaling pathways and which are not.
Unlike the gene scores from Endeavour, Pinta and other gene prioritization algorithms that are only defined for single genes, SDREM predicts functional disease genes by modeling the impact of removing a gene from the disease-specific signaling pathways.
This simulated phenotype can be naturally extended to pairs of genes, allowing SDREM to predict genetic inter- actions analogously to experimental approaches.
Existing genetic interaction prediction algorithms require a partial set of known genetic interactions (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012 Qi et al., 2008 Wong et al., 2004 Zhong and Sternberg, 2006), which prevents their application in human.
Furthermore, SDREM s genetic interaction predictions are condition-specific.
Our influenza analysis focused on data from human cell lines, but some of SDREM s most exciting future applications will involve data from individual patients.
We would like to use the extensions presented in this article to enable GWAS data to be used as node priors.
One possible approach we intend to explore is to map SNP P-values to gene scores as in pathway-based GWAS (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, SNPs in non-coding regions with potential regulatory functions could be used to sug- gest which TFs binding is disrupted (Schaub et al., 2012), pro- viding priors for both the network orientation and the temporal expression analysis.
