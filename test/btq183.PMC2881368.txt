Using these models as a platform for the analysis transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic of high throughput data can provide valuable insight into conditional changes in the metabolic activity of an organism.
While transcriptomics and proteomics provide important insights into the hierarchical regulation of metabolic ﬂux, metabolomics shed light on the actual enzyme activity through metabolic regulation and mass action effects.
Here we introduce a new method, termed integrative omics- metabolic analysis (IOMA) that quantitatively integrates proteomic and metabolomic data with genome-scale metabolic models, to more accurately predict metabolic ﬂux distributions.
The method is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem that seeks a steady-state ﬂux distribution in which ﬂux through reactions with measured proteomic and metabolomic data, is as consistent as possible with kinetically derived ﬂux estimations.
Results: IOMA is shown to successfully predict the metabolic state of human erythrocytes (compared to kinetic model simulations), showing a signiﬁcant advantage over the commonly used methods ﬂux balance analysis and minimization of metabolic adjustment.
Thereafter, IOMA is shown to correctly predict metabolic ﬂuxes in Escherichia coli under different gene knockouts for which both metabolomic and proteomic data is available, achieving higher prediction accuracy over the extant methods.
Considering the lack of high-throughput ﬂux measurements, while high-throughput metabolomic and proteomic data are becoming readily available, we expect IOMA to signiﬁcantly contribute to future research of cellular metabolism.

A metabolic network reconstruction is composed of a set of biochemical reactions, and the associations between these reactions and their enzyme- coding genes.
The constraint-based modeling (CBM) computational framework serves to analyze the functionality of these genome scale   To whom correspondence should be addressed.
Using metabolic models as scaffolds for models, enabling the prediction of various metabolic phenotypes in microorganism such as growth rates, nutrient uptake rates, by- product secretions and gene essentiality (Price et al., 2004). CBM has been used for a variety of applications including the comparative metabolic analyses over multiple organisms (Blank et al., 2005 Lee et al., 2009), drug discovery (Gordana et al., 2005), metabolic ﬂux analysis (Rantanen et al., 2008), studies of network evolution (Fong et al., 2005) and metabolic engineering tasks (Pharkya et al., 2004). the analysis of high throughput data such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics suggests the possibility of inferring condition- dependent changes in the metabolic activity of an organism.
Developing computational methods capable of predicting metabolic ﬂux by integrating these data sources with a metabolic network is hence a major challenge of metabolic network modeling.
Previous investigations have already utilized CBM to integrate high-throughput molecular datasets with a metabolic network in a qualitative manner: The methods developed by Åkesson et al. (2004) and Becker and Palsson (2008) use gene expression data to identify genes that are absent or likely to be absent in certain contexts.
They then search for metabolic states that prevent (or minimize) the ﬂux through the associated metabolic reactions.
A recent method by Shlomi et al. (2008) considers data on both lowly and highly expressed genes in a given context, as cues for the likelihood that their associated reactions carry metabolic ﬂux and employs CBM to accumulate these cues into a global, consistent prediction of the metabolic state.
The lack of dependency on a cellular objective is a marked advantage of this approach as the latter is difﬁcult to deﬁne for multi-cellular organisms.
While transcriptomics and proteomics data provides important insight into hierarchical regulation of metabolic ﬂux (representing the control over the maximum activity of enzymes i.e. vmax), metabolomics may provide information on an additional level of regulation called, metabolic regulation (Rossell et al., 2006). The latter denotes the effect of metabolite concentrations on actual enzyme activity through mass action, kinetic and allosteric effects.
A previous CBM method for integrating metabolomic data with a metabolic network model, thermodynamic-based metabolic ﬂux analysis (TMFA) (Henry et al., 2007), derives constraints on reaction directionality from metabolite concentration data based on thermodynamic principles.
Another method by Cakir et al. (2006) integrates quantitative metabolome data with genome-scale models to identify reporter reactions, deﬁned as the set of reactions that respond to genetic or environmental perturbations through coordinated variations in the levels of surrounding metabolites.
Currently, however, there is no CBM method that enables the  The Author(s) 2010.

In this article we introduce a novel CBM method, integrative omics-metabolic analysis (IOMA), for integrating quantitative proteomic and metabolomic data with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict metabolic ﬂux. This is achieved primarily by considering a mechanistic model of reaction rates.
The method is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem (Nocedal and Wright, 2006) geared to ﬁnd a feasible, steady-state ﬂux distribution, such that: (i) a set of stoichiometric mass-balance and enzymatic directionality constraints are satisﬁed (ii) the ﬂux through a core set of reactions for which measured proteomic and metabolomic data exists is as consistent as possible with ﬂux estimations derived via Michaelis Menten-like kinetic rate equations for these reactions.
The latter involves the estimation of missing enzyme kinetic constants, by searching for optimal parameters as part of the optimization problem, as described below.
To examine the predictive performance of IOMA, we applied it to predict metabolic ﬂux for red blood cells (RBC) for which a detailed kinetic model is available for validation (utilizing it to simulate metabolic ﬂux changes following gene knockouts based on artiﬁcially generated proteomic data). As a further validation, we applied IOMA to predict metabolic ﬂux for Escherichia coli under different gene knockouts, utilizing available metabolomic and proteomic data as input, and available experimental ﬂuxes for validation (Ishii, 2007). A comparison of IOMA s performance to that of the commonly used methods of ﬂux balance analysis (FBA) (Fell and Small, 1986 Kauffman et al., 2003 Varma and Palsson, 1994) and minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA) (Segre et al., 2002) shows the signiﬁcant advantage of IOMA in both validation tests.
2 METHODS 2.1 CBM of metabolic network A metabolic network consisting of n metabolites and m reactions can be represented by a stoichiometric matrix, denoted by N, where the entry nij represents the stoichiometric coefﬁcient of metabolite i in reaction j (Price et al., 2004). A CBM model imposes mass balance, directionality and ﬂux capacity constraints on the space of possible ﬂuxes in the metabolic network s reactions through the set of linear equations: N v=0, vlb  v  vub, (1) (2) where v stands for the ﬂux vector for all of the reactions in the model (i.e. the ﬂux distribution). The exchange of metabolites with the environment is represented as a set of exchange reactions, enabling for a pre-deﬁned set of metabolites to be either taken up or secreted from the growth media.
The steady-state assumption represented in Equation (1) constrains the production rate of each metabolite to be equal to its consumption rate.
Enzymatic directionality and ﬂux capacity constraints deﬁne lower and upper bounds on the ﬂuxes and are embedded in Equation (2). In the following, ﬂux vectors satisfying these conditions will be referred to as feasible stead-state ﬂux distributions.
2.2 The IOMA method To associate quantitative measurements of protein and metabolite levels with metabolic ﬂuxes, we used the following Michaelis Menten-like rate equation to estimate the ﬂux v in a reaction transforming a set of substrates S to a set i256 of products P: v= k + cat  e (cid:2) (cid:1) si s si km,si+si (cid:3)  k  cat  e (cid:2) (cid:1) pi p (cid:3) , pi km,pi+pi (3) where Si and Pi denote the concentrations for the i-th substrate and i-th product, respectively, and e denotes the enzyme concentration.
km,si and km,pi denote the dissociation constants for the i-th substrate and i-th product, respectively.
Enzyme turnover rates in the forward and backward directions  are denoted by k cat, respectively.
Given the substrate and product metabolites concentration and their dissociation constants, the following saturation values for the enzyme in the forward and backward directions can be computed as following: + cat and k (cid:2) (cid:1) si s += a (cid:3)  = a , (cid:3). pi km,pi+pi (cid:2) (cid:1) pi p (cid:5) si km,si+si v= e (cid:4) +  k cat   a  k cat a.
(4) Given the above deﬁnitions, the rate Equation (3) takes the following form: To account for proteomics data that reﬂect relative protein levels compared to some reference state (rather than absolute protein concentrations), Equation (4) can be rewritten as following: a (cid:4) (cid:5) (5) +   a v v , + max  max v= e eref + max and v where eref denotes the enzyme concentration in the reference state,  and v max are equal to the corresponding enzyme turnover rates multiplied by eref. Hence, in order to predict the metabolic ﬂux through a certain enzyme given relative concentration level and saturation coefﬁcients (computed given absolute metabolite levels and metabolite dissociation constants), the corresponding vmax value of the enzyme is also required.
We describe a new CBM method that addresses the problem of predicting genome-scale metabolic ﬂux distributions, vj, for a set of k growth conditions (j=1,... ,k), given (Fig. 1): (i) relative enzyme concentrations for a core set of enzymes (denoted E), under the various conditions, ej /eref , where ( j=1,... ,k) and i E (ii) absolute substrate and product metabolite i concentrations for enzymes in E (iii) metabolite dissociation constants.
Concentrations and dissociation constants together enable us to compute enzyme saturation values, aj+ method is formulated as a QP problem that searches for k ﬂux distributions, such that: (i) each ﬂux distribution satisﬁes stoichiometric mass-balance and reaction directionality constraints, (ii) the ﬂuxes through the core reactions (for which proteomic and metabolomic data is given) are as consistent as possible with the estimated rates calculated via Equation (5). The latter is  facilitated by searching for the v max,i parameters for all enzymes i E as part of the QP optimization.
IOMA s QP problem is formulated as following: i where j = 1,... ,k, and i E. The and aj  i i + max,i and v (cid:6) i E (cid:5) (cid:4) εi , var  vj , v min  + max , v max ,εj i s.t.

To account for missing concentration levels of substrate and product metabolites for some enzymes, the presence of noise in both the proteomic and metabolomic data, and the simplifying assumptions employed in the rate equation formalism, the [11:46 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq183.tex] Page: i256 i255 i260  Integrating quantitative proteomics and metabolomics Fig.2.
Precision, recall and accuracy of predicted changes in ﬂuxes between the wild-type and knockout strains in the RBC model, obtained by IOMA (blue) and MOMA (red). The average and standard deviation of the precision, recall and accuracy are shown across the 50 simulation runs in two scenarios.
(a) No ﬂux data is given as input for MOMA and IOMA, hence MOMA relies on random sampling of possible wild-type ﬂux distributions to predict knockout effects.
(b) Exchange ﬂuxes are given as input to both methods, and are used by MOMA to obtain a more reliable prediction of the wild-type ﬂux distribution.
In both test scenarios, IOMA s predictions are signiﬁcantly more accurate.
3 RESULTS 3.1 Predicting gene knockout effects in the red blood cell model As a ﬁrst validation of IOMA, we applied it to predict metabolic ﬂuxes in human erythrocytes.
For this metabolic system, a detailed kinetic model (Jamshidi, 2001) is readily available for validation, by simulating the steady-state metabolic ﬂux after gene knockouts.
This model consists of four basic pathways: glycolysis, pentose- phosphate pathway (PPP), adenosine nucleotide metabolism, and the Rapoport-Leubering shunt, accounting for 48 metabolites, 39 internal reactions and nine exchange reactions.
The set of differential equations in the model, describing the dynamics of metabolite concentration, were solved via the ode15s solver in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.). To generate synthetic proteomic and metaoblomic data that can be used as input to IOMA, and the corresponding ﬂux data for validation, we utilized the RBC kinetic model in the following way: a gene knockout was modeled by restricting the ﬂux through its corresponding reaction to zero.
Random protein levels were drawn from a uniform distribution, reﬂecting up to 5-fold increase or decrease in concentration compared to the wild- type condition.
These protein levels were then used to determine the values in the kinetic model.
To apply IOMA to predict metabolic ﬂuxes for all gene knockouts given a CBM model of RBC metabolism, we provide it with the randomly generated proteomic data and the corresponding steady- state metabolomic data (identiﬁed by the RBC kinetic model) for a core set of 10 reactions whose rate equations (in the kinetic model) are based on Michaelis Menten-like kinetics.
The performance of IOMA is evaluated in terms of predicting signiﬁcant changes in ﬂux between the wild-type strain and each of the knockouts, considering a threshold of 0.001 to deﬁne a signiﬁcant increase or decrease in ﬂux. Repeating the analysis 50 times with random proteomic data provided an average precision of 0.95, recall of 0.93, and an overall accuracy of 0.91 (where accuracy is the rate of true predictions) (Fig. 2a). Similar results were obtained assuming a normal distribution for protein levels with an average precision of 0.96, recall of 0.94, and an overall accuracy of 0.92. i257 Fig.1.
The ﬁgure illustrates the associations between variables in IOMA s optimization problem imposed by the various constraints.
Rows represent enzymes and columns represent growth conditions i.e. the j-th column representing the ﬂux distribution for the j-th condition (denoted by vj. Mass-balance [Equation (6)] and reaction directionality [Equation (7)] create dependencies between ﬂuxes through different enzymes in one condition, irrespectively of all others conditions (i.e. associating ﬂuxes in one column). The enzyme-kinetic constraint [Equation (8)] associates between ﬂuxes through one enzyme in different growth conditions (via the enzyme s  parameters v max, which are condition-invariant), irrespectively of all other enzymes (i.e. associating ﬂuxes in one row). The latter constraint is deﬁned only for a core set of enzymes for which metabolomic and proteomic data is available (marked in blue). The union of both types of row and column constraints in IOMA s optimization indirectly associates between many additional ﬂuxes through various enzymes in different conditions.
+ max and v error εj i variables were added to Equation (8), guaranteeing a feasible solution for the QP problem.
The optimization is hence formulated to minimize the total sum of variance in the error variables for each enzyme across the k conditions.
We chose to minimize the variance of the error variables (and not their total sum) to account for potential metabolic regulation mechanisms that are not explicitly incorporated in the model (e.g. allosteric regulation) and may systematically affect the metabolic ﬂux. The application of IOMA in this article considers additional constraints by utilizing additional datasets given as input for each knockout condition: ﬁrst, for a knockout condition j of an enzyme-coding gene that is not backed up by isozymes in the model, the ﬂux through the corresponding reactions was constrained to zero via the following constraint: ko=0, vj j=1,...,k. Second, the organism s growth rate (denoted vGR) in a knockout condition j is given and is used to constrain the biomass yield rate: vj biomass = vGR, j=1,...,k. Third, experimentally measured exchange ﬂuxes (uptake and secretion rates for several metabolites) were further used to constrain the predicted ﬂux distributions via a two-step procedure: (i) we applied QP for each condition j ( j = 1,... ,k) in order to ﬁnd a feasible steady-state ﬂux distribution vj for which the Euclidean distance to the given exchange ﬂuxes is minimized (ii) we added the following constraints to IOMA s optimization problem, so that the exchange ﬂuxes are ﬁxed at the values predicted in (i): ex= vj vj ex, j=1,......k. The commercial CPLEX solver was used for solving QP problems, on 64-bit machines running Linux. www.cs.technion.ac.il/ tomersh/tools. implementation Matlab IOMA found can be of at [11:46 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq183.tex] Page: i257 i255 i260  K.Yizhak et al. IOMA s prediction accuracy is insensitive to the speciﬁc choice of threshold, with thresholds in the range 0.0001 0.1 yielding 2.5% change in the prediction accuracy.
Notably, applying other ﬂux prediction methods such as FBA and MOMA in this setup, given only metabolomic and proteomic data is problematic: FBA depends on a deﬁnition of a cellular objective function (commonly assumed to be the maximization of biomass yield rate in microbes), which is not available in the RBC model.
MOMA depends on data regarding the wild-type ﬂux distribution, which in this test scenario was not given as input.
Utilizing a sampling technique (Becker et al., 2007) to predict a set of 100 feasible ﬂux distributions for the wild-type strain and applying MOMA to predict the knockout effects starting from each of them resulted in a markedly lower average accuracy of 0.45 (Fig. 2a). To enable further comparison with MOMA, we considered a second test scenario in which the ﬂuxes through exchange reactions (representing the uptake and secretion of metabolites from the growth environment which are easier to measure experimentally) as identiﬁed by the kinetic model, are also given as input to IOMA and MOMA. The ﬂux distribution of the wild-type strain is computed via QP, by searching for a feasible ﬂux vector, satisfying mass-balance and reaction directionality constraints, minimizing the Euclidian distance between the predicted exchange ﬂuxes and those given as input.
MOMA was applied starting from this predicted wild- type ﬂux distribution, utilizing also the given ﬂux rates through the exchange reactions for all knockout conditions (via additional constraints in MOMA s QP formulation). The additional ﬂux data through exchange reactions is also utilized in a similar manner by IOMA as described in the Methods section.
The results show that while MOMA s performance signiﬁcantly improves in this test scenario, reaching an average accuracy of 0.82, IOMA still achieves a statistically signiﬁcant higher accuracy of 0.91 (Fig. 2b) (Wilcoxon P-value = 1.61 10 To test the robustness of IOMA to noise in the proteomic and metabolomic data, we repeated the ﬁrst test scenario (the more challenging one, without using metabolite uptake and secretion rates as input), while adding random noise to both data sources given as input to IOMA. The noise was drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and SD = 10 50% of the true proteomic and metabolomic levels (as obtained from the kinetic simulations). The results show that IOMA still achieves a high accuracy of 0.95 and 0.84, for SD levels of 10 50%, respectively, testifying for IOMA s robustness to noisy measurements.
5). 3.2 Predicting metabolic ﬂuxes in E.coli via the integration of experimental metabolomic and proteomic data As a second validation of IOMA, we applied it to the genome-scale E.coli metabolic network model of Feist et al. (2007) accounting for 1260 metabolic genes, 2382 reactions and 1668 metabolites, to predict metabolic ﬂux distributions for wild-type E.coli K-12 and 23 single-gene knockouts, which cover most viable glycolysis and PPPs knockouts, grown in glucose minimal medium.
As input we utilized experimentally measured absolute protein (mg-protein/g- dry cell weight) and metabolite (mM) concentrations for a core set of 11 reactions, uptake and secretion rates for nine metabolites, and measured growth rates, all taken from the E.coli multi-omics database (Ishii, 2007). Metabolites dissociation constants (km) were i258 Fig.3.
Precision, recall and accuracy of predicted changes in ﬂux between wild-type and following gene knockouts in the E.coli model, obtained by IOMA (blue), FBA (green) and MOMA (red). obtained from the BRENDA database (Bennett et al., 2009). To validate the predicted ﬂux distributions, we utilized experimentally measured ﬂuxes in these knockout strains for 26 reactions in E.coli s central metabolism, also taken from the multi-omics database.
To assess the accuracy of IOMA versus that of MOMA and FBA, we compared their predictions of signiﬁcant increase or decrease in ﬂux for the 26 measured reactions between the wild- type and knockout strains (considering the same threshold of 0.001 to deﬁne signiﬁcant changes in ﬂux as done above). As shown in Figure 3, IOMA achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.54 which is markedly higher than that achieved by FBA and MOMA (0.44 and 0.38, respectively). The prediction accuracy is signiﬁcantly high compared to random predictions, with a hypergeometric P-value 8 for the prediction of increased of 1.26 10 and decreased ﬂuxes compared to the wild-type strain, respectively.
Notably, IOMA s prediction accuracy is insensitive to the speciﬁc choice of threshold (with thresholds in the range of 0.0001 0.1 yielding 5% change in the prediction accuracy of the various methods). 4 and 5.12 10 An example ﬂux distribution predicted by IOMA following the knockout of an enzyme in the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, talB (Transaldolase B), is shown in Figure 4.
The ﬁgure shows that IOMA correctly predicts an increase in ﬂux through most of the enzymes in glycolysis and a decreased ﬂux through enzymes in PPP following the knockout of talB. FBA is only partially correct, predicting an increased ﬂux through both glycolysis and PPP, while MOMA falsely predicts both the increased glycolysis and decreased PPP ﬂuxes. To demonstrate the added value of utilizing both proteomics and metabolomics to infer metabolic ﬂux, we compared IOMA s performance when given both proteomics and metabolomics, to its performance when only one of the sources is given as input.
To utilize IOMA only with proteomic data, we considered zero saturation coefﬁcients (a ) for all enzymes, while for utilizing it only with metabolomic data, we considered a constant expression level for each enzyme across the various conditions (e/eref = 1). We ﬁnd that, quite expectedly, when only a single data and a +   [11:46 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq183.tex] Page: i258 i255 i260  Integrating quantitative proteomics and metabolomics (higher than the accuracy obtained with FBA and MOMA as reported above). 4 DISCUSSION This study presents a novel approach for integrating quantitative proteomic and metabolomic data with a genome-scale metabolic network model to predict ﬂux alterations under different perturbations, based on a mechanistic model for determining reaction rate.
The method predicts feasible ﬂux distributions while accounting for missing concentration levels of substrate and product metabolites for some enzymes, for potential noise in both the proteomic and metabolomic data, and for the simplifying rate equation formalism used.
IOMA is shown to successfully predict changes in ﬂuxes both in E.coli s central metabolism under various genetic perturbations and in a simulated RBC kinetic model, displaying a signiﬁcant improvement versus the commonly used FBA and MOMA methods.
Metabolic ﬂuxes are the most informative and direct indices of the metabolic and physiological state of cells/tissues, and hence, inferring their state in different biological contexts is probably the holy grail of metabolic modeling.
However, in a somewhat spiteful way, while we are facing an ever increasing availability of numerous pertaining high-throughput omics data including transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic measurements, the measurement of ﬂuxes is still very challenging and limited to a small fraction of the reactions present in cells.
Hence, there is an emerging need to continue and develop new computational methods for robustly inferring the ﬂux state, while capitalizing on these other available omics measurements.
In this context, IOMA presents an important step forward in this direction, which hopefully will be followed upon by others.
IOMA proﬁts from the absolute quantiﬁcation of metabolites levels (in contrast to fold changes), that are becoming available, while absolute quantiﬁcation of proteins is not necessary.
Apart from the speciﬁc kind of reaction rate laws utilized in this work, IOMA can be used with a variety of rate laws including different types of regulation or enzyme saturation.
The only restriction is that the rate laws can be represented in the form of Equation (5), where estimates of the terms a can be recomputed based on available data.
Future work for improving ﬂux predictions, could possibly utilize existing information on the thermodynamic constants of reactions to further constraint the model s solution space, following Henry et al. (2007). and a +   IOMA is Another potential application of the prediction of metabolic ﬂux alterations associated with human metabolic disorders (as means for predicting potential clinical biomarkers). Encouragingly, genome-scale human metabolic models have already shown their value in this highly important clinical task [e.g. in the case of inborn errors of metabolism (Shlomi and Cabili, 2009)], but as the methods used up until now have been simple and straightforward, there is certainly much room for improvement ahead, to which methods like IOMA are bound to serve as solid starting points.

An example ﬂux distribution predicted by IOMA following the knockout of talB (Transaldolase B). The network shows E.coli s glycolysis and PPP. Green (red) edges represent a measured increase (decrease) of ﬂux between the wild-type and knockout strains.
The letters F, M and I, represent predictions made by FBA, MOMA and IOMA, respectively, with green (red), representing a predicted increase (decrease) in ﬂux. Predictions of no signiﬁcant change in ﬂux are not shown.
As evident, IOMA correctly predicts the measured pattern of increased ﬂux throughout glycolysis and decreased ﬂux throughout the PPP pathways, with only two mismatches, while FBA and MOMA perform signiﬁcantly worse.
source is used, the accuracy achieved is lower than that obtained when using both data sources together, with the prediction accuracy obtained when using only proteomic or metabolomic down to 0.45 and 0.42, respectively.
Notably, using either data source alone still improves the prediction accuracy upon FBA and MOMA. Gene expression is signiﬁcantly easier to measure than proteomics and was previously shown to signiﬁcantly correlate with protein levels (Lee et al., 2000 Tuller et al., 2007). Here, we ﬁnd an average correlation of 0.65 (with 19 knockouts yielding a signiﬁcant P-value 0.05) between measured gene and protein expression levels across all gene knockouts in the employed dataset (Ishii, 2007). Considering this high correlation, we further explored the predictive performance of IOMA s given gene expression data instead of proteomic data.
The analysis shows that IOMA obtains an accuracy of 0.49 when utilizing gene expression and metabolomics with a hypergeometric P-value 8 for the prediction of increased of 3.15 10 and decreased ﬂuxes compared to the wild-type strain, respectively  4 and 8.63 10 [11:46 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq183.tex] Page: i259 i255 i260  K.Yizhak et al.
