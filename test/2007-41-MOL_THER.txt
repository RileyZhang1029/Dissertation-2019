Because of the size limitation of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, a strategy for delivering the HC and LC separately has been developed.
However, the FVIII HC is secreted 10100-fold less efficiently than the LC.
In this study, we demonstrated that the F309S mutation and enhanced B-domain glycosylations alone are not sufficient to improve FVIII HC secretion, which suggested a role of the FVIII LC in regulating HC secretion.
To characterize this role of the FVIII LC, we compared FVIII HC secretion with and without the LC via post-translational protein trans-splicing.
As demonstrated in vitro, ligation of the LC to the HC significantly increased HC secretion.
Such HC secretion increases were also confirmed in vivo by hydrodynamic injection of FVIII intein plasmids into hemophilia A mice.
Moreover, similar enhancement of HC secretion can also be observed when the LC is supplied in trans, which is probably due to the spontaneous association of the HC and the LC in the secretion pathway.
In sum, enhancing the secretion of the FVIII HC polypeptide may require the proper association of the FVIII LC polypeptide in cis or in trans.
These results may be helpful in designing new strategies to improve FVIII gene delivery.
Received 10 March 2007; accepted 18 June 2007; published online 24 July 2007. doi:10.1038/sj.mt.6300268 IntroductIon Factor VIII (FVIII) plays a critical role in the coagulation cas cade by accelerating the conversion of factor X to factor Xa.
Deficiency in FVIII activity is responsible for the bleeding disorder hemophilia A.1 The current treatment for hemophilia A in the developed countries is intravenous infusion of plasmaderived or recombinant FVIII protein.
Despite this treatment being effective in controlling bleeding episodes, the requirement for frequent infu sion, owing to the short halflife of FVIII (812 hours), makes it inherently costly.
Gene therapy has emerged as an attractive strat egy for the eventual cure of this disease.2,3 However, the progress in delivering FVIII gene using one of the most promising viral vectors, adenoassociated virus (AAV), has lagged behind the progress in delivering coagulation factor IX48 because of the large size of FVIII complementary DNA approaching the packaging capacity of AAV.
Although a dual vector strategy delivering the FVIII heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) separately911 circumvented the pack aging limitation of AAV, it exhibited a severe chain imbalance owing to the inefficient secretion of the FVIII HC, which rendered this approach less efficient and effective.
Therefore, understanding of the causes for limited FVIII secretion is required to improve the results of this strategy.
Although FVIII and factor V share 40% sequence homology in the A and C domains, fulllength FVIII protein by itself is less efficient in terms of secretion than factor V.1214 After translation, FVIII is transported to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticu lum (ER), where it associates with several protein chaperones, including immunoglobinbinding protein (BiP), calnexin, and calreticulin.
The release of FVIII from BiP is an adenosine tri phosphatedependent process, which is one of the main limit ing factors for efficient FVIII secretion.
Calnexin and calreticulin enhance both FVIII secretion and degradation.1214 In the ER, the signal peptide is removed and oligosaccharides are added to the FVIII protein.
Any misfolded protein is degraded in the ER, and the correctly processed FVIII molecules enter the Golgi appara tus.
LMAN1(ERGIC53) is a chaperone protein in the ERGolgi intermediate compartment that is required for efficient FVIII and FV secretion.15 The oligosaccharide content in the B domain The first three authors contributed equally to this study.

E-mail: wxiao@mail.med.upenn.edu Molecular Therapy vol.15no.10oct.2007 1857 The American Society of Gene Therapy Light Chain Enhances Factor VIII Secretion can also affect FVIII secretion.16 Further studies found that the inclusion of the first 226 amino acid residues in the B domain, containing six potential asparaginelinked glycosylation sites, in Bdomaindeleted FVIII (BDDFVIII) increased its secretion tenfold while maintaining the same levels of messenger RNA as BDDFVIII.3,14,1719 Moreover, it has been reported that the com bination of certain modifications in the FVIII coding region can overcome these limitations and improve FVIII secretion 15 to 25fold.3,14 These modifications include (i) use of BDD.FVIII to increase the steadystate messenger RNA levels, (ii) substitution of Phe at postion 309 with Ser in the A1 domain to reduce the affinity to the ER chaperone BiP and the dependence on adenos ine triphosphate for secretion, and (iii) inclusion of six aspara ginelinked oligosaccharides sites in BDDFVIII to increase ER to Golgi transport.
To investigate whether the secretion of the FVIII HC requires the LC in cis, we explored an intein strategy that can ligate the LC to the HC before secretion.
Inteins are the protein equivalent of introns.
They are excised from a precursor protein and the N and Cterminal sequences adjacent to an intein are rejoined with a peptide bond.
Such an exciserejoin reaction of protein splic ing20 is directly analogous to RNA splicing of introns.
However, inteinmediated protein splicing takes place posttranslationally.
The N and Cterminal sequences in the precursor protein are named Nextein and Cextein, respectively.
A mature polypeptide is formed when the exteins are ligated together after the inteins are removed.
Although most inteins are contiguous, there exists a spe cial category of inteins in which the precursor proteins come from two different genes.21 Those inteins are called split inteins.
The two split intein polypeptides, through their structural complemen tarity, can reassemble and catalyze a protein transsplicing reaction to produce a ligated polypeptide.
The Ssp DnaB split intein was used in this study.22,23 In the current study, we determined how the FVIII LC affected the secretion of the HC.
Using the novel protein transsplicing reaction, we were able to compare the secretion of the FVIII HC with and without ligation of the LC.
The results suggest that FVIII LCs are critical in maintaining the proper configuration of HCs for secretion.
Overall, our findings provide valuable information on engineering FVIII protein for both protein therapy and gene therapy of hemophilia A. results F309s and glycosylation modifications alone are not sufficient to improve FVIII Hc secretion The efficiency of FVIII secretion is limited by a number of fac tors, which include messenger RNA instability, interaction with chaperones in the ER, and the requirement for the mannose binding lectin LMAN1 to facilitate ER to Golgi transport.24 F309S and partial B domain sequences exhibited a dramatic enhancing effect on FVIII secretion.
Because the FVIII HC is poorly secreted when expressed alone, we hypothesized that incorporating the above modifications into the HC moiety might improve the secre tion efficiency of the FVIII HC.
To test this hypothesis, we con structed a variety of FVIII plasmids containing different regions of the FVIII gene.
As shown in Figure 1, Phe309Ser mutation and sequences of the B domain containing the six glycosylation sites were incorporated into the FVIII coding region in the expressing plasmid HCN6.
When the respective FVIII expression plasmids were transfected into 293 cells in parallel with their controls, we observed that the FVIII HC was poorly secreted into the medium 48 hours after transfection (Figure 2a and b).
Surprisingly, there was no improvement in the secretion of the FVIII HC even with the Phe309Ser mutation and additional B domain sequences in the HCN6 peptide (Figure 2a).
Secretion of the modified HC in HCN6 was similar to secretion of the unmodified HC and was approximately 520fold less than secretion of BDDFVIII.
This result suggested that the missing LC might play an important role in facilitating the secretion of the HC.
Intein strategy to add the lc polypeptide in trans To further delineate the mechanism of FVIII secretion, we designed an intein strategy to study the effects of the addition of the LC to the HC on the secretion of FVIII molecules.
An illustra tion of this strategy is shown in Figure 3a.
In the expression plas mid HCINT, a 153aminoacid DnaB Nintein was added to the Cterminal of the HC (Figure 1).
In the expression plasmid LC INT, the coding region was arranged in the following configura tion: the 19aminoacid FVIII signal peptide, the 36aminoacid DnaB Cterminal intein, and the full sequence for the FVIII LC.
When these two plasmids were transfected together into 293 cells, a Western blot of the cell lysate 48 hours after transfection using polyclonal antibodies against human FVIII (Figure 3b) showed ligation products at the size of singlechain BDDFVIII (lanes 1, 3, 7, and 8).
In the cells transfected with expression plasmids for LCINT or HCINT alone, we observed slightly higher intracel lular levels of the LC with intein than of the HC with intein (lanes 4 and 5).
When these two plasmids were cotransfected at ratios of 9:1 or 1:1 of pLCINT to pHCINT (lanes 6 and 7), the amount of the HC with intein was considerably less than the amount of the LC polypeptide, which suggested that the majority of HC poly peptides probably were consumed in the transsplicing reaction.

1858 www.moleculartherapy.org vol.15no.10oct.2007 The American Society of Gene Therapy Light Chain Enhances Factor VIII Secretion the HC was in excess supply.
Because the ligated FVIII molecules can be secreted, the intensity of the bands corresponding to the singlechain BDDFVIII may not reflect the amount of single chain FVIII generated through ligation.
The amount of secreted FVIII was analyzed in more detail in later experiments.
On the basis of consumed proteinsplicing substrates, the results sug gested that intein can mediate an efficient intracellular FVIII liga tion reaction that resulted in the addition of the LC to the HC before FVIII secretion.
lc improves Hc secretion We next examined whether the addition of the LC through a trans-splicing reaction could lead to improvement in HC secre tion.
After the plasmids expressing HCN6INT and LCINT had been cotransfected into 293 cells in parallel with positive and negative controls, FVIII antigen levels in the medium and in the cell lysates were analyzed by enzymelinked immunosor bent assay (ELISA).
We employed the ratio of secreted FVIII to intracellular FVIII as an index for secretion efficiency.
As shown in Figure 4, the LC showed a much higher secretion effi ciency index.
The amount of the FVIII LC expressed from the LCINT plasmid and secreted in the medium was 18 times more than that in the cytoplasm.
In contrast, the HC polypeptide was scarcely secreted, even though the HCN6INT expression vector included six glycosylation sites and the F309S mutation.
When the LCINT expression plasmid was included in the transfection, the expressed FVIII LC would go through the same secretion pathway as the HC fragment and undergo the splicing reaction.
The addition of the LC to the HC improved the secretion of the HC to the level of BDDFVIII secretion, though not to the level of FVIII LC secretion.
This result suggested that the LC was critical in promoting FVIII HC secretion and explained why the HC by itself did not secrete efficiently.
Additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that the FVIII LC facilitates HC secretion is presented in Figure 5.
This experi ment showed the amount of the HC secreted in medium with or without the LC in cis.
HC secretion was improved when HCINT was cotransfected with LCINT, but still at a lower level than that of BDDFVIII.
However, additional B domain sequences with six glycosylation sites and F309S mutation had enhancing effects when the LC sequence was ligated to the modified HC.
Although we did not observe a fivefold to tenfold expression as reported elsewhere,14 HCN6 consistently outperformed BDDFVIII in secretion in all repeated experiments.

Molecular Therapy vol.15no.10oct.2007 1859 The American Society of Gene Therapy Light Chain Enhances Factor VIII Secretion To evaluate whether the LC can enhance FVIII HC intein polypeptide secretion in trans, we constructed a plasmid pLC (Figure 1) that expresses a functional LC without intein.
The LC fragment from this plasmid would not be ligated to the expressed HC intein.
As shown in Figure 6, the mere presence of the LC during the secretion process had no influence on HCINT or HCN6INT secretion.
However, cotransfection of HC+LC, HC N6+LC into 293 cells showed a different result (Figure 6).
The LC efficiently improved HC secretion even in trans, although the level remained lower than that for BDDFVIII.
In contrast, HCN6 secretion was improved very little in the presence of the LC.
This suggested that the additional B domain sequence attached to the HC polypeptide alone had a negative effect on the interaction of the HC with the LC.
Therefore, the enhancing effect of the LC on HC secretion may depend upon the substrates.
Only FVIII HC molecules with proper interaction with the LC can be enhanced in secretion.
the FVIII lc augmented FVIII Hc secretion in vivo To examine whether the FVIII LC could facilitate HC secretion in vivo, expression plasmid pHCINT, pLCINT, or pHCINT+ pLCINT was introduced into the livers of hemophilia A mice by hydrodynamic injection.
Plasmid pCMVFVIII, which expresses fully functional BDDFVIII, was included as a positive control.
Twentyfour hours later, mouse plasma was collected.
Expression of circulating FVIII was determined by onestage activated partial thromboplastin time assay.
The results are shown in Figure 7a.
ELISA for human FVIII was performed using a sheep antihuman FVIII as capture antibody and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated polyclonal antibody as detection antibody (Figure 7b).
As shown in Figure 7a, the control groups injected with pLCINT alone or pHCINT alone did not show any clotting activity.
However, when these two plasmids were injected together, they produced a very high level of FVIII clotting activity, reaching 50% of the level in the positive control group receiving BDDFVIIIexpressing plas mid.
In Figure 7b, the different levels of FVIII antigen secreted by these constructs are shown.
Although the clotting activities differed dramatically among pCMVFVIII, pHCINT+pLCINT, and pLCINT (LC) injections, there was not much difference at the protein levels.
This result suggests that 50% of FVIII proteins expressed though inteinmediated ligation were active and con tained the FVIII HC.
It confirms that restoration of the FVIII LC to the HC polypeptide can significantly increase the secretion of functional FVIII protein.

1860 www.moleculartherapy.org vol.15no.10oct.2007 The American Society of Gene Therapy Light Chain Enhances Factor VIII Secretion dIscussIon FVIII is a protein that secretes inefficiently compared with simi lar proteins such as factor V.1,13 Despite the overall low efficiency of secretion of singlechain FVIII or Bdomaindeleted FVIII protein compared with factor V, the HC and the LC polypep tides maintain a 1:1 stoichiometry.
This suggests that the FVIII HC and LC must have overcome the secretion hurdle together.
Owing to the limited packaging capacity of AAV vectors, split ting FVIII coding sequences into two AAV vectors is a practical approach to gene therapy.911 We think this approach is particu larly valuable for therapy of hemophilia A using recombinant AAV vectors.
Previous studies have shown that a major problem associated with this approach is chain imbalance,911 which is at least partially attributable to inefficient secretion of the HC not in association with the LC.
Such chain imbalance not only decreases the amount of active FVIII protein in circulation but also may destabilize the host cells and induce apoptosis.25 Our results confirmed that FVIII HC secretion was almost two logs less efficient than LC secretion.10 This biologically inherent dis crepancy can scarcely be solved by manipulating promoters and vector doses.
Previous studies have pointed out that the interactions between cellular chaperones and elements in the FVIII HC limit FVIII secretion.3,1315 Although there is a difference between full length FVIII and Bdomaindeleted FVIII at the transcription level, we did not observe significant differences between the HC and LC expression vectors at the transcription level using quan titative realtime polymerase chain reaction (data not shown).
In Figure 3, the Western blot analysis of HC and LC polypeptides shows that the intracellular level of the HC is about onefold to twofold lower than that of the LC.
Thus, the biosynthesis of the HC is unlikely to be the main factor that causes the dramatic dif ference between the levels of the secreted FVIII LC and HC.
The current perception is that secretion is the main hurdle to obtaining a high level of FVIII or the FVIII HC in plasma.
So far it is unclear why the HC is so defective in terms of secretion.
To improve FVIII secretion and solve the chain imbalance issue, we took advantage of the success of FVIII bioengineering, which showed promise not only in improving FVIII functions, including halflife and stability, but also in reducing antigenicity and improving FVIII secretion and production.26,27 The engineered Bdomaindeleted FVIII has been commercially available to hemophilia patients.
Pipes group recently showed that the F309S modification and the addition of up to six glycosylation sites in the B domain could improve FVIII secretion by almost 20fold.3,14 However, such modifications did not have similar effects in terms of improving FVIII HC secretion (Figure 2).
One possible explanation is that the FVIII HC alone assumes a different configuration and folds improperly without the FVIII LC in the ER or the Golgi apparatus.
Therefore, the FVIII HC alone does not follow the same pathway for secretion as intact singlechain FVIII molecules with the LC moiety.
This leads to the intracellular retention of the FVIII HC and eventual degradation of FVIII protein.
The results in Figure 4 support this hypothesis.
In this study, we successfully introduced intein as a tool to study the mechanism of FVIII secretion.
As an autocatalytic reaction, inteinmediated trans-splicing avoided any require ment for other cellular enzymes and cofactors.20 The accurate and efficient inteinmediated transsplicing reaction allowed us to compare the secretion of the HC alone and the HC joined with the LC in the ER or the Golgi apparatus.
The role of the FVIII LC in cis, along with the HC, during FVIII heavy secretion high lighted a serious defect in the expression of FVIII using the dual vector strategy.
The demonstration of inteinmediated seamless regeneration of FVIII protein in this study could offer an alterna tive strategy for the dualvector approach to the delivery of the FVIII gene using small gene transfer vectors such as AAV vectors.
Using this strategy, one vector could encode the first half of the FVIII gene and the second vector could encode the LC fragment.
This new scheme may allow the FVIII LC to be attached to the HC polypeptide before secretion.
The in vivo testing in Figure 7a using hydrodynamic injection showed 50% functional FVIII using this method, as compared with singlechain FVIII mol ecules, which suggested that this strategy warrants further study for human gene therapy.

Molecular Therapy vol.15no.10oct.2007 1861 The American Society of Gene Therapy Light Chain Enhances Factor VIII Secretion It is worth noting that the LC was able to enhance HC secre tion in trans (Figure 6).
The cotransfection of the HC and the LC greatly improved the amount of the HC detected.
An alternative explanation is that the LC may also affect the HCs stability (half life) and rate of synthesis.
It has been reported that vWF increases FVIII halflife in vivo.
Whether the LC has similar effects remain unclear, especially in vitro.
The assays employed in this study demonstrated that mainly stable (ELISA) and functional FVIII was secreted (activated partial thromboplastin time assay).
In contrast, HCN6, HCINT exhibited little or no ability to enhance secretion by the LC, which suggests that additional sequences in the HC, either native FVIII amino acids or foreign sequences, may have altered the ability of the FVIII HC to interact with the LC.
This may imply that an HC molecule with enhanced interaction with the LC will be a better choice for gene therapy.
FVIII secretion follows a very delicate pathway.13 Mutations and modifications in either the HC or the LC could easily dis rupt the interactions between the HC and the LC and therefore reduce the enhancing effects of the LC on HC secretion.
As shown in Figure 6, the LC did not show an enhancing effect on HCINT, HCN6, and HCN6INT, as it did on the HC.
One possibility is that the additional sequence after the HC, whether it is intein or the native B domain sequence, had an inhibitory effect on the interactions between the HC and the LC.
The enhancing effect in cis (LCINT+HCN6INT) suggested that the B domain sequence did not inhibit LC and HC interaction per se.
The trans splicing reaction may have altered the configuration of the LC and HC complex.
Thus, it is not surprising that the same B domain sequences could have an inhibitory effect on secretion with the LC in trans while improving FVIII secretion with the LC in cis (Figure 6).
This result demonstrated that the enhancing effects of the LC will depend on the type of HC molecules.
By the same token, a singlepoint mutation in the LC may also be able to dis rupt FVIII folding and secretion.
Previous studies have shown that missense mutations in the C2 domain affected intracellular protein trafficking.13,28 Although we did not construct many mutants to study this, the point mutations in the human hemophilia A muta tion database strongly support this hypothesis.29,30 In this data base, point mutations are scattered almost evenly throughout the whole FVIII LC.
For example, L1756V, G1760R, A1779P, S1888R, R1941Stop, and many other mutations led to less than 1% of FVIII antigen being detected in the patients.
All these data point to the inevitable conclusion that a proper LC is essential for efficient FVIII secretion.
Proper utilization of the enhancing effect of the LC would greatly affect the efficiency of FVIII delivery.
We demonstrated the enhancing effect of the FVIII LC on the secretion of the HC both in cis and in trans.
This information will be useful for designing future strategies for split delivery of FVIII.
To take advantage of either in cis and in trans enhancing effects requires both LC and HC vectors to be presented in the same cells.
Thus, highly efficient AAV vectors that can carry both vectors equally into every cell will be desirable.
Because the trans effect of the LC on HC secretion was at a similar level as in cis, it makes sense to emphasize novel HC or LC molecules with better enhancing effects rather than to introduce an intein, albeit small, to complicate immune responses to the gene delivery in the host tissues or organs.
MAterIAls And MetHods FVIII expression plasmids construction.
Human FVIII complementary DNA was used in all expression constructs in this study.
The expression of FVIII was directed by either a cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) or a human actin promoter with a CMV enhancer (CB).31 For direct compar isons in the experiments performed in this study, all constructs were under the same promoter.
The intein sequence was derived from the previously characterized Ssp DnaB split intein.22,23 The pCMVHCINT and pCMV LCINT plasmids were constructed by fusing appropriate fragments of the human FVIII complementary DNA and the intein coding sequence and inserting the fusion gene in the previously characterized pXX expression vector.32 The fusion gene of pCMVHCINT encodes a fusion protein con sisting of the first 779 amino acids of FVIII (including its 19aminoacid signal peptide), a 3aminoacid GluSerGly linker, and the first 106 amino acids of the intein.
The fusion gene of pCMVLCINT encodes a fusion protein consisting of the 19aminoacid signal peptide of FVIII, the last 50 amino acids of the intein, a 3aminoacid SerIleGlu linker, and the last 693 amino acids of FVIII.
The plasmids pCBHCINT and pCBLCINT were made by replacing the promoters in pCMVHCINT and pCMVLCINT with a CB promoter.
The plasmids expressing human FVIII HC (pCMV HC, pCBHC) and LC (pCMVLC, pCBLC) were constructed by replac ing the promoters in plasmids of pAAVhFVIIIHC and pAAVhFVIIILC with a CMV promoter or a CB promoter.9,10 The plasmid pHCN6 was constructed by replacing the HC fragment in pCBHC or pCMVHC with similar fragments with six glycosylation sites from F309S/226aa/N6.14 The plasmid pHCN6INT was similarly derived from pHCINT.

HEK 293 and COS cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (100 g/ml) at 37 C in a humid environment supplied with 5% CO2.
Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufac turers instructions.
Alternatively, a transfection procedure using calcium phosphate precipitation was carried out as described previously.8,33 After transfection, the cells were grown for 1224 hours in Dulbeccos modi fied Eagles medium with 10% fetal bovine serum to minimize cell death.
The cells were then maintained in OPTIMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) medium for 2472 hours before the medium was collected and the secreted FVIII antigens were analyzed.
For direct comparison, a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid was also included in the transfection mix to ensure similar transfection efficiency.
We used both COS cells and 293 cells for our experiments.
After 293 cells were confirmed to produce similar results to COS cells, most experiments were carried out using 293 cells.
Animal procedures.
Exon 16 FVIII knockout mice were obtained from Dr. Haig Kazazian (University of Pennsylvania).8,33 All mice were housed in a specific pathogenfree environment with normal diet.
All surgical pro cedures involving mice were in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under approved protocols at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia.
For hydrodynamic injection, animals were injected via the tail vein with 2.0 ml saline containing 200 g columnpurified plasmids in 5 10 seconds.34,35 The animals were allowed to recover before being retur ned to the cages.
Blood was collected at 2448 hours after hydrodynamic injection by tail clip using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant at a final concentration of 0.38% (wt/vol).
The blood samples were then centri fuged at 4 C for 10 minutes at 9,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge.
The plasmas were then collected and used for FVIII assays.
Quantitative analysis of FVIII antigen.
FVIIIHC and FVIIILC antigen were determined using chainspecific ELISAs.
For the human FVIII ELISA, matchedpair antibody sets for human FVIII antigen were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN).
Both detection 1862 www.moleculartherapy.org vol.15no.10oct.2007 The American Society of Gene Therapy Light Chain Enhances Factor VIII Secretion and capture antibodies were sheep antihuman FVIII immunoglobulin G. The linear range of this assay is from 3 to 100% reference human FVIII as determined by the manufacturer.
For human HCspecific ELISA, Nunc Maxisorp (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) plates were coated with 2 g/ml HCspecific monoclonal antibody ESH5 (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT).
Samples and standards were diluted in OPTI MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Samples and standards (100 l/well) were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.
After washing, a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated sheep antihuman FVIII antibody F8CEIAD (100 l/well, 2 g/ml; Affinity Biologicals, Ancaster, Canada) was added, and the plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.
After a final wash the antigen was detected using 2,2azinobis[3ethylbenzthiazoline 6sulfonic acid] substrate (Roche, Germany) and the absorbance read at 405 nm.
The hFVIIILC ELISA was performed similarly, with the following changes: the capture antibody was 2 g/ml monoclonal antibody to human FVIII LC N55195M (Biodesign International, Saco, ME); the detection anti body was 26 g/ml sheep antihuman FVIII antibody from Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT), followed by 2 g/ml horseradish per oxidaseconjugated rabbit antisheep immunoglobulin G (H+L) from Bio Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA).
For all ELISAs, the standard used was Refacto (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA), recombinant BDDFVIII.
Biologically active FVIII in media and plasma was measured using the activated partial thromboplastin time assay as previously described.8,9,33 Refacto (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) was used as the standard.
To measure the intracellular level of FVIII antigen, the cells were harvested from tissue culture dishes.
The cell pellets after centrifugation were resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline with protease inhibitors and sonicated ten times in a Branson Sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT) under level two with 50% output.
Then the samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 12,000g to remove cell debris.
The supernatant was collected and an equal amount (i.e., 100 l) of supernatant for each sample was used for ELISA following the procedure described above.
Western blot analysis of FVIII.
To analyze intracellular FVIII antigen, cells transfected with FVIII plasmids were lysed with radioimmunopre cipitation buffer (50 mmol/l TrisHCl pH 7.4,150 mmol/l NaCl, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride,1 mmol/l EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate).
After sonication to break the genomic DNA, an equal volume of 2 sample buffer was added and boiled for 2 minutes.
The resulting samples were analyzed using 6% or 412% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting.
After the membrane was blocked overnight in phosphatebuffered saline/10% skim milk pow der/0.3% Tween20, a sheep antihFVIII antibody, SAF8C (1:1,000 dilu tion; Enzyme Research Laboratories, IN), was added and the sample was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.
The membrane was washed, incubated with a rabbit antisheep antibody (1:2,000 dilution; BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, CA)), and developed using an enhanced chemilu minescent substrate (AmershamPharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).
