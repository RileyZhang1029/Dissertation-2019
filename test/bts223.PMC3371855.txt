Accurate assignment of the secondary structure elements is therefore an important problem.
Although many approximate solutions of the secondary structure assignment problem exist, the statement of the problem has resisted a consistent and mathematically rigorous deﬁnition. A variety of comparative studies have highlighted major disagreements in the way the available methods deﬁne and assign secondary structure to coordinate data.
Results: We report a new method to infer secondary structure based on the Bayesian method of minimum message length inference.
It treats assignments of secondary structure as hypotheses that explain the given coordinate data.
The method seeks to maximize the joint probability of a hypothesis and the data.
There is a natural null hypothesis and any assignment that cannot better it is unacceptable.
We developed a program SST based on this approach and compared it with popular programs, such as DSSP and STRIDE among others.
Our evaluation suggests that SST gives reliable assignments even on low-resolution structures.

The α-helix and β-sheets were among the ﬁrst structural motifs predicted from ﬁrst principles of stereochemistry by Pauling and Corey (1951). We now know these speciﬁc motifs are almost ubiquitous across the corpus of known structures.
Eventually, other repetitive motifs were also identiﬁed, and the alphabet of secondary structures was expanded to include 310-helix, π-helix, β-turn, γ -turn, -turn and β-bulges, among other minor elements.
In what follows, we use the term secondary structure to include both the classical helices and sheets, and other common substructural elements.
Accurate assignment of secondary structure of proteins from coordinate data is an important and a challenging problem (Andersen and Rost, 2009). Secondary structure underpins the architectural organization in proteins.
It simpliﬁes the complex atom-level description of proteins and is therefore the key to generation of schematic diagrams of their three dimensional (3D) folding patterns (Lesk and Hardman, 1982 Richardson, 1981). They are central in training methods geared for predicting secondary structure from   To whom correspondence should be addressed.
amino acid sequence (Andersen and Rost, 2009). They form a linchpin to efﬁcient methods for structural comparison and analysis (Kamat and Lesk, 2007 Konagurthu et al., 2008). Over the last 30 years, many programs were developed to address the problem of assigning secondary structure to protein coordinate data.
A broad classiﬁcation can be made of the assignment strategies: (i) methods that use distance and angle proﬁles of local fragments (ii) methods that detect hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms (iii) methods that use 3D geometry of local fragments and (iv) methods that approximate the backbone trace with a set of straight lines.
The following reviews some of the major earlier contributions to the literature of this problem.
Levitt and Greer (1977) were the ﬁrst to generate an automatic method for secondary structure assignment, based on distance and dihedral angle proﬁles of Cα atoms over a sliding window of four residues.
P-SEA (Labesse et al., 1997) is another method in this category which assigns secondary structural states using a short Cα distance mask and two Cα dihedral angle criteria.
PROSS (Srinivasan and Rose, 1999) proposes an assignment based solely on backbone dihedral angles.
Xtlsstr (King and Johnson, 1999) calculates backbone dihedral angles and distances and assigns secondary structural types that would be consistent with interactions of amide-amide groups observed from circular dichroism of a protein in ultraviolet range (Andersen and Rost, 2009). More recently, PALSSE (Majumdar et al., 2005) was designed to delineate protein structure into helices and strands, mainly using distance and torsion angle constraints to identify core elements which are later extended to longer segments.
KAKSI (Martin et al., 2005) is based on Cα distances and backbone dihedral angles and designed primarily to show concordance with the manual assignments found in the protein data bank (PDB). The most popular method in this space is Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) developed by Kabsch and Sander (1983). DSSP is based on detecting hydrogen bonds between nitrogen and carbonyl groups along the protein polypeptide chain using a Coulomb approximation of the hydrogen-bond energy function (Andersen and Rost, 2009). Many now consider this method a standard for secondary structural assignment (Martin et al., 2005). Since DSSP was published, several methods have been designed that rely on computing the hydrogen-bond energy between backbone atoms.
STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995) is among the successful variants of DSSP which uses a modiﬁed hydrogen-bond energy function as well as backbone dihedral angles to compute its assignment.
SECSTR (Fodje and Al-Karadaghi, 2002) is another variant which improves the detection and assignment of π- helices which both DSSP and STRIDE have difﬁculty characterizing (Martin et al., 2005). The Author(s) 2012.

[19:58 28/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts223.tex] Page: i97 i97 i105  Copyedited by: MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: A.S.Konagurthu et al. There are other methods which assign secondary structure using 3D features in a protein structure.
Richards and Kundrot (1988) describe a method, DEFINE-S, to assign secondary structure using local geometry of ideal secondary structures.
The P-CURVE (Sklenar et al., 1989) algorithm uses an helicoidal axis approach derived from a series of peptide planes to assign secondary structure.
The VoTAP (Dupuis et al., 2004) algorithm relies on Voronoi tessellation of a residue contact map and then matching the contact map proﬁles to a consensus assignment of secondary structures by methods like DSSP and STRIDE.
In the last category are indirect methods, such as STICK (Taylor, 2001) and PMML (Konagurthu et al., 2011) which work by approximating the Cα spatial trace using a set of lines.
These methods seek the best approximation of the protein backbone using piecewise lines.
Only as a post-process to this approximation, each line segment is indirectly attributed a secondary structural type based on criteria such as the average rise and pitch of the Cα atoms within the segment.
These approaches solve a related yet different problem, namely the best line approximation of the protein chain.
Consistent with this large number of proposed methods, assignment of secondary structure has been recognized to be an inexact process (Cuff and Barton, 1999). Previous comparative studies have highlighted the difﬁculties of existing programs to assign secondary structure consistently (Andersen and Rost, 2009 Colloc h et al., 1993 Cuff and Barton, 1999 Martin et al., 2005 Zhang et al., 2008). These disagreements can be major as shown by Colloc h et al. (1993) where the percentage of agreement between DSSP, DEFINE-S and P-CURVE was only 63% on a residue basis.
It has been observed that most disagreements arise in the terminal regions of the assigned secondary structural elements.
Reﬂecting on this problem Robson and Garnier (1986) comment [as quoted by Martin et al. (2005)]: In looking at a model of a protein, it is often easy to recognize helix and to a lesser extent sheet strands, but it is not easy to say whether the residues at the ends of these features be included in them or not.
In addition, there are many distortions within such structures so that it is difﬁcult to assess whether this represents merely a distortion, or a break in the structure.
In fact, the problem is essentially that helices and sheets in globular proteins lack the regularity and clear deﬁnition found in the Pauling and Corey models.

(Fig. 1.) 2 OVERVIEW OF MML CRITERION The MML criterion provides an information theoretic objective for problems of inference where the goal is to ﬁnd the best explanation (or theory, hypothesis, model) for a set of observed data (Wallace and Boulton, 1968). MML relies on quantifying the amount of information required to convey losslessly the observed data in an explanation message.
The best hypothesis is the one which can convey the entire data set in the shortest possible explanation message.
More formally, for some observed data D and a hypothesis H that offers an explanation of the data D, Bayes s theorem (Bayes and Price, 1763) gives P(H &D)= P(H ) P(D H )= P(D) P(H D) the details of Given the complexity of individual protein structures, it is not surprising that the secondary structure assignment problem has resisted a mathematically rigorous deﬁnition. The effect can be seen in the use of a variety of deﬁnitions by the existing tools, although all of them are reasonable.
In this study, we describe an approach, SST, to the secondary structure assignment problem using minimum message length (MML) inference (Wallace and Boulton, 1968). Linking statistical inference with data compression, the goal is to communicate losslessly the coordinates of a protein using a two-part message.
The ﬁrst part transmits the secondary structure assignment as a hypothesis about the coordinates.
The second-part transmits the details of coordinates not explained by the hypothesis.
This gives rise to statistically robust objective function to optimize: ﬁnd the best hypothesis on the coordinate data that minimizes the total two-part message length.
SST assigns secondary structure segments of the following types: α, 310 and π-helix (including left-handed versions of all these helices when they occur), sharp turns, β-strands and others (coil). SST in a post-processing step merges consecutive structures where i98 where P(H ) is the prior probability of hypothesis H , P(D) is the prior probability of data D, P(H D) is the posterior probability of H given D, and P(D H ) is the likelihood.
Using Shannon s mathematical communication (Shannon, 1948), the amount of information for an explanation of the data D with the hypothesis H is given by theory of I(H &D)= I(H )+I(D H )= I(D)+I(H D) where I(x)= log2(P(x)) gives the optimal code length to convey some event x whose probability is P(x). This immediately gives an objective means to compare competing hypotheses.
For hypotheses H1 and H2 on the same data D, we have I(H1 D) I(H2 D)= I(H1)+I(D H1) I(H2) I(D H2)  It follows that the best hypothesis H over all competing hypotheses  )+I(D H is the one where the expression I(H ) is minimized.
A concrete realization of the MML framework comes from describing it as a communication process between an imaginary transmitter (Alice) and receiver (Bob) connected over [19:58 28/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts223.tex] Page: i98 i97 i105  Copyedited by: MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: a Shannon channel.
Alice s objective is to send the observed data D using an explanation message in a form such that Bob can receive and decode the data D precisely as Alice sees it.
Alice and Bob agree on a codebook containing the general rules of communication composed solely of common knowledge about typical, hypothetical data.
Anything that is not a part of the codebook must be strictly transmitted as a part of the message.
If Alice can ﬁnd the best hypothesis H on the data, Bob will receive a decodable explanation message most economically: The best inference about the data is the hypothesis that minimizes the total message length.
Alice sends the explanation message of D in two parts.
In the ﬁrst  , she could ﬁnd on the ) bits.
In the second, she transmits the details of , taking I(D H ) bits (i.e. ). Notice that MML inference gives a natural )), and its goodness  part, she transmits the best hypothesis, H data D taking I(H  the observed data D not explained by H  the deviations from H trade-off between hypothesis complexity (I(H of ﬁt to the data (I(D H For a comprehensive resource on MML see Wallace (2005). )). 3 THE DESIGN OF THE COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK ,py i Protein coordinates for a single-polypeptide chain are represented as an ordered set of 3D points of the form P = p1,  ,pn , where any pi corresponds to the ith Cα coordinate along N- to C-terminus of the protein chain.
Each pi deﬁnes a 3D real-valued vector (px ,pz i ) i in Angstrom (Å) units, where each component of the vector comes speciﬁed (in the PDB) to three positions after the decimal place.
Therefore, in this work, we treat the accuracy of measurement of the data as =0.001 Å (independent of the actual accuracy of the experimental structure determination). The transmitter (Alice) has to send a message to the receiver (Bob) who will then be able to reconstruct the original data from the encoded explanation message exactly.
For coordinate data from the PDB, Bob will reconstruct each coordinate of each atom to the original precision of three digits after the decimal point.
3.1 Null model description of a protein coordinate data MML gives a natural hypothesis test: The null-model corresponds to transmitting the data raw.
If any hypothesis H on the data takes longer than the null model, then clearly H is unacceptable.
However, the statement of the raw null model message (without any hypothesis) has to be economical it must not be willfully inefﬁcient. The construction of an efﬁcient null model for protein coordinates relies on the observation that the distance between successive Cα atoms in a protein chain is highly constrained at about 3.8Å with only small deviations from this value.
The method starts with the transmission of the ﬁrst Cα coordinate p1 in any choice of encoding that both transmitter and receiver agree on.
(Stating p1 simply adds a constant overhead to the message length, whether transmitted via a null model message or an explanation using a hypothesis.
A simple way to do away with this overhead is for Alice to translate P such that p1 becomes the origin.
p1 then need not be transmitted explicitly in the message and can be treated implicitly a part of the codebook.) Alice then computes the observed distance r between the successive Cα coordinates p1 and p2. This distance r can be communicated efﬁciently using an encoding over a normal distribution N (μ,σ ) with a certain ﬁxed mean (μ) and a small standard deviation MML inference of protein secondary structure (σ ) around it.
Based on the prior knowledge of Cα Cα distances between successive atoms, these values are set to μ=3.8Å and σ =0.4Å and are considered to be part of the codebook. The probability density of a random variable x over a normal distribution with mean μ and a standard deviation σ is given by: N (x μ,σ )= 1(cid:2) (2π)σ e  (x μ)2 2σ 2 Therefore, the probability of stating any distance r to an accuracy of  (given (cid:4) σ ) using the above normal distribution is P(r)=  N (x= r μ,σ ). This implies (cid:2) (cid:4) The optimal code length to transmit r is given by log2(P(r)) bits: P(r)= (cid:3)(cid:2)  (r μ)2 (2π)σ 2σ 2 e I(r)=log2 (2π)σ   + (r μ)2 2σ 2 log2 e bits.
(1) Note that Bob will not be able to recover p2 simply from the transmitted information of p1 and the distance r between p1 to p2. p2 can lie anywhere on the surface of a sphere of radius r centered on p1. The precise location of p2 stated to  can be transmitted by ﬁrst dividing the surface area of this sphere into cells each of area 2.
This results in 4πr2/ 2 such cells distributed uniformly on the surface.
These cells can be numbered using a convention that Alice and Bob both agree upon (as a part of the codebook). On the basis of this discretization of the sphere s surface area, Alice transmits the cell number c in which the observed p2 falls within.
Assuming uniform probabilities, the probability that the point p2 falls in a cell number c is given by P(c)= 2/4πr2. Following from this, the code length to state the cell number is: (cid:3) (cid:4) I(c)= log2  2 4πr2 =log2(4πr2) 2log2  bits.
(2) Bob now has all the information to reconstruct p2 to the precision of  using the information he has received.
With p2 known at Bob s end, Alice can proceed to encode in the same fashion p3 with respect to p2, then p4 with respect to p3 and so on until all the points in P are transmitted.
Let ri ( 1 i  n) denote the observed distance between any two successive Cα coordinates pi and pi+1. Let ci ( 1 i  n) denote the cell number on the surface of the sphere of radius ri centered on the point pi in which the point pi+1 falls.
The message length to transmit the entire Cα coordinate data in P is therefore Inull(p1,  ,pn)= O(1)+n 1(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7) I(ri)+I(ci) i=1 bits.
(3) where O(1) denotes the constant number of bits to state p1 (0 bits if Alice translates the coordinates such that p1 lies on the origin). 3.2 Models to describe segments of proteins The secondary structure elements are used as a hypothesis to explain the coordinates.
Here, we consider eight models to describe any contiguous stretch of Cαatoms (of arbitrary length) along the protein chain: (i) a right-handed α-helix (ii) a left-handed i99 [19:58 28/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts223.tex] Page: i99 i97 i105  Copyedited by: MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: A.S.Konagurthu et al. α-helix (iii) a right-handed 310-helix (iv) a left-handed 310-helix (v) a right-handed π-helix (vi) a left-handed π-helix (vii) an extended β-strand and (8) coil.
The Helical (1 6) and strand (7) models follow ideal Pauling Corey geometry (Pauling and Corey, 1951) and are of arbitrary length.
We term these seven collectively ideal models.
(Pauling Corey models are common knowledge and taken to be in the codebook.) The coil model (8) is treated simply as a model that describes a segment of a protein raw, using the null model approach described above in Section 3.1.
3.3 Describing a protein segment using an Ideal model Assume that at some stage of the transmission Bob has received Cα coordinates up to an intermediate point pi, that is he has received coordinates (p1,p2,  ,pi) (i  n). Alice now will transmit a contiguous segment of coordinates pi to pj (1 i  j n) using one of the ideal (helical or strand) models.
If it is a good model, then the coordinates can be transmitted cheaply.
(The discussion of the optimal choice is given in Section 4.) The number of points to be transmitted in this segment is j i since the start point of the segment pi is already known at the receiver s end.
The remaining points pi+1,  ,pj are transmitted as follows: 3.3.1 Transmitting the end point of the segment The end point of the segment (pj) is transmitted using the sphere approach similar to the one described in Section 3.1.
Instead of the distance between successive Cα coordinates, Alice transmits the distance dij between the start (pi) and end (pj) points.
This is encoded using a normal  distribution where the mean (μ) is taken as the distance (d ) between the start and end points from the ideal model containing j i+1 points.
The standard deviation σ of the end point is set to min based on the length of the segment being transmitted and this rule is taken to be a part of the codebook. (cid:6) (cid:7) On the basis of Equation 1, the code length to state dij to the (j i) 0.2Å,3Å (cid:3)(cid:2) I(dij)=log2 accuracy of  is given by (2π)σ    )2 + (dij d 2σ 2 log2 e bits.
(4) (cid:4) On the basis of equation 2, given the start point of the segment pi and distance dij of the end point pj, the end point can lie anywhere on a sphere with radius dij. pj can therefore be stated by specifying the cell number cij on the surface of this sphere in I(cij)=log2(4πd 2 ij ) 2log2  bits.
(5) 3.3.2 Encoding the interior points With the start and end points already known, there are j i 1 interior points of the segment, pi+1,  ,pj 1, yet to be transmitted.
These points can be transmitted cheaply if the chosen ideal model agrees with the observed points in the segment.
Alice uses the following procedure to transmit the interior points given a chosen ideal model.
(Details of how the optimal choice is made appear in Section 4.) Consider an ideal model containing l= j i+1 points, denoted formally as Q= q1,q1,  ,ql. The coordinates in Q are orthogonally transformed to Q(cid:7)= q  such that: ,  ,q (cid:7) 1 (cid:7) ,q 2 (cid:7) l (1) q (cid:7) 1 is same as the start point pi of the segment  (2) the direction cosines of the vector connecting the start and end (cid:7) (cid:7) q points of the ideal model q 1 and the direction cosines of l the vector connecting the start and end points of the observed segment pj pi are the same and (cid:8) 1 k l 2 (3) the sum of the squared error of the (l 2) interior points of the segment with the corresponding interior points of the ideal (cid:7) 1+k model is minimized.
That is, minimized, where.
denotes the Euclidean vector norm.
(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)pi+k q (cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)2 is transformation is related to the more general Such a spatial superposition problem that minimizes the sum of the squared distance between two corresponding vector sets (Kearsley, 1989). However, the transformation is further constrained such that the ﬁrst points of the two sets are the same (Constraint 1) and the rotational axis for the ideal model is the vector between the start (pi) and end (pj) points of the segment (Constraint 2). The ﬁrst two constraints can be achieved using elementary translation and rotation of the ideal coordinates.
Once Q is transformed such that the ﬁrst two constraints are realized, the best rotation θ of Q about the pj pi axis has to be found so that Constraint 3 is realized.
With an approach similar to the generalized superposition problem between two vector sets (Kearsley, 1989), this minimization problem can be solved analytically as an eigenvalue decomposition of a 2 2 square symmetric matrix in quaternion parameters of the corresponding points.
(The detailed proof of the analytical method is too long for the main text and hence is provided as Supplementary Material.) Once the transformation of Q to Q(cid:7) above, Alice can transmit pi+1,  ,pj 1 by: (1) transmitting the best rotation about the pj pi axis of the ideal model.
(Note, Bob has already received the start and end points, pi and pj.) is achieved as described the interior points of the segment, (2) transmitting the interior points pi+1  pj 1 as spatial deviations from their corresponding transformed interior points of the ideal model.
(Bob already knows pi and the coordinates of Q of the ideal model from the codebook. After he receives the end point of the segment pj (using the sphere approach described above), the ideal coordinates can be transformed such that Constraints 1 and 2 of the transformation discussed above are realized.
After Bob receives the rotation θ , the ideal coordinates are rotated by that angle around the axis pj pi whose information he already has.
Once Alice sends the spatial deviations of interior points pi+1,  ,pj 1 with respect to the transformed ideal coordinates, Bob can reconstruct the observed interior points of the segment.) 3.3.3 Transmitting the rotation Rotation θ is transmitted using a uniform distribution over a circle whose radius rθ is the farthest distance of an interior point of the ideal model from the axis of rotation.
Note that rθ need not be transmitted because it is a property of the coordinates of the ideal model which the receiver already knows as a part of the codebook. The rotation is transmitted by dividing the circumference of a circle of radius rθ into arc segments of length  and stating the i100 [19:58 28/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts223.tex] Page: i100 i97 i105  Copyedited by: MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: MML inference of protein secondary structure segment number in which the rotated coordinate with the farthest radius to the axis falls.
Thus, the code length of stating θ  is (cid:10) (cid:11) I(θ  )= log2   2πrθ  =log2(2πrθ ) log2  bits.
(6) 3.3.4 Transmitting the interior points as spatial deviations Let any error vector of an interior point of the segment with to the corresponding transformed interior point of the respect ,1 k l 2 have the vector (cid:12) (cid:13) pi+k q ideal model, ek  components ( xk , yk , zk ). (cid:7) 1+k 2 (7) (cid:13) Each x, y and z of an interior point is transmitted using a normal distribution with a μ of 0 and a standard deviation σ set to the sample standard deviation computed from these error components.
Wallace (2005) gives the MML estimate of code length to transmit a set of independent data ( x1, y1, z1), ( x2, y2, z2),   ( xl 2, yl 2, zl 1) using a normal distribution as: (M 1)log2 σ 2+ M 1 I( x s, y s, z s)= 1 (cid:10) (cid:11) (cid:12) 2 + M (cid:7)+1+log2 κ1 bits.
2 +log2 where M =3 (l 2) is the total number of components of the error vectors ek being transmitted, Rσ gives the prior knowledge of the limits to log2 σ and κ1 1/12 denotes the constant corresponding to + 1 2 quantizing lattices proposed by Conway and Sloane (1984). In this study, we assume that σ is bounded by 3Å because this is consistent with the limits of utility of root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) in superposition as a measure to estimate protein structural similarity.
Therefore, combining code lengths from equations 4 7, the code length required to transmit coordinates of a segment of a protein using any ideal model is give by 2π 2 2N 2 log2 log2 (cid:6) Rσ Iideal(pi,  ,pj)=I(dij)+I(cij)+I(θ  ) +I( x s, y s, z s) bits.
(8) 3.4 Describing a protein segment using the coil model When transmitting a segment of a protein pi,  ,pj as a coil, the coordinates are stated raw in that range using a null model (Section 3.1). Therefore, the code length of stating a segment pi,  pj as a coil is Icoil(pi,  ,pj)= j 1(cid:5) (cid:6) k=i (cid:7) I(rk )+I(ck ) where I(rk ) and I(ck ) are code lengths given in equations 1 and 2.
3.5 Describing the protein as a collection of segments Having laid the foundations of encoding segments of a protein using one of the ideal models or the coil model (Sections 3.3 and 3.4), this section deals with describing the entire protein coordinates as a collection of segments of a model type.
The main idea here is to ﬁnd the best decomposition of points P of a protein into segments where each segment is described using exactly one of eight potential models.
Note that the decomposition, with the associated model descriptors, gives a secondary structural hypothesis of a protein.

Each successive pair of points in P(cid:7) , 2 (cid:7) (cid:7) m 1 , deﬁnes the start and end points of a segment.

A secondary structural assignment of P is given by the (cid:7) (cid:7) segmentation p ,  ,p m and its corresponding model assignment t1,  ,tm 1.

Since each segment of (cid:12) 8 (cid:6) any segmentation can be assigned to any of the eight possible model types, the total possible secondary structural assignments is given by the formula:. For an average protein, this gives a massive search space.
(An efﬁcient dynamic programming method to ﬁnd the best secondary structural assignment is detailed in Section 4.) Any given segmentation P(cid:7) of P and its associated model types acts as a secondary structural hypothesis of the given coordinate data.
Alice can describe and transmit the coordinates in P using this hypothesis over a two-part message.

This part of the message will be composed of the following: (1) the number of segments (m 1) in P(cid:7) and (cid:7) 1 (2) for each segment p (cid:7) k (1 k m 1), communicate (a) the length of the segment lk = ik+1 ik +1 and (b) the model type tk to encode the points in that segment.
The number of segments (m 1) is an integer transmitted using  a log distribution assuming a universal prior on the distribution of numbers.
Rissanen (1983) gives the code length of transmitting any integer n 0 as  (n)=log  2(n)+log2(2.865) Ilog (10)  2(n)=log2 n+log2log2 n+  (over all +ve terms). Next, the lengths of the segments are positive integers.
Although these integers can also be transmitted using a log distribution, it is rather inefﬁcient because in practice the lengths of helices, strands and coils are constrained.
Therefore, in this work, we, encode the lengths of the segments using a Poisson distribution with a predeﬁned mean of λ for each model type: (The parameters λ for each of the eight types of models are treated to be a part of the codebook. In this work we empirically set λ=4 for coil and λ=5 for strands.

The code length to state any integer n 0 using this distribution is: Ipoisson(n) = log2(f (x= n λ)) = λlog2 e nlog2 λ+log2 n! bits (11) Finally, each model type t (encoded as an integer 0 t 7) of any segment is stated using a uniform distribution (uniform is the simplest choice.

Using the notations in Section 3.5, the hypothesis received in the ﬁrst part of the message is of the form , with each segment of some length lk and type tk. The message length to transmit the coordinates given the above segmentation is: (cid:7) k+1 (cid:7) p k ,p (cid:16) (cid:17) Isecond(P P(cid:7) Imodel(p (cid:7) k ,  ,p (cid:7) k+1) bits (14) )= O(1)+m 1(cid:5) k=1 is (Section 3.1), the constant number of bits where O(1) to state the (cid:7) (cid:7) k+1)= ,  ,p ﬁrst Cα coordinate p1 Imodel(p (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:7) ,  ,p ,  ,p k+1) if 0 tk 6 and Imodel= Icoil(p k k+1) if Iideal(p tk =7. k k The total message length of communicating P with P(cid:7) from combining equations 13 and 14 comes Itotal(P&P(cid:7) )= Iﬁrst(P(cid:7) )+Isecond(P P(cid:7) ) (15) 3.6 Problem Statement From the earlier section, the problem of inferring the best secondary structural assignment can now be stated formally as follows: given P containing n points, ﬁnd the secondary structural segmentation P(cid:7) and its corresponding model assignment such that the total message length to transmit P losslessly, Itotal(P&P(cid:7) )+ Isecond(P P(cid:7) )= Iﬁrst(P(cid:7) ) is minimized.
4 INFERENCE OF SECONDARY STRUCTURE This section describes the search method to ﬁnd the best MML secondary structural segmentation from given coordinate data.
i102 4.1 Constructing the code length matrices Equation 15 gives the total message length of communicating coordinates in P using a segmentation P(cid:7) )+Isecond(P P(cid:7) Itotal(P&P(cid:7) (m 1)+m 1(cid:5) ) )= Iﬁrst(P(cid:7) = Ilog Ipoisson(lk )+Iuniform(tk ) (cid:7) + Imodel(p k+1) ,  ,p (cid:10) (cid:11) (cid:7) k : k=1 For a given protein, any pair of points can potentially be the start and end points of a segment.
At the same time, a segment can be described using any of the eight models considered here.
Therefore, the procedure to assign secondary structure to Cα coordinates p1,  ,pn in a given protein begins by constructing a set of eight code length matrices, one for each model type t (0 t 7): H t(i,j)= Ipoisson(j i)+Iuniform(t)+Imodel(pi,  ,pj) (16) where any cell (i,j)1 i j n of the matrix for type t gives the code length of stating the segment pi to pj using the model t. 4.2 Finding the best secondary structural assigning The segmentation of P using various model types enforces a strict ordering constraint, satisfying the requirements for a solution by dynamic programming, even though the search space is huge as discussed in Section 3.5.
Let any D(i) store the optimal message length of transmitting points p1,  ,pi, for all 1 i n. With the boundary condition of D(1)=0, the dynamic programming recurrence to ﬁnd the optimal assignment is given by    min H t(1,j) D(i)+min t t H t(i,j) D(j) = j 1 min i=1 1  j n The above recurrence is used to ﬁll the array D iteratively from 1 to n. On completion, the best secondary structure assignment can be derived by remembering the index i and type t from which the optimal D(j) is computed.
5 POST-PROCESSING In the post-processing step, the above-deﬁned successive segments of same type (helical or strand) from the MML inference are examined for moderate curvature.
Further, sharp turns are identiﬁed and distinguished from coil assignments.
Finally, β-sheets are identiﬁed by grouping together the assigned strands.
Checking for moderate curvature in helix and strand: The MML inference automatically gives the best (in the information theoretic sense) piecewise approximation of a curved helix or strand.
In a single pass through the secondary structural assignment generated by our method, we check for such curvatures and merge successive segments to form a larger segment.
Each helix (1 t 6) and strand (t=7) is represented by a vector.
For a helical segment, the vector is the axis of the helix.
For the strand segment, the vector is the least-square line ﬁtting its Cα atoms.
Two successive segments (of the same model type) are joined to form a  single segment if the orientation angle of their vectors is within 30.
[For a detailed description of the ﬁnding the axes and orientation angle, see Konagurthu et al. (2008)] Identifying sharp turns: sharp turns often have geometries that are conformationally similar to a turn of ideal helical models considered [19:58 28/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts223.tex] Page: i102 i97 i105  Copyedited by: MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: in this work.
Any assignment of a helical segment of length less than or equal to four residues that is preceded and succeeded by other assigned segments is relabeled as a sharp turn.
relative to its neighbouring segments.
However, α-helices often fray or tighten at their N- or C-terminal ends giving a short stretch of π or 310 helical segment.
In order not to incorrectly assign these ends as sharp turns, the orientation of a candidate segment is checked against the preceding and succeeding segments and only assigned a sharp turn if the segment s orientation exceeds 45 Grouping strands forming β-sheet: all strand segments are extracted from a given assignment.
A strand adjacency matrix is computed if and only if where two strands are treated to be adjacent  they are in parallel (with orientation angle in the range 45 )  or anti-parallel (with orientation angle in the range [135 to 180 ]) orientation and there exist Van der Waals interactions between at least two pairs of atoms from the segment. ] or [ 135 to 180      Strands from a β-sheet are then identiﬁed and grouped using a complete depth-ﬁrst search on the strand adjacency matrix.
6 RESULTS Implementation: a program (SST) implementing the method described in the previous section has been developed in C++ programming language.
The program accepts protein coordinates in the Brookhaven PDB format and outputs the secondary structure assignment both at a segment level (stating the start and end point of each secondary structural segment) as well as at a residue level.
The program also generates a PyMol script, which allows users to visualize the secondary stucture assignment.
(Fig. 1). Datasets and comparison methods: To study the performance of SST, we consider a dataset of 1737 PDB structures.
These structures are the same as the dataset considered by Martin et al. (2005), excluding the structures which have been deprecated or those structures that failed running on any one of the considered methods.
(See below.) These structures are divided into four datasets: high- resolution (HRes) dataset with 631 crystal structures solved to 1.7 Å or better medium resolution (MRes) dataset with 582 crystal structures with resolution between 1.7 and 3 Å resolution low- resolution (LRes) dataset with 306 structures with resolution 3 Å and ﬁnally, a dataset of 218 NMR structures.
for In this work, we mainly compare SST with DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) and STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995) exhaustively on the large structural dataset described earlier.
Although there are other programs secondary structure assignment, we had difﬁculty ﬁnding distributions that we could download.
For those we managed to download, we could not install the programs due to unresolvable dependencies in their source code.
However, we use a web server 2Struct (Klose et al., 2010), which allows manual submission of queries with a single point of access to a variety of secondary structure assignment methods beyond DSSP and STRIDE such as KAKSI (Martin et al., 2005), PALSSE (Majumdar et al., 2005), STICK (Taylor, 2001), XtlSStr (King and Johnson, 1999) and P-SEA (Labesse et al., 1997). To facilitate comparisons with other methods, we randomly selected 30 low-resolution structures from the LRes dataset and manually collected the secondary structure assignments from the server.
The list of structures used in this experiment can be download from http:// www.csse.monash.edu.au/ karun/sst. MML inference of protein secondary structure Table 1.
Performance of SST compared with DSSP and STRIDE on four datasets: HRes, MRes, LRes and NMR HRes (% Agreement) Helix Strand MRes (% Agreement) Total Strand Total Helix SST versus DSSP SST versus STRIDE STRIDE versus DSSP 97.6 97.1 99.4 81.9 80.8 98.5 84.1 84.3 96.7 97.6 97.2 99.4 83.4 82.3 98.9 83.9 84.3 96.9 LRes (% Agreement) Helix Strand NMR (% Agreement) Total Strand Total Helix SST versus DSSP SST versus STRIDE STRIDE versus DSSP 97.7 97.2 99.3 84.3 82.3 98.3 82.7 83.8 96.0 98.4 94.4 99.6 53.8 78.9 64.6 51.5 83.9 68.7 Columns labelled Helix and Strand give the percentage agreement of residues assigned as helix and strand, respectively, between the two methods.
Column Total gives the percentage agreement over three classes: helix, strand and others.
Comparison: we ﬁrst assess the composition of the assigned regular secondary structures (helices and strands) using DSSP, STRIDE and SST over the four datasets described earlier.
Overall DSSP assigns 34.5% of residues to helices and 19.9% of residues to strands.
STRIDE assigns 37.3 and 27.4%, and SST assigns 40.4 and 25.3% of residues to helices and strands, respectively.
In general, DSSP is conservative in assigning regular secondary structures resulting in shorter elements compared with output from STRIDE and SST. Examining the lengths of various secondary structural segments, we observe that the average length of a helix and strand segment assigned by SST is 12.1 and 6.1 residues, respectively.
Unlike SST, which states the residue start and end points of each segment, computing the lengths of secondary structural elements from DSSP and STRIDE s output is problematic and error-prone (Majumdar et al., 2005). Table 1 shows the comparison between SST, DSSP and STRIDE over high, medium, low resolution and NMR structures.
To undertake this comparison, the assignments of the three programs are grouped into three classes: helix (of all types), strand and other.
DSSP and STRIDE use similar methods for assignment based on detecting hydrogen bonds.
Therefore, as one would expect, their assignments are highly similar.
SST largely agrees with DSSP and STRIDE when assigning helices.
Strands, however, show some disagreement.
Visually examining several instances, we ﬁnd that in many cases SST assigns longer strands than the other two methods.
Agreement between strand assignments on NMR structures among the three methods is rather poor.
Surprisingly, even DSSP and STRIDE differ enormously in this class even though their assignment methods are quite similar.
Table 2 extends the comparison of SST with other popular methods for assignment on low-resolution structures.
The table shows the percentage agreement of secondary structural assignments between the methods.
Consistent with previous comparative studies (Colloc h et al., 1993 Martin et al., 2005), we see considerable differences in the assignments.
In the absence of a universally acknowledged gold standard for assignment, it becomes very difﬁcult (if not impossible) to objectively validate one method to be truly better than the other.
The observed differences mainly arise from the different criteria used by the methods.
However, i103 [19:58 28/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts223.tex] Page: i103 i97 i105  Copyedited by: MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: A.S.Konagurthu et al. Table 2.

The agreement is measured over all three classes: helix, strand and other.
Fig.2.
Residue-level secondary structure assignment of a 1.75 Å ﬂavodoxin structure from Clostridium beijerinckii. SST residue-level assignment and the segment boundaries are shown in addition to the assignments across multiple methods.
For details of the secondary structure codes, see http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/ karun/sst/codes.html manually examining many cases where the methods differ, we ﬁnd that most disagreements appear at the ends of various (helical or strand) segments.
We will use a simple example to highlight the most common type of differences.
Figure 2 gives the overall residue- level secondary structure assignment across different methods for a ﬂavodoxin structure from Clostridium beijerinckii (wwPDB ID:5NLL). DSSP and STRIDE assignments are nearly identical to each other.
From the ﬁgure, small disagreements between methods can be seen around the start and end points of various segments demarcated by SSTs segment view (labelled SST(SEG)). A major difference between DSSP and SST is the region Lys28...Asn34, which SST assigns as a strand.
DSSP starts the segment three residues further at Asn31. Inspecting the structure, we ﬁnd a backbone hydrogen bond between Asp29 and Met1. This might suggest the start of the strand at either Asp29 or one residue upstream at Lys28 as identiﬁed by SST. Also, in the region Glu62...Ile73, only SST correctly assigns a π-helical cap (Glu62...Phe66) leading into a α-helix. To evaluate the consistency of SSTs secondary structural assignments on coordinates solved at different resolutions, we randomly selected 15 protein structures for which both the superseded low-resolution coordinates and the new high-resolution coordinates were available.
Table 3 gives the list of considered structures along with the percentage agreement between SSTs assignment at different resolutions.
The results indicate that SST produces consistent results on structures determined at different resolutions.
The 10% differences (Table 3, last column) in agreement on the chosen structures may well represent genuine structural differences rather than shortcomings of the algorithm.
Further, to illustrate the reliable segmentation produced by SST on structures with long, curved helices and strands, we chose two structures: Leucine zipper protein (wwPDB: 1NKP) composed of very long helices and Sucrose-speciﬁc porin protein i104 Table 3.

Automatically generated PyMol image of SSTs secondary structural assignment on sucrose-speciﬁc porin (ScrY) from Salmonella typhimurium (wwPDB: 1A0S) information as the coordinates of other atoms are needed to decipher Hydrogen bonds.
KAKSI and XtlSStr are able to process this structure but assign all residues in the chain to coil.
Of the considered methods, only SST, PALSSE and STICK assigned any secondary structure.
For lack of space, the overall residue-level assignment across these three methods are presented in Figure 1 of the supplementary text.
Examining the structure, PALSSE consistently overestimates the regular secondary structural regions by a large margin.
STICK performs well, especially in identifying β-strands. However, it miscalculates several secondary structural elements.
In comparison, SST produced the most reasonable segmentation of the three methods on visual inspection of the structure.
7 CONCLUSION Reliable secondary structure assignment is an important problem.
We have developed a novel information theoretic method to address this problem using the Bayesian framework of MML inference.
Careful examination of the results over a large number of structures suggests that our method gives consistent assignments even on low- resolution data.
We note that our method uses a dictionary of models composed of ideal secondary structural elements.
The details of the models are explicit and open to scrutiny.
It is likely that these models can be improved.
( Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.
