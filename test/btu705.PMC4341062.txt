Associate Editor: Janet Kelso Received on November 29, 2013 revised on September 24, 2014 accepted on October 21, 2014 Abstract Summary: MetMSLine represents a complete collection of functions in the R programming language as an accessible GUI for biomarker discovery in large-scale liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectral datasets from acquisition through to ﬁnal metabolite identiﬁcation forming a backend to output from any peak-picking software such as XCMS. MetMSLine automat- ically creates subdirectories, data tables and relevant ﬁgures at the following steps: (i) signal smoothing, normalization, ﬁltration and noise transformation (PreProc.QC.LSC.R) (ii) PCA and automatic outlier removal (Auto.PCA.R) (iii) automatic regression, biomarker selection, hierarch- ical clustering and cluster ion/artefact identiﬁcation (Auto.MV.Regress.R) (iv) Biomarker MS/MS fragmentation spectra matching and fragment/neutral loss annotation (Auto.MS.MS.match.R) and (v) semi-targeted metabolite identiﬁcation based on a list of theoretical masses obtained from public databases (DBAnnotate.R). Availability and implementation: All source code and suggested parameters are available in an un-encapsulated layout on http://wmbedmands.github.io/MetMSLine/. Readme ﬁles and a syn- thetic dataset of both X-variables (simulated LC MS data), Y-variables (simulated continuous vari- ables) and metabolite theoretical masses are also available on our GitHub repository.

Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC hrMS) instrumentation is being more routinely used for data- acquisition for metabolomic analyses in large-scale studies (e.g. 300 samples). Raw data need to be processed via computational tools to extract relevant information and meaningful biological conclusions.
Processing of LC hrMS raw data is currently facilitated by softwares such as XCMS, MzMine, MetaboAnalyst and Maven (Smith et al. 2006 Pluskal et al. 2010 Clasquin et al. 2012  Xia et al. 2012). However, an automated software pipeline with minimal manual interaction for efficient, reproducible and objective large-scale metabolomic data analysis is also desirable.
Software tools can systematically perform all downstream aspects of metabo- lomic analysis following peak-picking.
Development of such a work- flow in the R language can offer several advantages such as availability of modular packages for functional programming and graphics and the ease of accessibility of a GUI for non-specialists.
We have developed novel software, MetMSLine, coded in the R language which automates the process of untargeted metabolomic data analyses of large datasets from acquisition of data from LC hrMS platforms through to unknown biomarker identification.

Use of the software via GUI requires a clear understanding of data processing steps in metabolomics. 2.1 Step 1: Pre-processing of raw data matrix from XCMS Large LC hrMS metabolomics datasets contain unwanted variation introduced by MS signal drift/attenuation and multiplicative noise across the dynamic range.
These effects can detrimentally impact biomarker discovery and MS features require rigorous quality assur- ance. PreProc.QC.LSC first zero-fills data, then if sample normal- ization is required the median fold change method can also be applied (Veselkov et al. 2011). PreProc.QC.LSC then uses the QC- based locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing method to alleviate the effects of signal drift (Dunn et al. 2011). The degree of smooth- ing is controlled by the smoother span value (e.g. f¼ 1/5), this argu- ment sets the proportion of points used to smooth at each point.
Data are then Log-transformed and finally features analytically sta- ble across the regularly injected (every 5 10 true sample) pooled QCs are retained (e.g. RSD¼ 30, i.e. 30% relative standard deviation). 2.2 Step 2: Removal of outliers The next function performs automated removal of outliers in the pre-processed data based on expansion of the Hotellings T2 distri- bution ellipse.
The argument out.tol (outlier tolerance) controls the proportional expansion of the ellipse (e.g. 1.1 or a 10% propor- tional expansion). Any samples within the first and second compo- nent PCA score plot beyond this expanded ellipse are removed and the PCA model recalculated.
Assuming outliers are detected Auto.PCA performs two rounds of outlier removal and saves details of outliers removed along with corresponding samples from the Y-variable data table supplied in the parent directory in.csv format.

Data acquisition and MetMSLine data processing workﬂow (Steps 1 4). Sample preparation (e.g. urine dilution) is followed by untargeted MS and MS/MS data acquisition in sequence and peak picking softwares MetMSLine then performs sequentially: signal drift correction and pre-pro- cessing (Step 1), automatic PCA-based outlier removal (sam- ples¼ black, QCs¼ red, outliers¼ green), automatic iterative regression based on continuous Y-variables supplied and cluster ion identiﬁcation (Step 3) and ﬁnal identiﬁcation by data-dependent MS/MS and database matching (Step 4) (Step 2) 789 2.3 Step 3: Multivariate regression Auto.MV.Regress utilizes continuous Y-variables to regress to the pre-processed MS dataset. Auto.MV.Regress creates a subfolder for each Y-variable supplied, then identifies potential biomarkers based on a user-defined correlation threshold (e.g. Corr.thresh¼ 0.3) and below a multiple testing corrected P-value (P¼ 0.01) and both scat- terplots and box and whisker plots are generated.
Potential bio- markers above the threshold are hierarchically clustered and X Y and X X heatmaps generated.
Inter-feature clustering (X X) is used to identify cluster ions from a list of 88 isotope, adduct, frag- ment and co-metabolite mass shifts.
2.4 Step 4 (i): MS/MS matching for biomarker structure elucidation As an LC hrMS platform can acquire MS/MS data with precise masses, we coded a function to use the MS/MS data for the identifi- cation of metabolites.
This function matches potential biomarkers identified by Auto.MV.Regress to MS/MS fragmentation spectra by a retention time window (ret¼ 10 s) and mass tolerance (Frag.ppm¼ 20). Auto.MS.MS.match calculates the precursor (in blue on plot) to fragment (in red on plot) and inter-fragment mass differences, and labels where available the neutral losses/fragments commonly encountered in MS/MS spectra.
2.5 Step 4 (ii): Compound annotation using exact mass matching The final function utilizes targeted lists of experiment-specific antici- pated metabolites (in.csv format) provided by the user to annotate the unknown biomarkers. DBAnnotate optionally calculates from the targeted lists of anticipated metabolites, expected m/z of both typical phase II conjugates and electrospray adducts. DBAnnotate matches against all iterations of these potential theoretical masses below user-defined mass tolerances (MassAcc¼ 10 ppm) and returns an aggregated result table.
3 Conclusion MetMSLine presents a complete data processing method it is easy to use as a GUI and should be very beneficial to researchers to rap- idly process large-scale LC hrMS dataset. It potentially requires minimal manual interaction with the software, when compared with the high-manual interaction required by commonly used softwares for LC hrMS datasets such as MetaboAnalyst, MAVEN, apLCMS, MzMine and IDEOM (Yu et al. 2009 Pluskal et al. 2010 Clasquin et al. 2012 Creek et al. 2012 Xia et al. 2012). The rapidity of the process allows great scope for parameter optimization and the sub- sequent ability to dedicate more time to result interpretation.
