In a typical shotgun proteomics experiment, it is assumed that all proteins are equally likely to be present.
However, there is often other information available, e.g. the probability of a protein s presence is likely to correlate with its mRNA concentration.
Results: We develop a Bayesian score that estimates the pos- terior probability of a protein s presence in the sample given its identiﬁcation in an MS/MS experiment and its mRNA concentration measured under similar experimental conditions.
Our method, MSpresso, substantially increases the number of proteins identiﬁed in an MS/MS experiment at the same error rate, e.g. in yeast, MSpresso increases the number of proteins identiﬁed by 40%. We apply MSpresso to data from different MS/MS instruments, experimental conditions and organisms (Escherichia coli, human), and predict 19 63% more proteins across the different datasets. MSpresso demonstrates that incorporating prior knowledge of protein presence into shotgun proteomics experiments can substantially improve protein identiﬁcation scores.

methods of high-throughput protein identiﬁcation like western blotting, 2D gel electrophoresis and green-ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) fusion tagging are very expensive in labor, time and resources.
Mass spectrometry (MS) based shotgun proteomics is a simple alternative to these methods.
With sensitive tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) instruments or extensive biochemical fractionation, several thousand proteins can be identiﬁed (Brunner et al., 2007 Graumann et al., 2007 Peng et al., 2003 Washburn et al., 2001). However, less costly approaches only identify a few hundred proteins in a complex protein sample.
A shotgun proteomics experiment typically proceeds by MS/MS analysis of peptides from proteolytically digested proteins, followed by in silico matching of the MS/MS spectra against a database of theoretical peptide spectra derived from protein sequences (Fig. 1). Proteins are identiﬁed from combined evidence for their composite peptides, resulting in a list in which each protein is associated with a conﬁdence score of correct identiﬁcation. We refer to this score as the original , primary or raw protein identiﬁcation score, e.g. here using ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). All proteins with scores greater than a chosen threshold are labeled present (Fig. 1). Protein identiﬁcation in an MS/MS experiment is hindered by a number of factors: noisy spectra, low-concentration proteins, post- translational modiﬁcations and chemical properties that interfere with efﬁcient peptide ionization.
For complex samples such as cell lysates, current MS search algorithms typically match a disproportionately small percentage ( 20%) of all MS/MS spectra to peptides in a database, and only a small fraction of the expected proteins is identiﬁed. In other words, despite their presence in the biological sample, raw MS/MS identiﬁcation scores of many proteins fall below a given conﬁdence threshold and the proteins are incorrectly labeled as not present.
The vast majority of MS/MS experiments are analyzed without considering any prior information regarding a protein s presence in the sample.
MS/MS protein identiﬁcation scoring schemes, e.g. BioWorks (ThermoFinnigan) or ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003), assume that all proteins are equally likely to be present.

Boosting protein identiﬁcations with prior information on mRNA concentration.
A complex protein sample, e.g. cellular extract, is enzy- matically digested into peptides and subjected to MS/MS. Raw MS/MS spectra are searched against a database of sequences using primary protein identiﬁcation software, e.g. Bioworks (ThermoFinnigan), PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002) and ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003), which produces a list of proteins and scores that signify the probability of correct identiﬁcation. In a secondary analysis, MSpresso reexamines protein identiﬁcation scores with respect to their mRNA abundance.
MSpresso boosts the protein identiﬁcation score given sufﬁcient mRNA concentration.
Proteins are then labeled present if their MSpresso probability is larger than a newly determined cutoff.
The MSpresso score, P(K = 1 S, M), estimates the probability of protein presence as the posterior probability of K = 1 given mRNA abundance M and MS protein identiﬁcation score S. MSpresso uses three probabilities, P(K S), P(K) and P(K M), and their estimation is discussed in the text.
K, protein presence S, MS/MS identiﬁcation score M, mRNA concentration.
inﬂuence the inferred probability of protein presence when evidence from the MS/MS experiment is weak.
Our method, MSpresso (for MS and exPRESSion data), integrates data from MS/MS experiments with mRNA expression data in a Bayesian framework.
MSpresso computes a new protein iden- tiﬁcation score as the posterior probability of the protein being present in the sample given both its MS/MS and mRNA scores.
We demonstrate the applicability of MSpresso on a yeast sample grown in rich medium analyzed on a low-resolution mass spectrometer (LCQ). We use mRNA concentrations from three independent experiments (Holstege et al., 1998 Velculescu et al., 1995 Wang et al., 2002) and corresponding protein data from four MS experiments (Chi et al., 2007 de Godoy et al., 2006 Peng et al., 2003 Washburn et al., 2001). We compare the performance of MSpresso on the yeast sample with the original raw MS/MS identiﬁcation scores using ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) plots, and ﬁnd an increase of 40% in the number of proteins identiﬁed at a ﬁxed error rate.
We validate 98% of these new identiﬁcations by their presence in at least one of the seven independent benchmarking datasets. We also generalize the method and demonstrate its applicability to a data from a high-resolution MS/MS instrument, different biological conditions, as well as to other organisms (Escherichia coli, human). To the best of our knowledge, MSpresso is the ﬁrst integrative approach to analysis of shotgun proteomics data.
2 METHODS 2.1 MSpresso uses a Bayesian probability framework Primary protein identiﬁcation is an essential step in the procedure to derive an initial list of proteins and their MS/MS identiﬁcation scores.
The process is 1398 outlined in Figure 1.
Starting from the MS/MS analysis of a complex protein sample, we used Bioworks (ThermoFinnigan), PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002) and ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003) to derive an initial list of proteins and their corresponding protein identiﬁcation scores.
We do not require that the raw MS/MS identiﬁcation score be a probability, though this is the case with ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). Any other MS analysis software is equally suitable for primary protein identiﬁcation. MSpresso also does not affect peptide identiﬁcations as it only uses identiﬁcations at the protein level.
MSpresso results do not reﬂect on the quality of the primary protein identiﬁcation, they merely produce a new score based on additional information.
The MSpresso protein identiﬁcation probability combines both direct and inferential evidence of protein presence.
Direct evidence is generated by methods that directly measure protein presence e.g. MS/MS analysis.
Inferential evidence refers to data that implies protein presence but does not directly measure it, e.g. mRNA abundance.
More formally, K is a Bernoulli variable where K = 1 is the event that the protein is present in the sample, and P(K = 1) is the probability of that event.
The MSpresso probability is the posterior probability P(K S = s, M = m) that a protein is present in the sample given its associated mRNA abundance M = m, and its raw MS/MS protein identiﬁcation score S = s. Using Bayes law, (cid:2) P P (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) P (cid:2) (cid:3) M K S K K S,M (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) K P (cid:3) (cid:2) K S  P P P S (cid:3)(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) P K (cid:2)  1 K S K P (cid:3) (cid:2) K M P (cid:3) P K K M (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) K P P P P P S M M (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3) (1) Using a conditional independence assumption between M and S given K, we set P(M K, S) = P(M K). In other words, we assume that observed mRNA abundance M is independent of S given that the protein is present (see Supplementary Material for discussion and detailed derivation). P(K M) and P(K S) are the posterior probabilities of a protein existing in the sample, given only its mRNA abundance M and primary identiﬁcation score S, respectively.
P(K) is the prior probability of the protein being present.
Rewriting and normalizing, we obtain the MSpresso score: (cid:2) K S,M P (cid:3)= P (cid:6) K=0,1 (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) P K S (cid:2) K S P (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) /P K M (cid:2) K M P (cid:3) K /P (cid:3) (cid:2) K (cid:3) (2) 2.2 Evaluation methodology To compare primary and MSpresso protein identiﬁcations, we estimated true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR) and precision, given the proteins known to be in the sample (positive instances) and known not to be in the sample (negative instances). TPR at score threshold t is the fraction of positive instances with scores  t. FPR at score threshold t is the fraction of negative instances with scores  t. False negative rate at score t is the fraction of all positive instances with score  t, and is equal to (1  TPR). Precision at score threshold t is the fraction of all identiﬁcations with scores  t that are positive instances.
Note that FPRs are computed differently from false discovery rates (FDR = 1  precision) (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003), and the number of reported proteins can vary depending on the error model.
Supplementary Section 2.5 has a discussion on different error estimates.
We evaluated results using protein reference datasets of large-scale protein identiﬁcation. Reference sets act as an empirical estimate of the ground truth of proteins truly present in the sample.
Proteins present in the reference set were labeled as positive instances.
The reference sets were used as training data to estimate the probabilities in Equation (2), and in evaluation to validate the reported proteins and generate ROC plots.
Since we typically used the same set for training and evaluation, probability estimates were averaged across 10 runs of 10-fold cross-validation, using a different fold partitioning per run.
We constructed protein reference sets by gathering high- conﬁdence protein identiﬁcations from published large-scale experiments [11:43 14/5/2009 Bioinformatics-btp168.tex] Page: 1398 1397 1403  run on similar sample conditions.
When such data was unavailable, we generated a reference set by pooling high-conﬁdence protein identiﬁcations from several technical replicates of our MS/MS experiment e.g. human data (Section 2.3.4). Reference sets for each experiment are given in Section 2.3.
In Section 3.4.2, we discuss evaluation without protein reference sets, where we used decoy proteins to represent negative instances.
In each experiment, we generated MSpresso scores for all proteins in the test set of proteins with non-zero primary identiﬁcation score and mRNA abundance.
Since the samples were cytosolic, we expected a bias in sample composition against membrane proteins and therefore excluded all proteins predicted to have one or more membrane helices (Kall et al., 2004). In rich- medium yeast, this resulted in a test set of 4165 genes and 3443 proteins in the mRNA and protein reference datasets, respectively.
All numbers quoted in Section 3 refer to proteins without membrane helices analysis of the full proteome gives similar results (Supplementary Fig.S7C). 2.3 Datasets and sample preparation We applied MSpresso to a variety of organisms, experimental conditions and mass spectrometers: yeast grown in rich and minimal medium, E. coli grown in minimal medium and a human cell line.
We analyzed each dataset on one or two different mass spectrometers: a ThermoFinnigan Surveyer/DecaXP+ (LCQ) or ThermoFinnigan LTQ-OrbiTrap (ORBI). MS/MS protein identiﬁcation was conducted using the Bioworks 3.3.
(ThermoFinnigan), PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002) and ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003) pipeline.
Details for each dataset are given below, with more details in the Supplementary Material (Section 1). 2.3.1 Yeast (rich medium) Cell lysate from wild-type yeast grown in rich medium was analyzed on both the LCQ and ORBI mass spectrometers.
The LCQ data has been published before (Lu et al., 2007). For the fractionation data, cellular lysate was separated in a 7 47% sucrose gradient and fractions were monitored by UV for RNA content.
We chose the fraction containing 80S ribosomes for further liquid chromatography (LC) MS/MS analysis on the LCQ. The mRNA data is the average of at least two of three independent absolute expression measurements, all derived from wild-type yeast grown to log- phase in rich medium (Holstege et al., 1998 Velculescu et al., 1995 Wang et al., 2002). The same dataset was also used in Lu et al. (2007). The protein reference set was generated from a pool of four independent MS-based protein datasets from yeast grown in rich medium (Chi et al., 2007 de Godoy et al., 2006 Peng et al., 2003 Washburn et al., 2001), choosing proteins present in at least two of the four datasets ( YP4gte2 ). Proteins that were absent from all four datasets represent the negative instances, i.e. we assume these proteins are not expressed under the given conditions.
Unless stated otherwise, all rich-medium yeast results in this article use this reference dataset. We also compiled a non-MS-based protein reference dataset (YP3, Supplementary Section 1.2, Fig.S7D). For the fractionation data, we assembled a list of ribosomal proteins as published in literature (Planta and Mager, 1998) and proteins annotated as ribosomal, involved in ribosome biogenesis or translation (Nash et al., 2007). 2.3.2 Yeast (minimal medium) MS/MS data on wild-type yeast grown in minimal medium (MOPS9) was derived from published work (Lu et al., 2007), with cell lysate analyzed on an LCQ mass spectrometer.
The mRNA abundance was obtained from one dataset for yeast grown in minimal medium (YMD) (Smirnova et al., 2005). Protein reference data comprised of published ﬂow-cytometry analysis of GFP-labeled proteins [2214 proteins (Newman et al., 2006), 1792 are non-membrane and have detectable mRNA abundances], combined with two MS-based datasets for a total of 2529 proteins identiﬁed at high conﬁdence (2022 non-membrane and with mRNA abundances). See Supplementary Section 1.2 for details.
Integrative analysis of mRNA and mass spectrometry datasets 2.3.3 Escherichia coli (minimal medium) We performed shotgun MS/MS analysis on trypsinized, soluble proteins extract from E.coli grown in minimal medium using the LTQ-OrbiTrap mass spectrometer [details in Supplementary Material and Lu et al. (2007)]. Three datasets provided information on mRNA concentration (Allen et al., 2003 Corbin et al., 2003 Covert et al., 2004). Reference data comprised of two published 2D-gel electrophoresis datasets (Link et al., 1997 Lopez-Campistrous et al., 2005) for a total of 370 non-membrane proteins that also had detectable mRNA abundances.
2.3.4 Human We analyzed two human datasets generated by MS/MS analysis on two mass spectrometers (LCQ, LTQ-OrbiTrap). Experimental preparation of human data from the Daoy medulloblastoma cell line is described in the Supplementary Section 1.4.
As no matching published large- scale human proteomics dataset was available for use as a reference set, we generated one by combining high-conﬁdence protein identiﬁcations ( 5% FDR deﬁned by ProteinProphet) from 10 technical replicates (injections) of MS/MS analysis on the LTQ-OrbiTrap mass spectrometer.
We used this as a reference set for the LCQ dataset. For the LTQ-OrbiTrap dataset, we pooled nine replicates into a reference set, and used the 10th replicate as the test set.
2.3.5 Functional analysis of reported proteins Functional analysis of yeast proteins was conducted with saccharomyces genome database (SGD) (Nash et al., 2007), FunSpec (Robinson et al., 2002) and FuncAssociate (Berriz et al., 2003), applying Bonferroni corrections for multiple hypothesis testing.
There was no bias towards phosphorylated proteins among MSpresso identiﬁcations (Chi et al., 2007 Ptacek et al., 2005). Functional analysis of E.coli proteins was conducted using annotations from GenProtEC (Serres et al., 2004). 2.3.6 Data availability Yeast LCQ and E.coli data have been published (Lu et al., 2007). Other MS/MS data is available at http://www.marcottelab.org/MSpresso/. 3 RESULTS We ﬁrst present results on a rich-medium yeast sample, followed by results on E.coli and human datasets. We then describe generalizations of the method that apply in the absence of high-quality training data.
Finally, we discuss evaluation without reference sets (decoy databases). 3.1 Knowledge of mRNA levels can improve identiﬁcation of the expressed yeast proteome We show that incorporating prior evidence of protein presence into the protein identiﬁcation score can signiﬁcantly increase the probability of correct protein identiﬁcation in MS/MS experiments.
To compute the MSpresso score in Equation (2), we must estimate three probabilities (Fig. 1): (i) the prior probability P(K = 1) of protein presence in the sample (ii) the posterior probability P(K S) of protein presence given only its primary MS/MS identiﬁcation score S and (iii) the posterior probability P(K M) of protein presence given only its mRNA concentration M. We assume P(K) follows the uniform distribution, and set the probability P(K = 1) = constant for all proteins.
Under this model, P(K) acts as a proportionality constant which does not change the ranking of MSpresso scores, but just their value.
For the expressed yeast proteome, we estimate P(K) = 2/3, as suggested by the size of a reference dataset (Chi et al., 2007 de Godoy et al., 2006 Peng et al., 2003 Washburn et al., 2001). The posterior probability P(K S) is learned using a logistic regression classiﬁer on the primary identiﬁcation score [from 1399 [11:43 14/5/2009 Bioinformatics-btp168.tex] Page: 1399 1397 1403  S.R.Ramakrishnan et al. ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003)]. The posterior probability P(K M) is estimated by binning experimentally determined mRNA concentrations (Holstege et al., 1998 Velculescu et al., 1995 Wang et al., 2002). We used the protein reference set YP4gte2 described in Section 2.3.1 as ground truth for training and evaluation.
We generated a histogram of mRNA abundances (log-scale) and set P(K M) to the fraction of proteins present in the protein reference dataset per bin (Fig. 2). We chose bin width to maximize the area under ROC curve (AUC) using cross-validation.
AUC was not very sensitive to bin size variation (data not shown). In general, we expect proteins with high levels of mRNA expression to have a better chance of being present in a proteomics Fig.2.
Experimental data describes the relationship between the probability of protein presence given that the corresponding mRNA is observed at a certain abundance, P(K M = m). The relationship is modeled by a histogram of the fraction of proteins present in the protein reference set per bin of mRNA concentration, generated from a rank ordered list of mRNA abundances using 225 proteins per mRNA bin.
The protein reference dataset contains four MS- based proteomics datasets (Chi et al., 2007 de Godoy et al., 2006 Peng et al., 2003 Washburn et al., 2001) the mRNA data is an average of three datasets (Holstege et al., 1998 Velculescu et al., 1995 Wang et al., 2002). Table 1.
MSpresso performance in different experiments experiment.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that the probability of protein presence in the reference dataset, P(K = 1 M), increases with increasing mRNA concentration (Fig. 2). Note that the relationship in Figure 2 refers to the relationship between mRNA abundance M and protein presence K, which is different from the relationship between protein abundance and mRNA abundance that has been studied elsewhere (Futcher et al., 1999 Greenbaum et al., 2003 Gygi et al., 1999 Lu et al., 2007). Figure 2 resembles a step function with linear interpolation between steps: below a (log-scale) concentration of 0.5 mRNA molecules/cell the probability of the protein being present in the reference set is low (P(K = 1 M) 0.10), while above nine molecules/cell the probability is high [P(K = 1) 0.90]. The step function is conserved for yeast grown in minimal medium, E. coli and human (Supplementary Fig.S2). 3.2 Results on rich-medium yeast sample 3.2.1 MSpresso identiﬁes up to 63% more proteins than the primary identiﬁcation Using Equation (2), we calculated the MSpresso protein identiﬁcation score for each protein in the rich-medium yeast LCQ dataset. A protein that is present in the YP4gte2 reference set (Section 2.3.1) is labeled as true identiﬁcation (positive instance), and a protein that is absent from it is labeled as a false identiﬁcation (negative instance). We report the MSpresso score for each protein and a 5% FPR cutoff over all identiﬁed proteins.
Table 1 summarizes the results at 5% FPR for yeast and other experiments.
MSpresso identiﬁes more proteins at the same error rate than the primary identiﬁcation. Figure 3A and B illustrate performance via ROC (TPR versus FPR) and precision recall plots (TPR versus precision). The MSpresso ROC curve dominates the primary identiﬁcation curve at a wide range of FPRs. This observation implies that using MSpresso scores is better than just lowering the primary score threshold (choosing a threshold with higher FPR) to obtain more predictions.

The better the MSpresso-based scoring, the higher the Percentage AUC increase and Percentage increase in number of identiﬁed proteins.
These experiments use the self MSpresso model: trained and evaluated on experiment-speciﬁc reference data.
MSpresso results using the reuse model are presented in the Supplementary Material (Table S10). aData as extrapolated from the ROC curve where there was no data at 5% FPR. 1400 [11:43 14/5/2009 Bioinformatics-btp168.tex] Page: 1400 1397 1403  Integrative analysis of mRNA and mass spectrometry datasets sets, nor identiﬁed by the primary identiﬁcation: GTO3, glutathione transferase (Nash et al., 2007) a protein not unusual for cells growing (and dividing) in rich medium, and GCN4, a transcription activator of the amino acid starvation response (Lee et al., 2007). We did not expect GCN4 to be expressed in rich medium, and it is either a false positive or indicates a weak-starvation response.
MSpresso can also negatively inﬂuence protein identiﬁcation, i.e. low-mRNA concentration shifts MSpresso scores below threshold even if the primary identiﬁcation labeled such proteins present.
There were 15 such proteins in the yeast dataset. They were not enriched for any functional category and had low-mRNA concentration [ 0.88 molecules/cell median P(K M) = 0.26] in to the median mRNA concentration across all genes contrast [16 molecules/cell median P(K M) = 0.80]. All but three proteins were as present in the reference sets: two cell cycle proteins (SWE1, SSN3) and a protein of unknown function (MUK1). 3.3 Results on other yeast datasets and other organisms We tested MSpresso for other biological conditions, organisms and mass spectrometers as detailed in Section 2.3.
MSpresso increased the number of identiﬁcations at 5% FPR by 19 63% across all datasets (Table 1), while maintaining constant or higher precision than the primary identiﬁcation (data not shown). MSpresso increased AUC by 3 19% across experiments a substantial increase since AUC is related to the probability of correct classiﬁcation. ROC plots are in the Supplementary Figure S8. rich-medium yeast applied MSpresso to three other yeast 3.3.1 Yeast We datasets: reanalyzed on a high-resolution mass spectrometer LTQ-OrbiTrap (Table 1: Yeast-YPD-ORBI), yeast grown in minimal medium (Table 1: Yeast-YMD-LCQ), and a sample from a sucrose gradient experiment (Table 1: Yeast- Fraction-LCQ). MSpresso-predictions for OrbiTrap and YMD experiments were strongly enriched for metabolic and ribosomal functions (P-value  0.001) (Berriz et al., 2003) proteins of these functions are typically in high concentration in growing and dividing yeast cells.
In addition, MSpresso-predicted proteins from yeast grown in minimal medium are enriched for small molecule metabolism (P-value  0.001), which is expected for growth in minimal medium.
3.3.2 Escherichia coli We applied MSpresso to cytosolic protein extract from E.coli grown in minimal medium analyzed on an LTQ-OrbiTrap (Section 2.3.3 Table 1, Escherichia coli-ORBI). The MSpresso-predicted proteins were enriched for the same functions as proteins from primary analysis: biosynthesis and translation [P-value  0.001 using a background of all 3503 E.coli proteins with function annotation (Serres et al., 2004)]. The reference dataset was very small ( 370 proteins) and hindered immediate veriﬁcation of the newly identiﬁed proteins.
3.3.3 Human We applied MSpresso on two human datasets described in Section 2.3.4 (Table 1: Human-LCQ, Human-ORBI). We found 20% more proteins in both datasets than the primary identiﬁcations, and these proteins were enriched for functions in metabolism, translation and biosynthesis (P-value  0.001) (Berriz et al., 2003). 1401 Fig.3.
Performance of MSpresso in yeast grown in rich medium.
We evaluate the performance of MSpresso, the original MS/MS identiﬁcations (ProteinProphet), and MSpresso using a random P(K M) to determine true and false model using a ground-truth reference set identiﬁcations. (A) ROC plot (TPR versus FPR): MSpresso identiﬁes more true positives at a given FPR than the MS/MS identiﬁcations, and has a 19% higher AUC. (B) Precision recall plot (TPR versus precision): MSpresso increases precision at ﬁxed recall across different score thresholds.
Similarly MSpresso outperforms the primary identiﬁcation in Figure 3B, with higher TPR at the same precision.
The AUC is equal to the probability that the classiﬁer will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (Fawcett, 2006). MSpresso, with AUC = 0.89, provided a 19% increase in AUC compared with the primary MS/MS-based protein identiﬁcation (AUC = 0.75), and a 27% increase compared with MSpresso with random P(K M) (AUC = 0.70) (Fig. 3A, Table 1). At a 3.2.2 Functional analysis of MSpresso identiﬁcations 5% FPR cutoff, MSpresso identiﬁes 40% more proteins than ProteinProphet (Table 1) 327 versus 234.
Of these identiﬁcations, 100 were not identiﬁed by the primary analysis, and are new MSpresso identiﬁcations. These proteins had sub-threshold ProteinProphet scores and were hence labeled not present.
Due to their high-mRNA concentration ( 9 molecules/cell), their scores were increased above threshold and they were marked present.
The 100 newly identiﬁed proteins were not biased in their functions compared with the background: the union of all proteins identiﬁed by ProteinProphet and MSpresso (Berriz et al., 2003). Both ProteinProphet- and MSpresso-predicted proteins were enriched for molecules of high concentration, e.g. ribosomal proteins, proteins of biosynthesis and metabolism (P-value  0.001). We also analyzed the intersection of MSpresso 5% FPR proteins with the reference datasets described in Section 2.3.1. see Supplementary Fig.S7 (P-value  0.001), hypergeometric distribution]. Only two MSpresso-identiﬁed proteins were neither present in the reference two yeast [YP4gte2 and YP3  [11:43 14/5/2009 Bioinformatics-btp168.tex] Page: 1401 1397 1403  S.R.Ramakrishnan et al. 3.4 General applicability of the method So far, we have discussed MSpresso models trained on high-quality protein reference sets available for the respective organism (dubbed the self model). However, the method can be generalized to cases where little or no protein reference data is available.
For example, the P(K M) estimates for E. coli (Supplementary Fig.S2) are much smaller than those in yeast, because the protein reference dataset comprises only 370 proteins.
For this reason, we developed models that reuse P(K M) and P(K S) relationships learned from available datasets, albeit in different sample conditions or organisms.
Our aim was to investigate the degree to which these relationships can be reused across datasets. The reuse model for P(K S) involves applying the P(K S) logistic regression classiﬁer, which was learned on high-quality data (e.g. rich-medium yeast), to other datasets. We now describe reuse models for P(K M) based on the yeast model (or the best organism-speciﬁc model). 3.4.1 Generalizing P(K M) First, we approximated P(K M) estimating by P(K (log10M  0.5)) = 0.10 and P(K (log10M  9)) = 0.90 (results not shown). Next, we derived two scaled models: SCALE-UP scales the P(K M) values in Figure 2 to a [0,1] interval, and SCALE- DOWN scales P(K M) to half of the original values (results not shown). The mRNA concentrations from the rich-medium yeast model were also scaled to a [0,1] interval.
from Figure function simple step 2, a A SCALE-UP reuse model derived from Figure 2 (rich-medium yeast data) resulted in 3 14% AUC increase when applied to the other yeast datasets (Supplementary Table S10). We also derived SCALE-UP models from the P(K M) distributions learned on other organisms (E.coli, human) and applied them to the respective organism s datasets. Selected results are presented in the Supplementary Material (Table S10). In general, we recommend using the self model if a high-quality experiment-speciﬁc protein reference set is available.
When such data is unavailable, we recommend using an organism-speciﬁc SCALE-UP model or using the yeast SCALE-UP model.
So far, we have 3.4.2 Evaluation without a protein reference set used protein reference sets as ground truth to deﬁne true and false identiﬁcations. Though we expect our canonical reference dataset for yeast in rich medium to cover most of the expressed yeast proteins (2/3 of the genome), such large-scale protein datasets are mostly unavailable for other organisms.
Thus we need to deﬁne false identiﬁcations to estimate null score models (Choi and Nesvizhskii, 2008 Choi et al., 2008) and error estimates without a reference set.
There have been recent efforts in standardizing null models for peptide identiﬁcations however, no general consensus has yet been reached at the protein level (Elias and Gygi, 2007 Fitzgibbon et al., 2008 Kall et al., 2008 Kim et al., 2008). In general, a set of null or decoy proteins is appended to the sample organism database ( target ) before the MS/MS search.
Decoy proteins are considered to be negative instances.
Proteins from another organism or shufﬂed/reversed protein sequences have been used as decoys (Kall et al., 2008). To investigate evaluation without using a ground-truth reference set, we applied MSpresso to both real (target) and shufﬂed (decoy) yeast protein sequences, labeling any identiﬁed decoys as false identiﬁcations. We ﬁrst ran the MS/MS analysis on rich-medium yeast, matching experimental spectra against a concatenated 1402 database of real and shufﬂed sequences.
This procedure resulted in protein identiﬁcation scores (S) for both target and decoy proteins, letting us estimate P(K S) as before.
However, P(K M) cannot be estimated for decoy proteins in the same manner as for the targets, since decoys are artiﬁcial proteins and do not have associated mRNA abundances.
Hence, we investigated different random P(K M) distributions for the decoy proteins: e.g. random sampling from the target P(K M) distribution, random sampling from the P(K M) values of target proteins that are absent from the reference set (negative instances) and constant at the minimum of the target P(K M) distribution (Supplementary Section 2.6.2). We measure the increase in AUC and the number of proteins identiﬁed using multiple error measures (FPR, FDR, q-value: see Supplementary Section 2.5). Running MSpresso on yeast with ﬁve shufﬂed decoy databases results in up to 5% AUC increase and up to 14% more identiﬁed proteins at 5% FPR. We also experimented with different shufﬂed database sizes ranging from 0.25 to 20 times the size of the real database (Supplementary Section 2.6.1). Detailed results are presented in Supplementary Section 2.6 and Table S6. 3.5 Conclusions We present a method called MSpresso that improves our ability to identify proteins in large-scale shotgun proteomics experiments.
MSpresso learns the relationship between mRNA concentration and the probability of protein presence in a sample, and then applies this relationship to boost sub-threshold protein identiﬁcations in data from MS/MS experiments.
We assess MSpresso performance with ROC curves over a large range of FPRs, and show a boost of 19% AUC in a yeast sample, as well as 40% increase in protein identiﬁcations at 5% FPR, at the same or higher precision.
We also generalize the method to other experimental conditions, mass spectrometers and organisms, even in the absence of a high-quality training dataset. By integrating mRNA evidence into the MSpresso score, we improve the conﬁdence in our predicted proteins, which leads to more identiﬁcations at similar error rates.
MSpresso is not restricted to particular MS-based methods of primary protein identiﬁcation but could be applied to any large- scale proteomics dataset that contains scores signifying conﬁdence in correct identiﬁcation. Our results have interesting biological implications.
For example, the relationship between mRNA concentration and protein identiﬁcation (Fig. 2) is different from what we would expect given a strong correlation between mRNA concentration and protein abundance [R2 = 0.73 (Lu et al., 2007)]. In general, yeast proteins are very easily identiﬁable in shotgun proteomics experiments if their corresponding mRNA is present at 9 molecules/cell (or higher) on average, and at around 1 molecule/cell mRNA, current high- throughput methods largely fail to detect proteins.
This empirical relationship between mRNA abundance and protein identiﬁcation may be reﬁned with increasing experimental sensitivity.
Further, given that we now have several large-scale datasets available, we can attempt to describe the expressed yeast proteome as comprehensively as is currently possible and answer the simple but fundamental question: How many proteins are expressed in yeast growing in log-phase under nutrient rich conditions.
The union of our two MSpresso-predicted datasets (LCQ, ORBI) and the protein reference datasets comprises 3797 cytosolic proteins expressed in yeast growing in rich medium at log-phase 2364 [11:43 14/5/2009 Bioinformatics-btp168.tex] Page: 1402 1397 1403  Integrative analysis of mRNA and mass spectrometry datasets (62%) of these proteins occur in two or more datasets, and may thus form a core set of reliably identiﬁed proteins.
Given that there are 4962 non-membrane yeast proteins in total, we can estimate upper boundaries of observed transcription and translation products and these estimates are impressively high.
The majority of all yeast genes, 84% (4165) have observed mRNA, and for 70% (3512) we observe both mRNA and protein.
Interestingly, there are 282 genes for which no mRNA but protein is observed: mRNA may exist at only very low levels or is rapidly degraded.
Together, these numbers indicate that even in an unperturbed, comparatively simple unicellular eukaryote, a very large number of proteins are expressed and form a complex cellular machinery.
