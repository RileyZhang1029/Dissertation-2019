Finding a particular peptide sequence of interest in CID MS2 records very often requires manual evaluation of the spectrum, regardless of whether the peptide-associated MS2 scan is identiﬁed by PDS algorithm or not.
We have developed a com- pact cross-platform database-free command-line utility, pepgrep, which helps to ﬁnd an MS2 ﬁnger- print for a selected peptide sequence by pattern-matching of modelled MS2 data using Peptide-to- MS2 scoring algorithm.
pepgrep can incorporate dozens of mass offsets corresponding to a variety of post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) into the algorithm.
Decoy peptide sequences are used with the tested peptide sequence to reduce false-positive results.
The engine is capable of screening an MS2 data ﬁle at a high rate when using a cluster computing environment.
The matched MS2 spectrum can be displayed by using built-in graphical application programming interface (API) or optionally recorded to ﬁle. Using this algorithm, we were able to ﬁnd extra peptide sequences in studied CID spectra that were missed by PDS identiﬁcation. Also we found pepgrep especially useful for examining a CID of small fractions of peptides resulting from, for example, afﬁnity puri- ﬁcation techniques.
The peptide sequences in such samples are less likely to be positively identiﬁed by using routine protein-centric algorithm implemented in PDS.

Production and hosting by Elsevier used in discovery (shotgun) proteomics [1 3] and retains its leading position among other MS-conducted peptide-sequenc- ing methods [4]. This is mainly because of its stable display of fragmentation pattern of y- and b-ions that helps to generate a sequence tag, which, in turn, leads to conﬁdent identiﬁcation of peptide sequences [5,6]. Mascot [7], SEQUEST [8] and TANDEM [9] became the popular software for protein identi- ﬁcation based on MS2-to-Peptide and Peptide-to-Protein scor- ing algorithms.
Protein database search (PDS) method relies entirely on a premise that the computed theoretical data matches to scanned ion mass spectrum and, in reality, this works only for a relatively small (5 25%) portion of the spec- tra acquired during a single LC MS run.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2013.02.001  128 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 127 132 part of acquired MS2 data is believed to contain a signiﬁcant part of the peptide-looking spectra that is usually left undis- covered by PDS. The reason for this is thought to be associ- ated with (i) products of post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs), (ii) missed cleavages, (iii) non-speciﬁc cleavages which may occur during protein breakdown and (iv) proteins whose sequences are not present in the searched database.
Although modern search engines allow users to supply dozens of PTM-related mass offsets for PDS as additional options for ﬁxed and/or variable PTMs, practically this is limited to simple amino acid side additions that may appear, for example, dur- ing oxidation and products of in vitro derivatization reactions.
Input with a larger number of PTMs would be infeasible for standard computing architectures commonly used in research labs, due to elevated computational complexity in the search algorithm.
Also this will lead to an increase in the number of false-positive estimations.
Nevertheless, the above limitations are deemed to be not crucial for routine PDS protein discov- ery, because the majority of proteins will always yield some amount of PTM-free compounds during protein digest, which will be sufﬁcient to satisfy PDS-scoring algorithm for conﬁdent identiﬁcation of a protein.
Finding a particular peptide sequence in CID MS2 could be important for some applications that use a targeted approach like commonly used selected reaction monitoring-MS (SRM- MS) [10], or its deviation, multiple reaction monitoring-MS (MRM-MS) [11], technology.
These may also include the se- lected detection of certain peptide sequences after afﬁnity cap- ture using unique PTMs as ligands. In either case, the successful surveying for the searched sequences will rely en- tirely on the PDS protein-centric scoring algorithm, which can return ambiguous results regardless of whether it is used with protein sequences or just a few peptides as a database.
This may require more meticulous analysis of the tandem spec- tra which is typically associated with manual spectrum inter- pretation. However the large volumes of MS2 datasets produced by modern tandem MS instruments make manual examination very inconvenient and thus an automated data- base-free peptide-centric algorithm for fast matching and view- ing of a sequence pattern in MS2 scans is thought to be beneﬁcial. We found that using the Peptide-to-MS2 modelling algorithm supplemented with the parallel complementary tests for decoy sequences does produce good results for surveying a speciﬁed peptide sequence pattern in CID MS2 spectra.
Here we describe a simple database-free approach, pepgrep, for searching peptide pattern matching in CID MS2 data ﬁles that were obtained from popular types of MS tandem instru- ments. The name pepgrep is assigned by analogy to a popular POSIX utility grep.
The matched MS2 spectra can be dis- played using graphical API or saved to a ﬁle for further visual examination, along with the matched MS2 scan data that can be copied to a separate ﬁle. Optionally, it can include a number of mass offsets for amino acid residues related to speciﬁc PTMs. Results The ability of Peptide-to-MS2 algorithm to score identically to PDS algorithm for the same MS2 pattern was estimated by comparing the results produced by both popular search en- gines Mascot and TANDEM with those by pepgrep. For this purpose, we created a diagnostic MS2 dataset a subset of the spectra was selected based on high conﬁdence scoring by both TANDEM and Mascot search engines and expert-con- ducted visual quality estimation.
MS2 data were generated by the Q-TOF instrument ( Premier , Waters) with routine LC MS run with a tryptic protein digestion.
The representa- tive subset was subsequently analysed with pepgrep and found that all PDS-selected MS2 ions were also among the high- scored peptide patterns matched by pepgrep (data not shown). This suggests that Peptide-to-MS2 algorithm is cross-compat- ible with PDS and can be implemented for peaking up and visualizing a single peptide pattern match among MS2 spectra during iteration of the dataset. In another instance, we used a combination of TANDEM and pepgrep to analyse the products of co-immunoprecipita- tion (co-IP) reaction of mammalian cell proteins.
The enriched co-IP protein band of interest was extracted from a Coomassie stained gel and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion.
The CID MS2 spectra were obtained by using an ion-trap instrument (Esquire, Bruker) during standard LC MS run.
MS2 identiﬁ- cation with TANDEM revealed a number of proteins.
Among them, one was of particular interest, which is ATP-dependent RNA helicase A (Swiss-Prot accession No.Q08211). Using in silico digestion, we generated all tryptic peptides for this pro- tein with the number of missed cleavages equal to two and a set of expected PTMs allowed into the search.
Analysis with pepgrep displayed the presence of MS2 spectra matching a sig- niﬁcantly larger number of peptides than those identiﬁed dur- ing TANDEM search (Table 1, see detailed spectra in supplementary Figure S1). All of the peptide-associated MS2 patterns resembled a good proﬁle for both y- and b- ions esti- mated by visual examination.
Finally, we evaluated pepgrep in ﬁnding expected sequence patterns in MS2 scans generated by ion trap LC MS analysis of afﬁnity-captured peptides.
In this experiment, we afﬁnity- puriﬁed a peptide fraction attached to poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) using a boronic acid afﬁnity media.
The N-terminus of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a transcriptional factor [12], is known to carry the PAR moiety however, there is no method available to directly detect the peptide sequences car- rying this modiﬁcation. The afﬁnity puriﬁcation procedure in- cluded binding, washing and in situ mild alkaline hydrolysis, which led to detachment of the peptides from the modiﬁcation and their elution from the media.
The eluted peptides were subjected to the CID MS2 scan and the output was analyzed with peprep matching in silico digested peptides from N-terminus expected sequence VVGNMKPPKPTKIK gave a good pattern match to one of the analyzed spectra with a conﬁdent score.
No matching peptides were found when using either Mascot or TANDEM.
All datasets used for these examples are supplied with pepg- of CTCF. The rep package for testing purposes.
Discussion pepgrep offers a quick and friendly way to examine MS2 out- put data for the presence of a target peptide by matching MS2 spectrum patterns of modelled peptide sequence.
It is primarily designed for use with MS2 datasets generated by CID MS scan of a peptide mix subjected to targeted proteomics.

The matched spectrum can be in- stantly visualized during the search time or saved as an image and data ﬁle for later examination.
Tests with a vast range of samples of MS2 spectra from the PeptideAtlas repository (http://www.peptideatlas.org) revealed that the complemen- tary scoring using decoy peptide sequences helps to validate the searched sequence among large number of noisy spectra.
This approach also allows quick and conﬁdent detection of targeted sequences in chimeric spectra.
pepgrep can be easily plugged into targeted proteomic workﬂows as an additional module, which could help, for example, to select targeted sequences for quantitative SRM- MS or a similar experimental design where MS2 detection of a particular peptide sequence is required.
The difference in algorithms between PDS and pepgrep is illustrated in more de- tails in Figure 1.
While the current version of pepgrep is de- signed only for the analysis of CID datasets by using y/b-ion fragmentation patterns, it can be easily converted into c/z- ion matching module by modifying pepgrep code and thus making it possible to be used for other types of fragmentation like electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-MS. Although pepgrep was primarily designed for use with tar- geted proteomics, its ability to use a greater number of mass modiﬁers in pattern matching can also be implemented in shot- gun proteomics in a  post-discovery  stage.
Identiﬁcation of PTM-modiﬁed peptides remains a challenging task in discov- ery proteomics despite signiﬁcant progress made in the devel- opment of peptide tandem mass spectrometry during the last  130 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 127 132 pepgrep PDS Theoretical MS2 spectra for targeted peptide and its decoy permutations are generated.

The match between observed MS2 scan and theoretical MS2 spectrum is evaluated by using an engine-specific scoring algorithm.
Observed MS2 spectra are ranked score- wise and those above the threshold are reported.
Meaningfully matched theoretical MS2 spectra are ranked score-wise and candidate sequences are linked to corresponding input MS2 spectrum.
From the matched peptide sequences, scores are assigned to proteins in the database.
All proteins in the database with a significant score are returned in rank order.

decade and emerging new software products with new concepts for prediction and detection of PTMs. Numerous studies in shotgun proteomics showed that standard PDS alone cannot solve this task and should be reinforced with other methods and algorithms [13]. From the software point of view, there are several models that have been tested in proteomics work- ﬂows, which have been successful at detecting a broad range of PTMs. For example, PDS search can be successfully com- bined with de novo sequencing algorithm for ﬁltering databases based on sequence tags as it was implemented in the InsPecT project [14]. Another example illustrates the use of TANDEM in two-pass workﬂow [9], where the ﬁrst discovery stage with routine PDS was followed by the second search of a mini-data- base generated from proteins identiﬁed in the discovery stage with a broad range of PTM-related mass offsets included.
Sim- ilarly, pepgrep can be used for searching the patterns of poten- tially-modiﬁed peptides selected from a subset of peptides identiﬁed during a routine PDS run.
It is crucial that the MS2 dataset contains good quality ion fragmentation spectra with low noise to meet criteria of complementary tests using decoy sequences.
The use of a cluster computing environment with pepgrep makes it easier to handle large MS2 data ﬁles that are usually generated by LC MS run.
The described approach provides an easy solution for comprehensive analysis of CID MS2 datasets. Materials and methods pepgrep was built in Python programming language.
The mod- ule implements the numpy numeric library in all MS2 manipu- lation routines and also uses numpy array implementation for structured data handling and manipulation.
There are four class modules that provide functionality to pepgrep, which handle spectrum allocation, MS ﬁle input/output (IO) manip- ulations and MS2 spectrum routines, and build MS2 spectral models for peptide sequence with different types of fragmented ions.
Usage pepgrep.py [-options or @OptionFile] peptide sequence  - ﬁle ﬁle with peptide sequences input ms2 dataset. Options Options can be supplied with a command line or with a ﬁle. Command line options are the following: -ferr (digit) -perr (digit) -it (digit) -thr (Y N) -ﬁlter (Y N) -pw (digit) -pmﬁxed (Y N) -fdr (digit) mass tolerance for fragment ion mass tolerance for peptide intensity threshold.
The level of intensity above which peaks are considered signiﬁcant. This option should accompany thr option spectrum thresholding. This should be considered for quadrupole-time-of-ﬂight (Q-TOF) or ion trap types of data turns on ﬁltering the ﬁrst three tryptic y-ions.
This makes sense only for Q-TOF type of spectra predeﬁned peak width turns on or oﬀ peptide mass validation.
When turned on, pepgrep will select only spectra, for which both fragment and precursor masses of simulated and tested MS2 will match expected false discovery rate (FDR) (q) value threshold for Peptide-to-MS2 algorithm, below which the pattern match score is considered signiﬁcant  Chernukhin I / pepgrep: A Tool for Peptide MS/MS Pattern Matching There are four ﬁles located in pepgrep directory, which con- tain pre-set values for the auto-selection of options required for certain types of MS2 instruments.
These ﬁles include I. param for ion trap, Q.param for Q-TOF, T.param for triple quad and O.param for Orbitrap instruments.
The parameter ﬁle can be supplied with argument line using @ preﬁx. How- ever, the command line options will override options supplied with the ﬁle. -showgr -savegr -savedta uses graphical user interface (GUI) to display matched spectrum saves spectrum plot in a ﬁle stores MS2 data of matched spectrum in DTA ﬁle pepgrep on multicore computing environment The implementation of message passing interface (MPI) to py- thon, mpi4py or pypar library can be used with pepgrep, which included in pepgrep.mpi.py. MPI-pepgrep is normally is launched from pepgrep.sh shell script which invokes the corre- sponding Open MPI or MPICH2 libraries in a multiprocessor environment.
To use the MPI-pepgrep, it is necessary to build mssplitter binary tool from C++ source ﬁles supplied in the corresponding subdirectory. mssplitter is invoked before start- ing pepgrep.mpi.py to split the MS2 dataset in parts corre- sponding to the number of MPI processes.
The splitting of the original MS2 spectra ﬁle is done according to a spectrum boundary rather than the size of the resulting ﬁle. All spectra are indexed in split ﬁles to keep the original order of MS2 scans.
The command line for MPI-pepgrep is similar to single thread pepgrep, except that the invocation command line includes shell script pepgrep.sh, which is also included in pepgrep package.
File formats for MS2 dataset Four types of most common MS2 formats are supported, including MGF, DTA, PKL and MZXML. File formats are recognized by the ﬁle extension.
Peptide-to-MS2 scoring pepgrep uses Peptide-to-MS2 modelling algorithm for scor- ing the match between reference and observed patterns in MS2 spectral data for y- and b-ion fragmentation proﬁles. The module builds simulated MS2 m/z ion scans in a form of numpy arrays for the reference and decoy peptide se- quences at the same time.
The decoy sequences are gener- ated using random permutations of the original peptide sequence.
The optimal number of decoy sequences used in PMS was found to be equal to 1/3 of number of amino acid residues in the reference peptide.
This number was deducted empirically.
The input MS2 spectrum data are parsed into the numpy ar- rays through the iteration of the dataset. The reference and the input array data are compared using numpy functions for fast data manipulations in arrays.
The matched spectra are scored and the spectrum with the highest rank is subjected to comple- mentary test using MS2 decoy data built with decoy peptide se- quences (Figure 1). The score for a tested peptide is calculated using the following equation: S ¼ Iw  Y þ B jY  Bj þ 1 b ¼ 1:0 þ Ycontig þ Bcontig þ YBp :  b where Iw ¼ L P P It  I Im  Lm  z and 131 ð1Þ The scoring formula takes into account the relation to three major properties in potentially matched MS2 scan: (i) cumula- tive intensity weight (Iw) of the matched ions (adjusted to the- oretical intensities), (ii) the total number of y- and b- ions (biased towards the presence of the both types of ions) and (iii) number of scored contiguous ions (b). We refer to I and It as the intensity of a peak and theoretical intensity, respec- tively, which match the corresponding ion from a simulated spectrum.
Im is maximum intensity in the matched spectrum, Lm is the number of matched ions and Z is a charge state.
Y and B are the sums of matched y- and b- ions, respectively.
Ycontig and Bcontig refer to the number of contiguous y- and b- ions found, respectively, and YBp is equal to the number of pairs of y- and b- ions supposedly derived from the same fragment product.
L is the total number of ions in the model.
The range of score values produced is similar to the expecta- tion value produced by TANDEM and Mascot peptide score.
False discovery rate The statistical signiﬁcance in Peptide-to-MS2 scoring for both targeted and decoy peptide models was evaluated by imple- menting the negative binomial distribution model.
FDR was calculated for each produced score by invoking complemen- tary cumulative distribution function from scipy library with subsequent FDR adjustment to the generated P value.
The FDR threshold allows the user to manipulate the signiﬁcance criteria for selection of the matched MS2 models for output.
If FDR for any of MS2 models generated from decoy se- quences is less than or equal to a user-deﬁned threshold, then the spectrum is rejected regardless of the search result for the targeted sequence.
Spectrum ﬁltering pepgrep ﬁlters input MS2 data based on certain criteria per- taining to the quality of spectrum.
These include such condi- tions as minimal and maximal mass of the precursor ion, charge state, minimal number of fragment peaks and the ratio between high and low masses in the spectrum.
Spectrum thresholding The spectrum thresholding includes a single routine for cutting off the peaks that are found below the selected intensity thresh- old.
The intensity threshold can be supplied either with options or otherwise calculated programmatically based on the mass/ intensity distribution proﬁle of the spectrum.
It is optimized to be used primarily with Q-TOF and Orbitrap types of scans that usually display numerous low intensity noise peaks.
Post-translational modiﬁcations The mass offsets corresponding to various PTMs can be supplied in the ﬁle named.modiﬁcations , which can be  132 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 127 132 found in the MS root directory.
Practically, the number of PTMs could be limited only by the available system re- sources.
We have found no signiﬁcant degradation in perfor- mance, when pepgrep was tested with up to 60 PTMs included in the search using single PC Linux x86_64 system with 16 cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU, 2.40 GHz and 16 Gb memory.
Fixed and non-ﬁxed peptide masses ignoring peptide masses.
On output, is selected as an option, When non-ﬁxed peptide mass pepgrep scores match between MS2 ion fragments only (sequence tags) it reports the found matches in MS m/z data and the calcu- lated difference in mass between predicted and observed peptides.
If this option is not selected, then pepgrep will try to match both MS2 m/z data and peptide precursor masses for the spectrum to be scored.
Selecting Q-TOF-type MS2 by the presence of C-terminal y-ion ladder Typical Q-TOF-type of CID MS2 spectrum of a tryptic pep- tide can be easily distinguished from non-peptide spectra by the presence of the y-ion ladder containing ﬁrst three C-termi- nal amino acid ions.
Thus, a quick test for the presence of the ladder helps to eliminate non-peptide spectra from being pro- cessed. This routine is optional and included only in Q-TOF- speciﬁc parameters.
Visual support Matched MS2 spectra can be visualized with matplotlib mod- ule and/or saved to ﬁle for future visual examination.
