GDNF/RET signaling is required for ureter and kidney development, and cells lacking Ret are excluded from the tips of the branching ureteric bud in chimeric kidneys.
Here, we find that this exclusion results from earlier Ret-dependent cell rearrangements in the caudal Wolffian duct, which generate a specialized epithelial domain that later emerges as the tip of the primary ureteric bud.
By juxtaposing cells with elevated or reduced RET activity, we find that Wolffian duct cells compete, based on RET signaling levels, to contribute to this domain.
At the same time, the caudal Wolffian duct transiently converts from a simple to a pseudostratified epithelium, a process that does not require Ret.
Thus, both Ret-dependent cell movements and Ret-independent changes in the Wolffian duct epithelium contribute to ureteric bud formation.
INTRODUCTION Development of the kidney is initiated when the caudal region of the Wolffian duct (WD), an epithelial tube derived from interme diate mesoderm, swells and then buds out into the adjacent metanephric mesenchyme (MM).
This evagination, the ureteric bud (UB), then undergoes a complex process of branching morphogenesis to give rise to the renal collecting duct system, while it induces MM cells to form the nephron epithelia.
UB growth and branching are critical for normal urogenital develop ment and their failure leads to birth defects such as renal agen esis, hypoplasia, or congenital obstructive uropathy (Costantini, 2006; Dressler, 2006; Schedl, 2007; Shah et al., 2004).
While many signals and receptors that control these events have Develo been identified, little is known about the specific responses of WD or UB cells to these signals and how they lead to epithelial morphogenesis.
Similar questions remain in other organs that develop through branching morphogenesis (Davies, 2002; Sternlicht et al., 2006).
Studies in simpler organisms have yielded considerable insight into the cellular events that shape epithelial structures (Affolter et al., 2003; Pilot and Lecuit, 2005), and advances in genetic manipulation and imaging now make it feasible to address these questions in the context of mammalian organogenesis.
A key growth factor that promotes UB outgrowth and branching morphogenesis is GDNF, which is expressed by the MM and signals to WD and UB epithelial cells expressing the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and coreceptor GFRa1.
In developing kidneys, Ret and Gfra1 are expressed at the UB tips, a specialized domain where most of the cell prolifer ation and epithelial growth and branching occurs (Lin et al., 2001; Michael and Davies, 2004; Watanabe and Costantini, 2004), but not in the more differentiated UB trunks.
In mice lacking Ret, Gdnf, or Gfra1, the UB fails to form, leading to renal agenesis, or else it grows and branches very poorly, leading to severe renal hypodysplasia (reviewed in Costantini and Shakya, 2006).
Humans with renal agenesis also have a high frequency of RET mutations (Skinner et al., 2008).
Additional mouse genetic studies revealed that Ret and Gdnf are central components of a regulatory network that controls UB morphogenesis and kidney development (Schedl, 2007).
Specifically how GDNF/RET signaling alters the behavior of Wolffian duct and UB cells to promote branching remains unclear.
To investigate this issue, we previously developed an experimental system in which to analyze the fate of Ret/ cells in the developing kidney (Shakya et al., 2005).
Ret/ ES cells carrying the WD/UB transgenic marker Hoxb7/GFP were injected into wild-type (WT) blastocysts and their contribution to the resulting chimeric kidneys was examined.
When the UB first grew out from the WD, the mutant cells contributed exten sively to the WD and the UB trunk but were largely absent from the tip.
At later stages of branching, Ret/ cells pmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevier Inc. 199 mailto:fdc3@columbia.edu Developmental Cell Wolffian Duct Cell Movements and Ureteric Budding Figure 1.
Behavior of WT and Ret/ Cells during the Formation, Outgrowth, and Initial Branching of the UB (A) Ret/ ES cells carrying Hoxb7/GFP were injected into WT blastocysts, which were gener ated by crossing Hoxb7/Cre (Yu et al., 2002) and R26R-CFP mice (Srinivas et al., 2001).
Therefore, WD/ UB cells derived from the Ret/ ES cells expressed GFP, while those derived from the WT host expressed CFP.
Dissected urogenital regions were examined in whole mount.

contributed to some of the UB trunks but rarely to the more distal branches.
These results showed that Ret/ cells have a cell-autonomous inability to contribute to the tip domain of the primary UB.
As this domain contains the progenitors for most of the UB epithelium (Shakya et al., 2005; unpublished data), this early defect led to their exclusion from most of the col lecting duct system.
These findings raised the questions of what cellular events lead to the formation of the UB and why Ret is required for a cell to contribute to the tip, but not the trunk?
Here, we address these questions by following the behaviors of fluorescently marked mutant versus WT cells in time-lapse movies of organ cultures.
We find that defects in the behavior of Ret/ cells in chimeric embryos are visible even before the UB starts to form, when WT cells undergo extensive movements within the Wolffian duct epithelium to generate a domain that will become the first UB tip.
Next, we compare the ability of cells with increased or reduced RET signaling activity to contribute to the tip domain.
The results show that WD cells can compete with each other, based on their level of RET signaling, to generate the UB tip domain.
In normal (nonchimeric) Wolffian ducts, RET signaling is heterogeneous from cell to cell, and cells can move indepen dently of their neighbors, suggesting that Ret-dependent cell competition is a normal feature of the budding process.
We also observed that the swelling of the caudal WD before UB outgrowth reflects a transient conversion from a simple to a pseudostratified epithelium, but this process is independent of Ret.
Thus, both Ret-dependent and Ret-independent cell behaviors contribute to UB formation.
200 Developmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevie RESULTS In the First Step in UB Formation, WT Wolffian Duct Cells Are Rearranged to Form the Primary Tip Domain, while Ret/ Cells Are Excluded To investigate how Ret/ cells were excluded from the first UB tip (Shakya et al., 2005), we generated Ret/4WT chimeric embryos using host embryos that expressed CFP in the WD and UB (Figure 1A), so that the WT (CFP+) and mutant (GFP+) cells could be distinguished in live specimens.
At E9.5, before the caudal WD began to swell, the first step in UB formation, Ret/ cells were broadly distributed, apparently at random, throughout the WD (Figure 1B).
However, as the caudal WD swelled, it developed a localized region on the dorsal side composed almost entirely of wild-type cells (which we term the primary UB tip domain) (Figures 1C, 1D, 2A2C, 2F, and 2G).
As the UB began to evaginate, nearly all the mutant cells remained behind in the WD, while the wild-type cells formed the leading portion of the bud (the primary UB tip) (Figures 1D and 1E).
Only after the UB had begun to elongate did Ret/ cells follow the WT cells into the UB trunk (Figure 1F).
As the UB began to branch, mutant cells entered the proximal parts of the first two branches, while the two tips and the distal side of the branches were composed of WT cells (Figures 1G and 1H).
In contrast, in control chimeras, WT ES cells contribute randomly throughout the UB (Figure 1I) (Shakya et al., 2005).
Thus, the absence of Ret/ cells from the primary UB tip is a consequence of the rapid enrichment of WT cells in a Wolffian duct domain that will give rise to the UB tip, even before budding is initiated.

The rostral WD has a random distribution of mutant (GFP+) and WT cells, while in the caudal WD, Develo These observations raised the question: what is the cellular mechanism by which WT but not Ret/ cells form the UB tip domain?
Among the possibilities were differences in cell prolifer ation, survival, migration, and adhesion.
We previously specu lated that GDNF/RET signaling might cause the WT cells to proliferate rapidly in the forming tip domain and overgrow the mutant cells, which cannot respond to GDNF (Shakya et al., 2005).
Indeed, it was recently shown that Fgfr2/ cells are dis placed by proliferation of Fgfr2+/ cells in chimeric mammary gland terminal end buds (Lu et al., 2008).
However, measure ments of phosphohistone H3+ (pH3+) cells showed no significant difference between the mitotic index of WT versus Ret/ cells in chimeric Wolffian ducts (Figures 2D, 2F, and 2H) or in nonchi meric WT versus Ret/ embryos (data not shown).
Therefore, the paucity of mutant cells in the tip domain is not due to a prolif erative defect.
We also saw no evidence of cell death that could explain their depletion in this region (data not shown).
The occurrence of extensive cell rearrangements was first revealed by comparing the distribution of WT and Ret/ cells in the rostral versus caudal Wolffian duct at E10.5.
In the rostral duct, mutant cells appeared randomly distributed (e.g., Figures 2D and 2E), but in the caudal region of the same duct (Figures 2F and 2G), not only were mutant cells absent from the forming tip domain on the dorsal side, but they were highly enriched on the adjacent ventral side.
This indicated that WT and mutant cells had sorted to different domains.
In some situations, cells sort out based on differing expression of adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin (Steinberg, 2007).
We found that Ret/ cells expressed E-cadherin similarly to WT cells (Figures 2I and 2J); however, a role for other cell adhesion molecules has not been excluded.
The Caudal Wolffian Duct Forms a Pseudostratified Epithelium, in a Ret-Independent Process, before UB Outgrowth While examining WD sections, we observed that the caudal WD epithelium at E10.5 is multilayered (e.g., Figures 2F, 2I, and 2J).
While the caudal WD obviously increases in diameter before budding, its cellular organization has not been previously described.
Studies using Hoxb7/myr-Venus transgenic mice, which express a membrane-bound Venus fluorescent protein in the WD/UB lineage (Chi et al., 2009), showed that while the rostral WD at E10.5 is single layered, the caudal region is multi layered (Figures 3A3C0).
Both the dorsal and ventral sides of the duct are multilayered, but the dorsal side (where the UB will form) is often thicker.
While the nuclei are located at different levels along the apical-basal axis (Figure 3C0), many cells contact mutant cells are absent in the primary UB tip domain (dorsal region, on right) but enriched in the ventral region.

both the apical and basal surfaces (Figure 3C).
This is most easily seen in chimeric ducts, where only a fraction of cells express GFP (Figures 2F and 2G) or myr-Venus (Figure 5B).
Thus, the caudal WD is a pseudostratified rather than a truly stratified epithelium.
Pseudostratified epithelia are characterized by interkinetic nuclear migration (shuttling of nuclei between the apical and basal surfaces during the cell cycle), which causes M phase nuclei to be found only near the apical surface (Bort et al., 2006).
Staining with anti-pH3 (which labels late G2 and M phase nuclei) showed that nearly all pH3+ nuclei (138/140) in the caudal E10.5 WD were apical (e.g., Figures 3C and 3E).
At E11.5, the UB epithelium remains multilayered (Figures 3F and 3G), but by E14.5 it is again a simple epithelium (Figures 3H and 3I), consis tent with previous analyses (Chi et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2004).
Thus, the pseudostratified state is a transient phase that begins before initial budding and ends during early renal branching (Figure 3J).
Since the transition to pseudostratified epithelium occurs at the same stage as Ret-dependent cell rearrange ments, we asked whether Ret played a role in pseudostratified epithelium formation.
In Ret/4WT chimeric Wolffian ducts, both WT and mutant cells were found in the pseudostratified region (e.g., Figures 2F and 2I).
Furthermore, in Ret/ (nonchi meric) embryos, the caudal WD was pseudostratified (N = 6) (Figures 3E and 3E0).
Thus, this change in epithelial organization occurs independently of RET signaling.
The Distribution of WT and Mutant Cells Is Altered by Ret-Dependent Cell Movements within the Wolffian Duct Epithelium To investigate the processes by which WT and Ret/ cells occupy different domains of the WD, we performed time-lapse imaging of urogenital organ cultures.
Figures 4A and 4B and Movie S1 (available online) show a culture begun at E10.0 202 Developmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsev (32 somites) in which formation of the primary UB tip domain could be followed.
Initially, the WT and mutant cells appeared randomly interspersed throughout the WD, but by 24 hr a cluster of WT (CFP+) cells could be observed at the prospective site of ureteric budding (arrows).
In the merged GFP/CFP images (Figure 4A) the behavior of CFP+ versus GFP+ cells could not be distinguished until the tip domain had formed.
However, the CFP channel revealed that the WT cells were at first widely dispersed but gradually moved together into a cluster (Figure 4B, brackets), while the mutant cells remained dispersed (Figure 4A).
Urogenital cultures initiated at this early stage rarely progress to the stage of UB outgrowth, so to examine subsequent events we started cultures at E10.5 (3638 somites).
Figures 4C4F (Movies S2, S2A, and S2B) illustrate primary UB tip domain formation as well as UB outgrowth in a Ret/4WT chimera.
The primary UB tip domains had already formed (Figure 4C, arrows), but during culture several ectopic buds emerged from the WDs and their origins could be followed from an early stage (Ret/4WT chimeras often form ectopic UBs in addition to the normal UB; see Discussion).
In the merged GFP/CFP images (Figures 4C and 4D), the sequence of budding events was similar to that illustrated in Figure 1.
However, the CFP channel (Figures 1E and 1F; Movies S2, S2A, and S2B) showed that the WT cells were at first broadly distributed along the Wolffian ducts (brackets, 0 hr), then converged into tight clusters (817 hr).
They next changed direction and emerged as the tip of a UB (Figures 1E and 1F; 1728 hr).
The mutant (GFP+) cells did not appear to undergo any such concerted movements (Movie S2).
Based on extensive analysis of sections and confocal images (Figure 2; data not shown), the moving cells do not delaminate, but remain part of the WD epithelium throughout the process.
These observations indicate that an important function of Ret in the WD is to mediate the rearrange ment of epithelial cells to form the primary UB tip domain.

Scale bars: 100 mM.
Develo The caudal-most segment of the WD, the common nephric duct (CND), also became enriched for WT cells by the comigra tion of initially dispersed WT cells (asterisks, Figures 2A and 4A4C).
During ureter maturation, CND expansion followed by apoptosis is crucial for separating the ureter from its original insertion site in the WD and repositioning it to its final insertion site in the bladder neck (Batourina et al., 2005).
This process depends on Ret expression in the CND, but it has been unclear at which stage in CND remodeling Ret acts.
The observation that the expanded CND in Ret/4WT chimeras is composed mainly of WT cells suggests that Ret-dependent cell movements are important to generate other components of the urogenital system in addition to the UB tip.
Despite the specialized junctions between epithelial cells that maintain cell contacts and epithelial integrity, there are extensive cell movements in many growing epithelial structures, requiring that the cell junctions be frequently remodeled (Gumbiner, 2005; Lecuit, 2005).
Extensive, but apparently random, epithelial cell rearrangements have been previously observed during branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney (Shakya et al., 2005), mammary gland (Ewald et al., 2008), and salivary gland (Larsen et al., 2006).
In contrast, the present observations reveal a different type of rearrangement that appears tightly orchestrated, is controlled by Ret, and patterns the Wolffian duct into distinct functional domains.
Wolffian Duct Cells Compete Based on the Level of RET Signaling to Form the UB Tip Domain In the developing Drosophila respiratory epithelium, cell move ments to the tip of the air sac or tracheal branch are governed by competition among cells based on FGF signaling levels (Cabernard and Affolter, 2005; Ghabrial and Krasnow, 2006).
To ask if WD cells can compete in a similar manner, based on RET signaling, we used a genetic approach employing a Sprouty1 (Spry1) null allele that increases RET signaling and a hypomorphic Ret allele that decreases it.
Spry1 is a feedback inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, which is required to negatively regulate GDNF/RET signaling (Basson et al., 2005).
Spry1/ mice develop multiple UBs, leading to multiple ureters and multiplex kidneys, due to increased sensi tivity to GDNF (Basson et al., 2005; Basson et al., 2006).
Thus, Spry1/ Wolffian duct cells have elevated RET signaling and, according to a competition model, should prevail over WT cells to form the UB tip domain.
Spry1/ ES cells carrying Hoxb7/myr-Venus were used to produce Spry1/4WT chimeras.
In a chimera cultured from E9.5 (Figure 5A), the mutant (green) cells were initially dispersed along the Wolffian duct among WT (CFP+) cells but were later rearranged into two clusters, one corresponding to the presumptive UB tip domain and one to the CND.
This is opposite to the rearrangements in Ret/4WT chimeras, where WT cells form the UB tip domain and CND (Figures 4A and 4B).
In chimeric Wolffian ducts atE10, the Spry1/ cells were distributed in a pattern opposite to that seen with Ret/ cells: they were enriched in the dorsal side, where the tip domain is forming (Figure 5B).
Time-lapse imaging (Figure 5C-D; Movies S3 and S4) illus trates the behavior of Spry1/ versus WT cells during UB outgrowth and branching.
Figure 5C shows a chimeric WD that pmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevier Inc. 203 Developmental Cell Wolffian Duct Cell Movements and Ureteric Budding had formed a single UB tip domain at the early budding stage that was highly enriched in Spry1/ cells.
As the UB branched, Spry1/ cells were preferentially found in the tips and distal branches, where WT cells were underrepresented.
Figure 5D shows another chimeric WD that generated three UBs, as do many Spry1/ WDs (Basson et al., 2005).
The Spry1/ cells, which were already enriched on the dorsal side at E10.5, segre gated into three clusters that evaginated as the tips of three UBs, while WT cells were depleted in the tips.
Thus, the behavior of WT cells varies drastically depending on whether they are competing with Ret/ cells or Spry1/ cells.
To further test the model of RET signaling-based competition, we used a hypomorphic Ret mutant, Rettm2(RET)Vpa (de Graaff et al., 2001), as the host strain.
Rettm2(RET)Vpa/tm2(RET)Vpa homozy gotes have milder defects than Ret/ homozygotes, including small kidneys with reduced branching, but not renal agenesis.
Like Ret+/ mice, Rettm2(RET)Vpa heterozygotes are normal.
The Ret/ ES cells, or control Ret+/ ES cells, were injected into Ret-hypomorphic or control host blastocysts, and their contribu tion to the UB was analyzed.
When injected into normal host embryos (Figures 6A, 6B, 6E, and 6F), Ret/ cells were found mainly in the ureter and early UB branch generations, with very few in the distal branches or tips, as previously observed (Shakya et al., 2005).
In contrast, when the same Ret/ ES cells Figure 5.

The control Ret+/ ES cells contributed evenly to all regions of the UB in a WT host (Fig ure 6I), as previously reported (Shakya et al., 2005), consistent with the observa tion that loss of one Ret allele has no effect on kidney development (Schu chardt et al., 1994).
In Ret-hypomorphic hosts, the control ES cells also contrib uted to all regions of the UB, but appeared somewhat enriched in the tips compared to trunks (Figure 6J).
Thus, the fate of Ret/ cells in a chimeric UB is altered by the Ret genotype of the host embryo, further supporting a competi tive model of UB tip domain formation.
This indicates that the Ret/ cells are not inherently unable to contribute to the UB tip (perhaps because of functional overlap between Ret and other RTKs), and they contribute more successfully in a host with reduced RET signaling.
Wolffian Duct Cells in Normal Embryos Display Heterogeneous RET Signaling and Independent Cell Movements What do the cell rearrangements in embryos chimeric for Ret (summarized in Figures 7A7C) reveal about normal develop ment, where every cell is WT?
One possibility is that a subset of WD cells normally achieves higher levels of RET signaling than their neighbors and preferentially migrates to contribute to the UB tip domain.
Two predictions from this model are that (1) WD cells display locally heterogeneous levels of RET expression and/or signaling, and (2) some WD cells move independently of their neighbors during budding.
While Ret gene expression was homogenous among WD cells (Figure 7D), RET signaling appeared heterogeneous.
Erk MAP 204 Developmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevier Inc. Developmental Cell Wolffian Duct Cell Movements and Ureteric Budding kinase is phosphorylated upon RET signaling (Takahashi, 2001), and the diphosphrylated form (dp-Erk) is an established indicator of RTK signaling (Corson et al., 2003; Lunn et al., 2007).
In E10.5 WT embryos, dp-Erk staining was localized in the dorsal part of the caudal WD (Figure 7E, arrows), corresponding to the site of primary tip domain formation (Figures 1 and 2) and adjacent to Figure 6.

In contrast, the Ret/ WD was dp-Erk-negative (Figure 7F), indicating that dp-Erk is a reporter of RET activity in the WD.
Sections from E1010.5 wild-type WDs revealed extensive cell-to-cell hetero geneity in dp-Erk staining (Figures 7G7J), indicating that neigh boring WD cells can differ considerably in RET signaling levels.
To examine cell movements in nonchimeric Wolffian ducts, we induced expression of YFP by crossing a R26RYFP Cre-reporter (Srinivas et al., 2001) to an inducible Cre allele expressed in the WD (RetCreERT2) and inducing Cre activity with Tamoxifen.
Recombination leading to YFP expression occurs in a subset of cells, which should be random with respect to differences in RET signaling level.
In several cultured explants with low percentages of YFP+ cells, it was possible to follow cell move ments during budding.
Figures 7K and 7L show two examples in which several neighboring cells displayed independent move ments, some contributing to a forming bud (yellow brackets) and others remaining behind in the duct (red brackets).
Thus, not only in chimeras, but also in Wolffian ducts genetically uniform for Ret, some cells undergo extensive movement with respect to their neighbors.
Together, these observations suggest that the competitive sorting of Wolffian duct cells in Ret4WT or Spry14WT chimeras reflects a normal process of Ret-depen dent cell rearrangements.
DISCUSSION Branching morphogenesis is a critical process in the develop ment of many organs, including the kidneys (Davies, 2002).
However, its cellular basis is poorly understood, particularly in mammals for which there are few experimental systems to manipulate and visualize the process of organogenesis.
In this paper, we used time-lapse imaging of chimeric organ cultures to investigate the processes by which the first UB tip is gener ated, a Ret-dependent event crucial for ureter and kidney devel opment.
We find that Ret-expressing Wolffian duct cells undergo extensive movements to generate a specialized epithelial domain that gives rise to the first UB tip, while cells lacking Ret are excluded.
Chimeric studies that juxtapose cells with different levels of RET activity, as well as analyses of cell movements and RET signaling in the WT Wolffian duct, suggest that these rearrangements result from competition among cells based on the level of signaling, a mechanism with interesting parallels to those described in branching fly epithelia (Affolter and Caussi nus, 2008).
We also found that ureteric budding is preceded by the formation of a pseudostratified epithelium in the caudal WD, a process that is independent of Ret.
These studies provide new insight into cellular events during the initiating steps of renal development and how they are influenced by GDNF/RET signaling.
The Wolffian Duct Forms a Pseudostratified Epithelium Independently of Ret Activity The WD derives from a cord of cells that converts to a simple epithelial tube, which elongates caudally between E8.5 and E9.5.
At these stages, Ret is not yet required for cells to contribute to any region of the WD.
At E10.0, the caudal WD starts to swell as the epithelium becomes pseudostratified (Figure 3).
This region exhibits higher cell proliferation than the pmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevier Inc. 205 Developmental Cell Wolffian Duct Cell Movements and Ureteric Budding Figure 7.

rostral WD (Figure 2H) (Michael and Davies, 2004), which may generate the extra cells needed to form a pseudostratified region.
Interestingly, pseudostratified domains are formed in several other epithelial structures that are about to produce an outgrowth, including the ectodermal mammary line (Veltmaat et al., 2004) and otic placodes (Meier, 1978) and the endodermal liver and thyroid buds (Bort et al., 2006; Fagman et al., 2006).
In liver bud development, the Hex homeobox gene is required for pseudostratification and for the subsequent delamination of hepatoblasts into the stroma (Bort et al., 2006).
In the WD/UB lineage, the pseudostratified epithelium is also a transient state, but cells do not delaminate.
Instead, part of the pseudostratified region evaginates, giving rise to the UB.
While the importance of WD pseudostratification remains to be elucidated, we speculate that pseudostratified epithelium formation may serve to generate a high cell density in the prebudding region, which permits rapid outgrowth and branching of the UB.
The mammary epithelium also contains multilayered regions at the terminal end buds (TEBs), which are important for branching (Sternlicht et al., 2006), but the TEBs are not pseudostratified.
Another difference is that the UB reverts to a simple epithelium by E14.5, while still growing and branching; thus, the pseudos tratified epithelium is not required for later stages of UB branch ing morphogenesis.
Ret-dependent cell movements to form the primary UB tip domain occur while the caudal WD is becoming pseudostrati fied.
However, Ret/ cells contribute to the pseudostratified regions of chimeric WDs (although rarely to the dorsally-located primary UB tip domain), and in Ret/ homozygotes the caudal WD becomes pseudostratified, despite the failure of ureteric budding in most Ret/ embryos (Schuchardt et al., 1996).
Therefore, GDNF/RET signaling is dispensable for pseudostrati206 Developmental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevi fied epithelium formation.
Given the proximity of the metanephric mesenchyme to the caudal WD, other signals from the MM are likely to induce this event.
In support of this hypothesis, in embryos lacking Osr1, a transcription factor expressed in the MM and required for its normal differentiation from the interme diate mesoderm, the caudal WD remains a narrow tube (James et al., 2006, Figure 3; Mugford et al., 2008, Figure 7), failing to become pseudostratified.
The Primary UB Tip Domain Is Generated by Cell Movements in the Wolffian Duct Stimulated by Ret While the caudal WD is becoming pseudostratified but before budding, extensive cell rearrangements are observed in cultured Ret/4WT chimeras.
Many of the WT cells converge toward the future site of budding, forming a dorsal domain of the epithe lium that is composed almost entirely of WT cells and later emerges to form the first UB tip.
Cell movements are visible mainly along the rostral-caudal axis of the WD, but they also seem to occur along the dorsal-ventral axis, as the dorsal side becomes enriched and the ventral side depleted of WT cells.
These studies provide strong evidence that Ret-dependent cell movements are important for epithelial morphogenesis during the initiation of ureter and kidney development.
What directs these cell movements?
RET signaling might alter the adhesive properties of cells, so that WT cells are passively sorted from mutant cells, based on adhesive differences (Lecuit, 2005; Steinberg, 2007).
However, it seems unlikely that cell adhesion alone could cause the observed cell movements to a specific location where the UB will form, and the time-lapse movies suggest a directed migration.
GDNF can serve as a chemoattractant for Ret-expressing cells in culture (Tang et al., 1998) and for enteric neuroblasts (Natarajan et al., 2002).
er Inc. Developmental Cell Wolffian Duct Cell Movements and Ureteric Budding However, the broad expression domain of GDNF (Figure 7A) and the predominantly longitudinal cell movements (perpendicular to the source of GDNF) argues against a model in which cells are simply migrating toward the GDNF source.
Another possibility is that RET signaling induces the WD cells to express other molecules that promote attraction (e.g., secreted chemoattrac tants and/or receptors), leading to their convergence.
Later, when the UB tip starts to emerge and grow laterally into the MM, it is likely that GDNF serves as a chemoattractant (Sainio et al., 1997).
However, since the UB emerges and grows toward the MM in some embryos that lack Ret or Gdnf entirely (Costan tini, 2006), other mesenchymal signals must also participate.
As noted above, it was surprising that Ret/4 WT chimeric Wolffian ducts often formed one or more ectopic UBs (Figure 4C), yet only the WT cells formed the tips of these UBs.
Interestingly, in embryos genetically mosaic for Gata3, a tran scription factor upstream of Ret, Ret is expressed only in the subset of WD cells retaining Gata3, and the WD also forms numerous ectopic buds (Grote et al., 2008).
A possible unifying explanation is that RET signaling normally causes a subset of WD cells to attract each other and converge to form a single primary UB tip domain, but random clusters of cells lacking Ret can locally disrupt this process, causing the WT cells to form multiple clusters, each generating a UB tip.
Wolffian Duct Cells that Form the UB Tip Domain Are Selected through Competition Based on the Level of RET Signaling Further insight into the role of Ret in formation of the UB tip domain was obtained from studies of Spry1/4WT and Ret/4Ret-hypomorphic chimeras.
In these experiments, the behavior of cells with a given level of RET signaling was strongly altered by the genotype of the cells with which they were asked to compete.
First, when WT cells were mixed with Ret/ cells, they preferentially formed the UB tips, but when mixed with Spry1/ cells (with elevated RET signaling), the WT cells were depleted in the tips.
Second, when Ret/ cells were mixed with WT cells, they were almost entirely absent from the UB tips, but when mixed with Ret-hypomorphic cells, they contributed more exten sively to the tips.
The fact that Ret/ cells can contribute to the UB tip domain in a Ret-hypomorphic background suggests that the difference in signaling levels between Ret null and hypomorphic cells is not great enough for the hypomorphic cells to fully out-compete the null cells.
Thus, there is not an absolute requirement for RET signaling for a cell to contribute to the UB tip, and other growth factors and RTKs may also partic ipate in this process (one candidate is FGF10, which synergizes with GDNF to promote UB outgrowth and branching; O.M.
and F.C., unpublished data).
However, when cells with stronger RET signaling are present, they will generally outperform those with a lower level.
These processes have striking parallels with cell movements in the developing Drosophila respiratory epithe lium, which are governed by FGF-based competition (Cabernard and Affolter, 2005; Ghabrial and Krasnow, 2006).
Thus, RTK signaling-based cell competition may be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of epithelial branching morphogenesis.
While the competitive cell behaviors were revealed in chimeric embryos, where cells with different Ret (or Spry1) genotypes were purposely juxtaposed, our data suggest that the forced Develop cell competition in a chimera reflects a similar process occurring during normal ureteric budding.
This conclusion is based, first, on the heterogeneity in RET signaling among WT WD cells, as revealed by dp-Erk staining, and second, on the apparently inde pendent movements of neighboring WD cells during bud forma tion.
We predict (although it has not yet been possible to prove) that the cells in WT embryos that preferentially contribute to the forming UB tip correspond to those with higher levels of RET signaling, as they do in the chimeric embryos.
While the cause of heterogeneous signaling is not clear, it could result from vari able expression of signaling components downstream of RET, from some form of lateral inhibition, or from stochastic variation in binding the limited GDNF available (Costantini and Shakya, 2006).
Heterogenous dp-Erk staining can also be observed in other developing tissues (e.g., Lunn et al., 2007, Figure 3).
Addi tionally, in developing blood vessels, mosaic activation of the RTK FLK-1 in a subset of endothelial cells is important for vessel branching (Kappas et al., 2008).
We propose that heterogeneity in RET signaling among WD cells serves to refine and focus the site of UB outgrowth.
Since the mesenchymal domain of GDNF expression is quite broad, a uniform response by all the WD cells exposed to GDNF might be expected to form a massive swelling rather than a discrete bud.
Instead, we suggest that a subset of caudal WD cells pref erentially respond to the GDNF signal, migrate together into a narrower cluster adjacent to the center of the GDNF-express ing MM domain, then grow out at the tip of a discrete bud, while cells with lower RET signaling follow and form the UB trunk.
Possible Implications for the Mechanism of UB Branching While budding from the WD represents the first branching event leading to ureter and kidney development, it differs from later UB branching, which is primarily dichotomous and occurs mainly at the UB termini (Lin et al., 2001; Watanabe and Costantini, 2004).
Thus, formation of the primary UB tip domain might use mecha nisms that are unique to this initial branching event.
However, Ret continues to be expressed at the UB tips, and normal renal branching requires the continued function of Ret and Gdnf (Cos tantini and Shakya, 2006).
This raises the possibility that Ret dependent cell movements are important beyond their early role in the WD.
In particular, the results suggest a model in which an attraction among Ret-expressing UB cells may keep them at the UB tips (and thus maintain the tip-specific pattern of Ret expression), while those cells in which Ret expression is down regulated are out-competed and contribute to the trunks.
Studies in which RET signaling is manipulated in individual UB cells should help to test this model.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Ret/ ES cells carrying Hoxb7/GFP were as described (Shakya et al., 2005) and Spry1/ ES cells carrying Hoxb7/myr-Venus (Chi et al., 2009) were derived similarly.
Generation of Chimeras, YFP Mosaics, and Organ Culture Chimeric embryos generated by blastocyst injection were recovered and urogenital systems were cultured and imaged as described (Srinivas et al., 1999; Watanabe and Costantini, 2004).
For injection into Rettm2(RET)Vpa hosts, mental Cell 17, 199209, August 18, 2009 2009 Elsevier Inc. 207 Developmental Cell Wolffian Duct Cell Movements and Ureteric Budding blastocysts were derived from Rettm2(RET)Vpa/+ intercrosses; 25% were Rettm2(RET)Vpa/tm2(RET)Vpa.
The host embryo was genotyped (de Graaff et al., 2001) retrospectively, using yolk sac visceral endoderm (derived only from the host) separated from the chimeric mesoderm (Hogan et al., 1994).
RetCreERT2/+; R26RYFP/+ embryos were YFP-labeled by injecting the mother with 12 mg Tamoxifen in corn oil.
RetCreERT2 mice, carrying CreERT2 inserted at the Ret locus, will be described elsewhere.
Immunofluorescence Microscopy Primary antibodies were against cytokeratin (Sigma), GFP (Molecular Probes), phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) (6G3) (Cell Signaling), and E-cadherin (BD Trans duction Laboratories).
Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (3 hr, 4C), washed 33 in PBS, equilibrated in 30% sucrose/PBS, embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek), and dry-ice frozen.
Cryosections (7 mM) were post-fixed with 4% PFA (10 min, 4C), blocked in 2% donkey serum (Sigma) with 1% BSA in PBT at room temperature (RT) for 1 hr, incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies in PBT (overnight, 4C), washed, and incubated in a mixture of fluo rescent secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (RT, 2 hr).
Sections were stained with Hoechst 33342, mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector Labora tories), and photographed by Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 or Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope.
For cell proliferation assays, total, mutant (GFP+), and pH3+ WD cells were counted in sections from the mesonephric tubules to the caudal end in three chimeras and compared by chi-square test.
Apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL using in situ cell death detection kit (TMR red, Roche).
Immunohistochemical Staining for dp-Erk Frozen sections (10 mm) were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at RT, then incu bated with anti-dp-Erk2 (Sigma, mouse IgG1, 1:100) overnight at 4 C, followed by biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (SouthernBiotech, 1:200) for 3 hr at RT.
After PBS washes, the sections were incubated with ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories) for 45 min at RT, followed by color reaction with a peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories).
