Using a strand-speciﬁc RNA-seq analysis, we compared the in vitro transcriptomes of these two Chinese isolates with that of a reference strain (P1/7). In the 89K genomic island that is speciﬁc to these Chinese isolates, a toxin antitoxin system showed rel- atively high levels of transcription among the S. suis. The known virulence factors with high tran- scriptional activity in these two highly-pathogenic strains are mainly involved in adhesion, bioﬁlm formation, hemolysis and the synthesis and transport of the outer membrane protein.
Furthermore, our analysis of novel transcripts identiﬁed over 50 protein-coding genes with one of them encoding a toxin protein.
We also predicted over 30 small RNAs (sRNAs) in each strain, and most of them are involved in riboswitches. We found that six sRNA candidates that are related to bacterial vir- ulence, including cspA and rli38, are speciﬁc to Chinese isolates.
These results provide insight into the factors responsible for the difference in virulence among the different S. suis 2 isolates.

They can also infect humans that have direct contact with infected swine, causing meningitis, hearing loss and septic shock [1 3]. In China, two large-scale outbreaks of severe human infections of S. suis 2 were reported in 1998 and 2005, respectively [4]. S. suis 2 is also one of the major pathogens associated with bacterial meningitis in other Asian areas, such as Hong Kong and Thailand [5 7]. Therefore, it poses a signiﬁcant threat to public health [8]. The known markers of S. suis 2 include capsular polysac- charide (CPS), muramidase release protein (MRP), elongation http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2014.11.001 1672-0229 ª 2014 The Authors.

Zhang D et al / Transcriptome Analysis of Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 267 factor (EF) and suilysin (SLY) [9]. The capsule is one of the key factors involved in bacterial pathogenicity. For instance, S. suis capsular polysaccharide inhibits phagocytosis through destabilization of lipid microdomains and prevents lactosylcer- amide-dependent recognition [9]. The capsule also protects the bacteria against phagocytosis. The Ssa protein of S. suis 2, a surface-anchored ﬁbronectin-binding protein, also facilitates epithelial cell invasion [7]. In bacteria, two-component systems (TCSs) are crucial devices that enable their adaption to chang- ing growth conditions, and hence affect bacterial virulence.
More than 15 TCSs have been reported in S. suis 2 so far [4]. They are believed to facilitate bacterial adherence to muco- sal epithelium cells, to participate in the process of capsular wall formation, and they have been shown to help bacteria sur- vive and proliferate in in vivo mouse models [10 15]. More- over, other regions of the S. suis 2 genome may contribute to its virulence as well [16]. In 2007, Chen et al. sequenced the whole genomes of the two S. suis 2 strains 05ZYH33 and Chinese isolates of 98HAH33, which were involved in the two aforementioned outbreaks, respectively [4]. Comparison of the genomes of these two Chinese strains with that of the reference genome, P1/7, suggested that an 89K genomic island (GI) is responsible for the altered pathogenicity of the Chinese isolates.
Further analyses revealed that this 89K GI contains important viru- lence factors, including zeta toxin, TCS and ATP-binding cas- sette (ABC) transporters.
Functional experiments revealed a dramatic decrease in the virulence of 05ZYH33 following the disruption of the TCS in the 89K GI [15]. Moreover, this 89K GI can be transmitted across different strains, and thus might represent a mechanism that enables S. suis 2 to adapt quickly to the local environment [17]. Although gene prediction methods have been widely applied in bacterial genome annotation, the use of next-gener- ation sequencing (NGS) technology often reveals various novel transcripts, especially those belonging to the diverse small RNA (sRNA) families [18]. The regulatory role of these sRNAs in gene expression and in bacterial virulence is only now being slowly elucidated [19 22]. Here, we provide the ﬁrst RNA-seq datasets from two Chinese isolates of S. suis 2.
Results Transcriptome analysis pipeline and data statistics We performed a strand-speciﬁc sequencing of the in vitro tran- scriptomes of three S. suis 2 strains, including the two highly- virulent isolates 05ZYH33 and 98HAH33, and the reference strain P1/7. About 27 40 million uniquely-mapped reads were obtained for each transcriptome, while achieving a good sequencing depth for further analysis (Table 1 and Figure S1). The regions with a single-nucleotide resolution sequencing coverage greater than 3  accounted for over 93%, 92% and 95% of the whole genome of the 05ZYH33, 98HAH33 and P1/7 strains, respectively (data not shown). These percentages were similar to those previously reported for Bacillus anthracis (94%), Burkholderia mallei (95%) and Sulfolobus solfataricus (89.5%) [23 25], demonstrating the reliability of our datasets. Analysis of differential gene expression in homologous genes To compare the gene expression levels among the three isolates, we ﬁrst identiﬁed their homologous genes (Materials and methods and Figure 1). Overall, 1672 homologous genes were identiﬁed in the three stains, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using three software packages (Materials and methods). In total, 318 genes were differentially expressed between 05ZYH33 and P1/7 strains, and 231 DEGs were identiﬁed between 98HAH33 and P1/7 strains.
There were 120 DEGs common to these two comparisons (Table S1). Among them, expression of about 50% genes was upregulated 98HAH33 05ZYH33 P1/7 RNA-seq datasets S. suis 2 transcriptome Read mapping  Genic region  Intergenic region  DEG analysis  TARs   Homologous genes (cid:129) COG & KEGG pathway analysis    (cid:129) Genes in 89K GI (cid:129) Known virulence factors (cid:129) Novel protein coding genes (cid:129) Novel sRNAs  )mafR/mafP/IBCN( Figure 1 The pipeline for S. suis 2 transcriptome analysis Sequencing reads were ﬁrst mapped to reference genome.

Interestingly, most upregulated genes encode surface-anchored proteins, whereas the downregulated genes were enriched in the b-glucoside- speciﬁc phosphotransferase system (PTS) (Table S1). The most downregulated gene in the Chinese strains was SSU05_1491/ SSU98_1502 (SSU1310, the homologous gene in P1/7), which encodes a transcriptional anti-terminator (Table S1). The two Chinese isolates shared 246 additional homolo- gous genes (not shown).

The expression levels of DEGs in two Chinese isolates are more similar compared to P1/7. genes comparing with the reference isolate, eight were seen in both isolates.
For example, SSU05_0582/SSU98_0586 encodes the IS5 family transposase, whereas SSU05_0179/SSSSU98_ 0181 are exoprotein A genes from the RTX family and the encoded protein was reported to cause hemolysis [26]. Clusters of orthologous group analysis For all the genes annotated in previous studies, further scru- tiny of the gene expression data revealed that 2092, 2094 and 1890 genes were identiﬁed with reads per kilo bases per million reads (RPKM) 1, which accounted for 92.8%, 92.9% and 94% of all genes in 05ZYH33, 98HAH33 and P1/7 strains, respectively.
Among them, 1737, 1712 and 1559 genes were annotated with known clusters of orthol- ogous groups (COG) functions in 05ZYH33, 98HAH33 and P1/7, respectively.
A similar gene distribution in COGs was observed for all three strains (Figure S2), which indicates the similar biological processes can be observed in all three isolates.
To investigate the biological processes and show different activity in two Chinese isolates comparing with P1/7 isolate, we further analyzed the classiﬁcation of the 120 aforemen- tioned DEGs and found that 96 genes were classiﬁed into four major functional categories with 16 subgroups (Figure 3). Among the homologous genes that were upregulated in the Chinese isolates, 15 were signiﬁcantly enriched in the func- tional group of translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (P  0.000005, Fisher s exact test). Meanwhile, among the homologous genes that were downregulated in the Chinese iso- lates, 22 signiﬁcantly-enriched genes (P  0.00000005, Fisher s exact test) fall into the COG subgroup of carbohydrate transport and metabolism.

Zhang D et al / Transcriptome Analysis of Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 269 KEGG pathway analysis KEGG pathway mapping revealed that the biological pro- cesses that were abundant in the DEGs mainly include PTS, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and ribosome (Table 2 and Figures S3 S5) (P  0.01). Although all three strains shared the species-speciﬁc com- ponents in the PTS pathway, fewer transcripts of the Man fam- ily genes were detected in 98HAH33 and 05ZYH33 (Figure S3). Conversely, most Gk family genes except BgIF (PTS system, b-glucosides-speciﬁc II component) had more transcripts detected in the two Chinese isolates.
However, it is of note that BgIF is the most downregulated gene in PTS pathway, suggesting a reduced conversion from b-glucosides to phospho-b-glucosides. the level of In addition, transcriptional the genes (SSU05_0398/SSU98_0384) transforming arbutin and salicin into arbutin-6p and salicin-6p, respectively, was increased, whereas the transcriptional activity of down- stream 6-phospho-b-glucosidase (Enzyme Commission num- ber: 3.2.1.86, encoded by SSU05_1489/SSU98_1500 and responsible for SSU05_2079/SSU98_2083) was extensively repressed in the two Chinese isolates (Figure S4). Therefore, their products arbutin-6p and salicin-6p may accumulate in the bacterial metabolites of the two Chinese isolates.
Differential expression levels of known virulence factors It is believed that two Chinese isolates are more pathogenic than P1/7 isolate, and we next analyzed transcriptional level of all known virulence factors in three isolates.
Our analysis indicated that these three isolates had 96 known virulence fac- tors in common according to VFDB. However, only the gene encoding ORF46-putative ABC transporter membrane protein (SSU05_0111/SSU98_0114/SSU0114, VFG1497) was highly expressed in the Chinese isolates whereas expression of three genes SSU05_0148/SSU98_0152/SSU0147, SSU05_1381/SSU98_1396/SSU0466 SSU05_1387/ SSU98_1401/SSU1215, were downregulated (Table 3).

The KEGG analysis revealed that the ABC transporter pathway was enriched in the highly-expressed virulence factors in the 98HAH33 and 05ZYH33 (Table S2). Furthermore, seven other virulence factors were found to be speciﬁc to the two virulence strains (Table 3). For instance, The RPKM value of SSU05_1281/SSU98_1295 ranked the top among those of the seven factors.
SSU05_1281/SSU98_1295 encodes (RfaJ), which adds a glucose (II) group on the galactose (I) group of lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

In this region, 98HAH33 and 05ZYH33 strains have 78 homologous genes.
Among them, 59 genes had P 3 sequencing reads recov- ered in the RNA-seq datasets. The distribution of the RPKM values for all of these genes in the two strains showed that highest number of genes had RPKM values  1, indicating a low transcriptional activity during in vitro culture (Figure 4). Three known virulence factors speciﬁc to the Chinese isolates, including VFG0284, VFG2173 and VFG1453 (Table 3), were located in this GI as well.
Six genes with high transcriptional activity were seen in both strains (Table 4). According to the STRING database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, http://www.string-db.org/), recognition particle GTPase encoded by SSU05_0936/SSU98_0943 and a tran- scriptional regulator encoded by SSU05_0937/SSU98_0944 can form a toxin antitoxin (TA) system.

272 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 266 275 Novel transcripts identiﬁed in the transcriptomes of three isolates Gene annotation of these three isolates is mainly based on pre- diction method, and we used transcriptome data to ﬁnd novel genes in three genomes.
In all, over 50 novel transcriptionally- active regions (TARs) were identiﬁed in intergenic regions of the two Chinese isolates (see Material and Method). Most of them were homologous to genes that only encode hypothetical proteins (Table S3). Only 9 and 8 TARs had homologous genes with known functions and 98HAH33, respectively (Table 5). In particular, one TAR pre- dicted to encode a toxin protein was identiﬁed in both isolates.
We also predicted 56 sRNAs in three isolates.
Among them, 12 sRNAs related to bacterial virulence are listed in Table 6.
It is of note that rliD and RatA were detected in all three isolates.
05ZYH33 the for In addition, the two Chinese isolates also had the sRNAs cspA and rli38 in common and the latter was located at the 89K GI. For the rest sRNAs, over 27% (12/44) of the novel sRNAs were involved in riboswitches (Table S4). Discussion Known virulence factors contributing to the pathogenicity of S. suis 2 Although in vitro transcriptomes do not resemble in vivo ones, this analysis nonetheless illustrated the overall expression pat- terns for all the known virulence factors of S. suis 2 during in vitro incubation.

Zhang D et al / Transcriptome Analysis of Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 273 relatively high transcription levels comparing to other viru- lence factors (Table 3). In particular, although it was previ- ously reported that inactivation of mrp is related to an increase in bacterial virulence [28], the two pathogenic strains had even higher transcription levels of mrp. Glucose metabolism in bacteria not only reﬂects their prior- ity for certain carbon sources, but also affects their virulence [29]. PTS functions as a sugar phosphorylating system and reg- ulates diverse metabolic processes that affect the expression of many genes, especially those related to bacterial virulence [30]. In Listeria monocytogenes, the depletion of the mpt operon, which encodes the EII(t)(Man) PTS permease, resulted in increased expression of ﬁve genes in the prfA virulence gene cluster [31]. In this study, we observed the downregulation of four genes of the Man family in the PTS pathway, suggesting the involvement of the PTS pathway in changing the virulence of both Chinese isolates.
Downregulation of transcriptional anti-terminators may inﬂuence the virulence of the Chinese isolates in the BgIG family or distinctive In the PTS pathway, the most signiﬁcantly downregulated gene was SSU05_1490/SSU98_1501 (BgIF). In a recent study performed in Escherichia coli, BgIF has been shown to nega- tively regulate transcriptional anti-terminator proteins of the BgIG family [32]. Both Chinese isolates just have one gene that belongs to the BgIG family, SSU05_1491/SSU98_1502, with fewer transcripts identiﬁed compared to P1/7, rather than increased as predicted.
Therefore, there may be other novel proteins regulatory mechanisms in S. suis 2, which have yet to be discovered.
Nevertheless, previous studies showed that decreased activity of the transcriptional anti-terminator proteins might change the bacterial virulence [33]. For instance, the reduction in the expression of the transcriptional anti-terminator RfaH may increase the Ag43 expression level, and thereby stimulate bioﬁlm formation [33]. The repressed transcription of SSU05_1491/SSU98_1502 indicates that some mechanism is responsible for the change in virulence in the two Chinese isolates.
Conclusion Here, we provided the ﬁrst publicly-available RNA-seq data for three S. suis 2 isolates, and we highlighted the biological processes in the two highly pathogenic isolates, providing clues for mechanistic research.
Furthermore, our detailed lists of novel protein-coding genes and sRNAs provide candidates for further functional investigations, especially in the regula- tion of bacterial virulence.
Materials and methods Bacterial culture bacterial concentrations for all strains were determined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 600 nm each 60 min (Figure S6). All isolates reached the log/exponential phase after incubation for 5 h. Transcriptome sequencing Total RNA was isolated from bacteria at log/exponential phase using the SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer s instructions.
Ribosomal RNAs were removed using the Ribo-Zeroä rRNA Removal Kit for Gram-Positive Bacteria (EPICENTRE Biotechnolo- gies, Madison, WI). Strand-speciﬁc libraries were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina GAII platform by the Genom- ics and Bioinformatics Platform at the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The raw sequencing datasets were uploaded to the NCBI SRA database (accession No: SRP043973). Read mapping The sequencing read quality was evaluated using the FastQC tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/ fastqc/), and data saturation analyses were carried out using the RSeQC software [34]. Qualiﬁed reads (quality score  20) were ﬁrst ﬁltered for ribosomal RNAs using the BWA software (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), and the rest were subsequently mapped to reference genomes of 98HAH33,05- ZYH33 and P1/7. The uniquely-mapped reads (MAPQ  20) were used for further analysis.
In addition, the sequenc- ing coverage for single nucleotide of the genome as calculated using the genomeCoverageBed in BEDTool [35]. Gene expression analysis for homologous genes Identiﬁcation of homologous genes Protein sequences were analyzed to identify homology across the three isolates by using the Inparanoid software [36] and a pair-wise analysis was also performed to identify the homology between any two strains by using the MultiParanoid software [37]. Differential gene expression Based on the gene annotations in the database, the RPKM val- ues were calculated for each gene using uniquely-mapped reads [38]. Raw read counts of genes were calculated by using HTSeq [39], BEDTools [35] and RSeQC [34]. Furthermore, DEGseq [40] was used to identify DEGs with the MARS model, with the criteria of fold change  2 and P  0.05.
Pathway analysis Candidate genes were ﬁrst mapped onto functional groups in COG Gene Oncology and KEGG pathway analyses were per- formed online using the DAVID software [41] (Fisher s exact test, P  0.05). The three S. suis 2 strains 98HAH33, 05ZYH33 and P1/7 were obtained from Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Bacteria were grown in Todd-Hewitt Broth (THB) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with 2% yeast extract (THY) at 37 C. The growth rates and Virulence factor analysis Virulence factors were extracted from the virulence factor database (VFDB) [42]. A VFs.faa ﬁle was used for local blast- ing with BLASTP (v2.2.24, using default parameter with E  274 value set as 1E 5), and the top hits were used as candidates for further analysis.
Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 266 275 Gene annotation of the S. suis 2 genome using RNA-seq data Identiﬁcation of novel TARs in intergenic regions The sequencing depth for each nucleotide was ﬁrst calculated, and a nucleotide was deﬁned to be transcriptionally-active when its sequencing depth was higher than the lower deciles of the sequencing depth in the transcriptome. Consecutive transcriptionally-active nucleotides In this study, TARs  70 bp in intergenic regions were further annotated [43]. form TARs.
Annotation of novel genes The DNA sequences for all novel TARs were blasted against NCBI Bacterial Genomes (all.ffn.tar.gz) for homology identi- ﬁcation using BLAT.
The functions of the novel TARs in three S. suis 2 isolates were annotated based on the function of their known homologous genes in other bacteria.
Identiﬁcation of sRNAs TARs without identiﬁed homologous genes were further com- pared with sRNAs in both sRNAMAP [44] using BLAT(V35) [45] and Rfam (11.0) using INFERNAL(1.1rc2) [46] to identify the potential sRNAs. Authors contributions CZ conceived the project.
