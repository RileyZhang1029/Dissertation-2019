Watson Bioinformatics Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, RG20 7NN, UK Received on November 19, 2008 revised on January 06, 2009 accepted on January 25, 2009 Advance Access publication January 29, 2009 Associate Editor: Ivo Hofacker ABSTRACT Motivation: With the increasing use of post-genomics techniques to examine a wide variety of biological systems in laboratories throughout the world, scientists are often presented with lists of genes that they must make sense of.
A consistently challenging problem is that of deﬁning co-regulated genes within those gene lists.
In recent years, microRNAs have emerged as a mechanism for regulating several cellular processes.
In this article, we report on how gene lists and microRNA targets data may be integrated to test for signiﬁcant associations between gene lists and microRNAs. Results: We discuss CORNA, a package written in R and released under the GNU GPL, which allows users to test gene lists for signiﬁcant microRNA target associations using one of three separate statistical tests, to link microRNA targets to functional annotation and to visualize quantitative data associated with those data.
Availability: CORNA is available as an R package from http://corna.sf.net Contact: xikun.wu@bbsrc.ac.uk technologies involving post-genomics 1 INTRODUCTION Experiments such as microarrays, proteomics and systems biology often present scientists with gene lists that they must attempt to make sense of.
Several software packages exist that allow scientists to assign functional annotation to gene lists, and to assign statistical signiﬁcance to those associations.
These include tools for associating genes with biological ontologies (e.g. Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) and with biological pathways (e.g. Salomonis et al., 2007). A particular challenge is that of assessing which genes in a given gene list are co-regulated.
miRBase (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006), a database of all known microRNAs, has been created and there have been several published software tools that attempt to predict the targets of microRNAs (Brennecke et al., 2005). An excel-based tool (Creighton et al., 2008) has been produced for linking microarray data to microRNA targets information.
Here we describe CORNA, a package for R that allows scientists to analyse gene lists in the context of microRNA target predictions.
Methods exist to test for signiﬁcant microRNA target relationships in gene lists, and to test for signiﬁcant associations between microRNAs and pathways and GO terms.
The software is ﬂexible and can read data from public databases or from a scientists own data ﬁles. CORNA is released as open-source under the GNU GPL. To whom correspondence should be addressed.
2 FLOW OF INFORMATION Central to the ﬂow of information through CORNA is the gene list from which the user may test for signiﬁcant microRNA target associations.
The user may also start with a microRNA, ﬁnd genes that are associated with that microRNA and then test that gene list for signiﬁcant associations with KEGG pathways or GO terms.
The user may also plot quantitative data associated with the targets of a particular microRNA. Inputs 2.1 CORNA exclusively uses R vectors and data frames.
CORNA includes functions for reading microRNA target data directly from miRBase and microRNA.org (Betel et al., 2008). There are also helper functions to read gene and GO term data using biomaRt (Durinck et al., 2005) microarray data directly from GEO (Barrett et al., 2008) and pathway data directly from KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2004). 2.2 Methods CORNA employs three complementary statistical methods for enrichments analysis of relationships within lists of genes.
These are the HyperGeometric test, Fisher s exact test and the χ 2-test.
2.3 Outputs If the user tests a gene list for signiﬁcant microRNA associations, then the output is an R data frame with one row per microRNA, the observed and expected frequencies from sample and population, and the range of user- selected P-values.
Where the user begins with a particular microRNA, the targets information is used to create a gene list and that gene list is tested for enrichment of pathways and GO terms.
There is also a range of plotting functions for plotting quantitative data associated with microRNA targets.
3 EXAMPLE ANALYSIS 3.1 Using CORNA to test for enrichment of microRNA target relationships in a gene list The list in this example, tsam, consists of 1000 ensembl transcript ids 940 of these were chosen at random, then 30 predicted targets for two microRNAs were added.
The example assumes that the ﬁle arch.v5.txt.mus_musculus.zip has been downloaded from miRBase targets.

The user may work with genes simply by converting the transcript list to microRNA gene relationships using the BioMart2df.fun and corna.map.fun functions.
3.2 Using CORNA to test for KEGG pathways associated with a microRNA list The microRNA used in this example is mmu-mir-155 , and we use the predicted targets from miRBase to test for enrichment of KEGG pathways.

We then ﬁnd those genes predicted to be targets of mmu-mir-155. The next stage is to use the KEGG2df.fun function to obtain links between genes and pathways from KEGG ID Description Expected Observation P-value 00190 Oxidative phosphorylation 5 00400 Phenylalanine etc.

Finally, we set the sample to be only those genes targeted by mmu-mir-155 that have a pathway link, and perform hypergeometric and Fisher s exact tests for the KEGG pathways involved.
The top ﬁve pathways can be seen in Table 1.
4 SUMMARY With increasing use of large-scale post-genomics techniques, scientists are often presented with lists of genes.
MicroRNAs have emerged as an important regulator of gene function.
In this article, we have shown that CORNA can be used to test for signiﬁcant associations between genes, microRNAs, pathways and GO terms.
CORNA can also be used to plot quantitative data associated with microRNA targets.
CORNA is ﬂexible and can read data from public databases or from a user s own ﬁles. CORNA has been tested on both Microsoft Windows and Red Hat Linux. CORNA is released under the GNU GPL and is available from http://corna.sf.net. Funding: BBSRC (core strategic grant of the Institute for Animal Health). Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.
