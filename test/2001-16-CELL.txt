cytoskeleton.
RhoA acts as a molecular switch that Cell 82 Fz/Dsh pathway regulates the formation of polarized cytoskeletal structure.
We report here that a RhoA effector protein, the Dro-sophila Rho-associated kinase (Drok), functions to regu-late the actin cytoskeleton downstream of Fz/Dsh.
Drok controls a subset of the PCP response: regulating the number but not the orientation of wing hairs, and the rotation but not chirality of photoreceptor clusters.
We show that the major signaling output from Drok is the phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin II regulatory light chain (MRLC) and regulation of myosin II activity.
Finally, we show that fly myosin VIIA, homolog of the human Usher Syndrome 1B and mouse shaker-1 genes, also displays strong genetic interactions with this newly de-fined Fz/Dsh cytoskeletal signaling pathway.
These data provide the first link between Fz/Dsh signaling and direct modulators of the cytoskeleton, and suggest that such a pathway is evolutionarily conserved during the devel-opment of epithelial polarity.
Results Drok as a Downstream Effector of Drosophila RhoA We have reported a multidomain protein kinase, Gek, that binds specifically to the GTP-bound form of Dro-sophila Cdc42 and may serve as an effector for Cdc42 (Luo et al., 1997).
We hypothesized that there might be additional Gek-like kinases that serve as effectors for other Rho-family GTPases.
Using degenerate PCR, we identified the Drosophila homolog of a class of mamma-lian Rho-associated kinases/ROCKs (Ishizaki et al., 1996; Leung et al., 1996; Matsui et al., 1996), which we named Drok for Drosophila Rho-associated kinase.
In the course of our studies, Mizuno et al.
(1999) have independently reported the identification of Drok.
Figure 1A depicts the domain organization of Drok in compari-son with rat ROK-b.
Both proteins are composed of a conserved N-terminal domain, a serine/threonine kinase domain, a large coiled-coil domain with an embedded Rho-binding domain, and a C-terminal Plekstrin-homol-ogy (PH) domain split by a Cys-rich domain (CRD).

A change of photoreceptor number has also been reported in eye clones homozy-Evidence that Drok Acts Downstream of fz/dsh The similarity of the Drok2 clonal phenotype in the winggous for a hypomorphic RhoA allele (Strutt et al., 1997).
Of those ommatidia with the correct number of photore-to aspects of the phenotypes of fz, dsh, and RhoA led us to hypothesize that Drok may act downstream of Fz/ceptors, 60% were misrotated (Figure 2B), whereas in control clones all ommatidia were properly rotated (Fig-Dsh.
To assess the genetic interactions among these genes, we quantified the multiple hair phenotype in aure 2A).
These phenotypes resemble those of PCP mu-tants such as fz, dsh, and RhoA (reviewed in Mlodzik, defined region, the ventral surface of the proximal-ante-rior region of the wing.1999), suggesting that Drok may also participate in the signaling cascade controlling PCP.
Unlike fz and dsh, We made use of the dsh1 allele, which is defective for PCP function without affecting Wg signaling (Axelrod ethowever, very few ommatidia showed aberrant chirality.
We also examined the function of Drok in the wing, al., 1998; Boutros et al., 1998).
In dsh1 hemizygous males, an average of 16.8 cells with multiple hairs (12%where PCP is exhibited at a single cell level (Wong and Adler, 1993).
In wild-type wings, each cell produces a of the cells) are present in this region (Figure 3A).

In contrast to the suppres-sion of the dsh1 phenotype by overexpression of Drok,to examine the F-actin distribution in Drok2 clones during prehair initiation (Figure 2E, red).
Mutant clones were reduction of Drok dosage by 50% (assuming that Drok2 Cytoskeletal Link of Polarity Signaling 85 is null) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the number of multiple hair cells (Figures 3C and 3D).
We also examined genetic interactions between Drok and fz in a different assay.
The proper level of Fz/Dsh signaling is critical for the generation of wild-type PCP, as both overexpression and loss of function of these genes result in polarity defects in the eye (Zheng et al., 1995; Strutt et al., 1997) and the wing (Krasnow and Adler, 1994).
Overexpression of Fz 30 hr after puparium formation (APF) produced primarily a multiple hair phe-notype that was suppressed by dsh1 heterozygosity (Ta-ble 1; Krasnow and Adler, 1994).
Similarly, reducing the wild-type copy number of RhoA and Drok by half sup-pressed the phenotype by 2-to 2.5-fold (Figures 3G and 3H; Table 1).
Taken together, these experiments suggest that Drok functions downstream of Fz/Dsh in restricting the number of F-actin-based prehairs.
Nonmuscle Myosin II Regulatory Light Chain: A Critical Drok Target Studies in mammalian cells have identified several downstream substrates for Rho-kinase/ROCK (Amano et al., 2000).
In particular, Rho-kinase regulates the phosphorylation of the nonmuscle myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) primarily at Ser-19 and secondarily at the adjacent Thr-18 (Amano et al., 1996; Kimura et al., 1996).
Phosphorylation of MRLC at these sites results in a conformational change that allows myosin II to form filaments and increases its actin-dependent ATPase ac-tivity (reviewed in Tan et al., 1992).
The amino acid sequence around the phosphorylation site of MRLC is highly conserved between mammalian MRLC and the Drosophila homolog, encoded by spa-ghetti squash (sqh) (Karess et al., 1991; Jordan and Ka-ress, 1997).
We therefore assessed the phosphorylation of the Drosophila MRLC using an antibody that recog-nizes mammalian MRLC only when Ser-19 is phosphory-lated (anti-phosho-MRLC; Matsumura et al., 1998).
Im-munoblot analysis showed that this antibody specifically recognizes phosphorylated Sqh in larval extracts (Figure 4A)the single z20 kDa band in wild-type extract is absent in extracts of a sqh null, or when wild-type extract is treated with phosphatase (Figure 4B).
While phos-phorylated Sqh is detectable in Drok2 mutant extracts, its level is greatly reduced (Figure 4A), whereas the Sqh protein level is not affected in Drok2 mutants (Figure 4A, lower panel).
Previous work with bovine Rho-kinase established that expression of the N-terminal catalytic domain gives rise to a constitutively active kinase Figure 4.

These observations support notype caused by Fz overexpression (Table 1).
These results support the notion that MRLC functions in thethe notion that MRLC is a key target (either directly or Cytoskeletal Link of Polarity Signaling 87 PCP pathway to restrict F-actin bundle assembly to a single site.
MRLC phosphorylation in response to Drok activation would be predicted to modify the conformation and ele-vate the catalytic activity of its associated heavy chain, Zipper (Zip) (Young et al., 1993).
We tested whether Zip also participates in regulating actin distribution/wing hair number in response to Fz/Dsh.
Loss of one copy of the zip gene enhanced the dsh1 phenotype by 4.5-fold (Figure 5A), consistent with the genetic interaction data between fz/dsh and sqh.
These results suggest that myosin II functions positively downstream of Fz/ Dsh in regulating actin prehair development.
The localization of Zip protein in wing cells further supports its role downstream of Fz/Dsh.
At the apical surface of the pupal wing cell, Zip is asymmetrically localized to the distal portion of the cell, where prehair growth initiates (Figure 5B).
This distal localization ap-pears to coincide, temporally, with prehair initiation.
To test whether Zip localization could be modified by Fz/ Figure 6.

Cell 88 pathway has been implicated in functioning downstream of RhoA in regulating ommatidial polarity (Strutt et al., 1997).
However, the function of the JNK pathway in the wing has not been described, and a signaling pathway that regulates transcription is unlikely to encode the requisite spatial information necessary for selection of the site of prehair initiation.
Therefore, it is likely that a separate signal from or upstream of RhoA may control the selection of the F-actin assembly site, and therefore the orientation of the wing hair (Figure 7).
Several other genes have been implicated in regulat-ing wing hair number based on their loss-of-function phenotypes, including inturned (in), fuzzy(fy), and multi-ple wing hair (mwh) (reviewed in Shulman et al., 1998).
We believe that these gene products participate in a distinct branch of the polarity signaling pathway for the following reasons.
First, because they each have signifi-cant effects on both hair orientation and hair number, they are unlikely to function downstream of Drok.
