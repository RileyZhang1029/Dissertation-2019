Our model extends a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model to allow data fusion on a gene- by-gene basis.
This encodes the intuition that co-expression and co-regulation are not necessarily equivalent and hence we do not expect all genes to group similarly in both datasets. In particular, it allows us to identify the subset of genes that share the same structure of transcriptional modules in both datasets. Results: We ﬁnd that by working on a gene-by-gene basis, our model functional coherence than existing methods.
By combining gene expression and transcription factor binding (ChIP-chip) data in this way, we are better able to determine the groups of genes that are most likely to represent underlying TMs. Availability: If interested in the code for the work presented in this article, please contact the authors.

is able to extract clusters with greater 1 INTRODUCTION Approaches to the elucidation of gene regulatory networks have often relied on the use of clustering methodologies, grouping genes on the basis of expression patterns over time, treatments and/or tissues.
The genes in a given cluster are usually assumed to be potentially functionally related or to be inﬂuenced by common upstream factors.
For example, Eisen et al. (1998) found that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes that clustered together did indeed often share similar biological function, and a large number of subsequent authors have found the same, sometimes even being able to verify the results experimentally (e.g. Ihmels et al., 2002). Application of these approaches to gene expression data have led to the recognition that gene regulation is often performed by regulatory programmes or transcriptional modules (TMs) sets of co-regulated genes that share a common biological function and are regulated by a common set of transcription factors.
Ihmels et al. (2002) devised a method for identifying TMs by assigning genes to clusters in a context-dependent manner.
A gene could be assigned to several clusters, resulting in overlapping TMs, a feature which is biologically meaningful since a gene could be involved in multiple biological processes.
Clustering on the basis of expression data alone, however, only indicates co-expression, and does not directly identify co-regulation.
To whom correspondence should be addressed.
The expression patterns of genes in the same cluster may be correlated for reasons other than co-regulation the effects of experimental measurement error may be important, for example.
Due to the complexity of gene regulatory networks, as well as the limitations of any given source of noisy experimental data, it is advantageous to make TM inferences using multiple sources of data.
In addition to gene expression data, a range of other data types have been used to enhance the reconstruction of gene networks.
These include information about transcription factor binding derived from experimental techniques such as ChIP-chip, sequence data and even information derived from relevant scientiﬁc literature.
Both Segal et al. (2003a) and Kundaje et al. (2005) have described methods to integrate expression and sequence data within the framework of a probabilistic graphical model, using the method of expectation maximization a statistical technique for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters from incomplete data.
Segal et al. (2003b) applied a variant of this approach to infer regulatory modules in S.cerevisiae, together with their component regulators, under the assumption that the regulators themselves are transcriptionally regulated, at least under a subset of conditions.
Bar- Joseph et al. (2003) described a method to integrate ChIP-chip and expression data based on an exhaustive iterative search over possible combinations of regulators, which identiﬁes a subset of gene targets with highly correlated expression patterns.
Dirichlet process mixture models (DPMs Antoniak, 1974 Ferguson, 1973) are a class of Bayesian non-parametric models that has been widely used for clustering (Dahl, 2006 Liu et al., 2006 Medvedovic and Sivaganesan, 2002 Medvedovic et al., 2004 Qin, 2006 Rasmussen et al., 2009 Rasmussen, 2000 Wild et al., 2002). DPMs have the interesting property that the prior probability of a new data point joining a cluster is proportional to the number of points already in that cluster, thus encoding a natural clustering tendency.
Clustering strength is controlled via a hyperparameter α, which sets the expected number of clusters as a function of the number of clustered items.
By inferring α we can therefore determine the posterior distribution of the number of clusters.
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process models [HDPMs as deﬁned by Teh et al. (2006)] are the hierarchical extension of DPMs. They consist of a DPM for each of a number of different contexts, with the mixture components for each context being drawn from a master list of mixtures from the next level of the hierarchy.
A wider range of HDPMs are reviewed in Teh and Jordan (2010). Reid et al. (2009) use a type of HDPM to identify TMs from transcription factor binding site sequence data.
Gerber et al. (2007) use HDPMs to model gene expression programs in a variety of tissues.
Effective combination of different datasets can be an effective way to identify TMs. Liu et al. (2007) introduced a HDPM that assigns a DPM to each of a pair of datasets (e.g. gene expression  The Author(s) 2010.

As we shall see below, the Liu et al. approach is a special case of the model we present in this article.
2 METHODS Our aim is to cluster genes together on the basis of both gene expression and ChIP-chip (transcription factor binding site) information.
We wish to identify the genes that possess the same clustering structure across both datasets, as these are more likely to represent underlying TMs and hence share speciﬁc biological function/s. We expect that the information coming from each dataset will be uncertain and possibly contradictory.
Therefore, we wish to distinguish (on a gene-by-gene basis) between genes that can sensibly have their data fused and those for which there is contradiction.
2.1 The model We construct our model (shown in Fig.1) from a two-level hierarchy of DPMs. This model can be regarded as a modiﬁed version of the HDPM presented in Teh et al. (2006). A naïve use of HDPMs for data integration may fail since it assumes that all data sources are clustered identically.
Our principal innovation is to include, for each gene, an indicator variable that determines whether the gene should join a cluster based on both data sources combined (via a product of likelihoods) or whether it should be clustered separately for each dataset. The genes are assigned to three contexts, each deﬁning a clustering partition via a DPM. One context contains the genes that are fused across the two datasets. The other two contexts are for the unfused genes, one clustering solely on the basis of expression data and the other using the transcription factor binding dataset. The fusion indicator variables are learnt as part of the inference process (carried out via a Gibbs sampler), allowing us to determine the posterior probability that any given gene will be fused.
We deﬁne our model as follows [using the same notation as Teh et al. (2006)]. We have n genes, for each of which we have two sets of measurements (expression and ChIP-chip). Each gene can either be considered for the two datasets separately or we can fuse them together, giving a single (product) likelihood.
This gives us three contexts overall.
Let xji be the observed response for i-th gene in the j-th context.
Note that when sampling, genes can ﬂip from a fused to unfused state and vice versa.
Each context j 1,2,3 has a countably inﬁnite number of mixture components, of which K are occupied.
Each component k 1,...,K has a mixture weight denoted by πjk and a parameter vector θjk, where the set of parameters may be different for the different contexts.
Fig.1.
Graphical representation of the model presented in this article.
The parameters are deﬁned in Section 2.
Discovering transcriptional modules Each gene is assigned to a mixture component via the indicator variable Zij, giving us the following equations.
P(Zij = k π)= πjk The conditional likelihood for each gene is then: P(xji Zij = k,θ)= Lj(xji θjk) (1) (2) where Lj is the likelihood we assign to model the data and θjk are the parameter values for mixture component k in context j.
These are assigned the stick-breaking prior associated with the Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006) πjk = Vjk (1 Vji) i k (3) where Vjk are mutually independent and Vjk Be(1,α) which we write Stick(α). Marginalizing over the mixture weights gives us a DPM for each context.
Similarly,  are the mixture weights for the second level of the Dirichlet process hierarchy.
Again, these are assigned a stick-breaking prior and marginalized over, so that they do not have to be considered explicitly in the analysis.
(cid:1) (4) (5) (6) (7) π α0 Stick(α0)  γ Stick(γ) α0 Gamma(2,4) γ Gamma(2,4) The hyperparameters α0 and γ are the concentration parameters for the two levels of the Dirichlet process hierarchy.
α0 is shared across all three contexts, representing the prior belief that they are all representing the same biological system and hence we should expect the same number of underlying TMs. These can be inferred and therefore are assigned vague gamma priors as follows.
We choose the component likelihoods to reﬂect the nature of the two datasets. For the expression data, we discretize the measured value for each gene into three levels, representing under-, over- or unchanged expression.
This is something of a simplifying assumption, but makes our analysis more robust to the non-Gaussian noise typical of gene expression data, and is an approach that has been shown to be effective (see e.g. Gerber et al., 2007 Savage et al., 2009). We therefore choose the component likelihood for the expression data to be a naïve Bayes model, constructed from a product of multinomial distributions.
For the ChIP-chip data, we have statistical (P-value) information as to whether or not a given transcription factor binds to a given gene.
By thresholding these values, we obtain sparse binary data, indicating whether binding has occurred.
We choose to model these data using a so-called bag- of-words model, e.g. a multinomial likelihood over transcription factors.
This has the advantage that only counts over genes are important, meaning that a large number of zeros in the data can be handled safely.
Note that in both cases we choose to apply (conjugate) Dirichlet priors.
(xab+βab) For the expression data, we have (cid:1) (8) (cid:1) L1(x)= βab and Na=(cid:2) a  (Ba) (Na+Ba) b xab, a is the index over features and b is the index over discrete data values.
The βab are the Dirchlet prior hyperparameters, which in this case are all set to 0.5 (the Jeffreys value). b where Ba=(cid:2)  (βab) b For the ChIP-chip data, we have L2(x)= (B) (N+B) where B=(cid:2) βa and N =(cid:2) (cid:1) a  (xa+βa) (βa) (9) a xa, and a is the index over features.
The βa are the Dirichlet prior hyperparameters, which in this case are all set to 0.5 a [11:20 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq210.tex] Page: i159 i158 i167 i159  (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) R.S.Savage et al. (the Jeffreys value). The above two equations are obtained from Equation (2) for a particular cluster k by integrating out the parameters θ. We encode the notion of data fusion for a given gene i by allowing the possibility of taking the product of likelihoods over the two datasets. So, if the likelihood parameters for contexts one and two are given by θ1i and θ2i, we have the following equations.
We introduce an extra latent variable ri for each gene with P(ri =1)= w, P(ri =0)=1 w. If ri =1 (corresponding to a fused gene) then: θi =(θ1i θ2i) F3 And if ri =0 (corresponding to an unfused gene) then: θ1i  F1 θ2i  F2 This deﬁnes three contexts.
Unlike the HDPM, we have F1 DP(α0,F(1) 0 ) F2 DP(α0,F(2) 0 ) F3 DP(α0,F0) F0(θ1,θ2) DP(γ,H) where F(j) represents the marginal distribution of θj under F0. The 0 hierarchical Dirichlet process structure allows sharing of clusters across the unfused and fused contexts.
For example, an unfused gene can be allocated to the same cluster as fused genes for gene expression but allocated to a different cluster (shared by different fused genes) for transcription factors.
We choose to ﬁx w=0.5 for the analyses in this article, representing that we have no prior knowledge of the degree to which these datasets should fuse.
We note that it is also straightforward to sample from w and we run a test of this, the results of which can be seen in Table 3.
Details of the algorithm to implement this model, in particular a Gibbs sampler, can be found in Appendix A.
2.2 Special cases of the model Our model has two special cases that are of interest and represent alternative ways of approaching data integration.
w=0 gives us the model of Liu et al. (2007). In this model, there is no direct data fusion (in the sense that all the ri =0). Instead, information is shared via a common hyperparameter, α0, between the clustering for each dataset. Each dataset is therefore clustered (almost) separately, but beneﬁting from this weak sharing of information via the hyperparameter. w=1 gives us simple data integration by taking the product of likelihoods and forcing all genes to be part of a single clustering partition.
With w=1, only the fused context is used (genes can never be unfused) and so we have a straightforward DPM with a product of likelihoods over the two datasets. 2.3 Extracting modules from the posterior samples Once we have explored the model space using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, we wish to extract useful results from the samples.
In particular, we wish to identify TMs, which in our model correspond to groups of genes that fused with high probability and that are often found in the same fused cluster.
This is a non-trivial challenge, as each MCMC sample contains a large number of parameters (mixture component labels for each gene in each of three contexts, ri for each gene, plus the global hyperparameters). We therefore require a way to summarize the results.
To do this, we choose to form a posterior similarity matrix (Fritsch and Ickstadt, 2009). From this we will extract a clustering partition, which will correspond to transcriptional modules.
The posterior similarity matrix is an (ngenes ngenes) matrix where each element gives the posterior probability i160 that a given pair of genes are found in the same cluster (and hence also in the same context). These values can be estimated simply by counting the MCMC samples in the appropriate way.
A major advantage of our model is that it identiﬁes how likely each gene is to be fused (estimated from the ri values over MCMC samples). By rejecting genes with low P(ri =1 x), we can identify more tightly deﬁned TMs. For this article, we choose to deﬁne fused as being P(ri =1 x) 0.5 (the prior value we assign to w for the full model). From the posterior similarity matrix, we extract the most likely cluster partition using the method of Fritsch and Ickstadt (2009), which minimizes a deﬁned loss function that is equivalent to maximizing the adjusted Rand index between estimated and true clustering partitions.
We note that this represents a summarization of the full results implicit in the analysis.
Some kind of compromise of this nature is inevitable, simply due to the richness of the posterior distribution of our model.
As we shall demonstrate, this approach still leads to superior results and hence biological insight.
We can also extract other useful quantities from the posterior MCMC samples.
For example, the 1D marginal distributions of the hyperparameters, the number of fused clusters and the number of fused genes are all easily determined.
2.4 Quality measures We are interested in identifying TMs with well-deﬁned biological function/s. Our quality measures should therefore reﬂect this.
We choose two measures, both using the Gene Ontology (GO) database.
The ﬁrst measure is the Biological Homogeneity Index (BHI Datta and Datta, 2006). This is a global measure of how biologically homogeneous a given clustering partition is (as measured here using GO annotations). Clusters where many genes share annotations will lead to a high BHI score and vice versa.
Perfect agreement for all GO terms (which is highly unlikely) would lead to a score of unity.
We compute error estimates of these BHI scores by performing 10 random combinations of the 20 MCMC chains (chosen via bootstrap sampling, eg. so that a given chain may be selected multiple times), ﬁnding in each case the clustering partition and hence the BHI score.
This gives us a measure of any uncertainty due to inadequate mixing of the MCMC chains.
The second measure is to ﬁnd GO terms that are over-represented in any given module, relative to the background population of genes.
We use the R package GOstats (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) to apply a hypergeometric test to each GO term in each cluster.
We apply this analysis to all GO terms in the three ontologies (cellular component, molecular function and biological process). We account for the dependent, hierarchical structure of the ontologies using the relevant option in the call to the GOstats function hyperGTest. We correct for multiple hypotheses using a Bonferroni correction.
2.5 Data We perform two different analyses in this article, in each case analysing data from S.cerevisiae. To facilitate comparison with earlier work, in both cases we use ChIP-chip data from Lee et al. (2002) to provide information on transcription factor binding activity.
This dataset contains nearly 4000 interactions between regulators and promoter regions, representing 6270 yeast genes and 106 transcriptional regulators.1 We use two different gene expression datasets in the two analyses.
The ﬁrst one (referred to subsequently as the galactose utilization data) is taken from a subset of the expression dataset of Ideker et al. (2001), which has been widely used for the validation of clustering methods (Savage et al., 2009 Yao et al., 2008 Yeung et al., 2003). These data are a series of expression 1A more extensive set of ChIP-chip data from the same laboratory was later published by Harbison et al. (2004). This use of this dataset in place of that of Lee et al. (2002) does not materially change the conclusions of this article, as illustrated in Table 3.
[11:20 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq210.tex] Page: i160 i158 i167  measurements across 20 experiments representing systematic perturbations of the yeast galactose utilization pathway.
The subset used consists of 205 genes whose expression patterns reﬂect four functional categories (biosynthesis, protein metabolism and modiﬁcation energy pathways, carbohydrate metabolism and catabolism nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism transport), based on GO annotations.
However, as Yeung et al. (2003) note, since this array data may not fully reﬂect these functional categories, these classiﬁcations should be used with caution.
For the other analysis (referred to as the cell cycle data), we use gene expression measurements of the mitotic yeast cell cycle of Cho et al. (1998), which was chosen to facilitate direct comparison with the results of Liu et al. (2007), who also analysed this data.
For this dataset, we keep only the genes that were identiﬁed as having a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, following the procedure of Liu et al. (2007). We note that there are small differences in the number of genes selected in this way (949 versus 1165 in this article), due to differences in the version of the KEGG database used.
2.6 Data processing For both expression datasets, we discretize the data into three levels.
This has two beneﬁts. First, it makes our analysis more robust to the non-Gaussian (and hence hard to model) noise distribution of the data.
Secondly, it makes the task of data modelling more straightforward.
To optimize the binning of the data, we use the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (BHC) package (Savage et al., 2009) to ﬁnd an optimized binning and assume that this will then also be reasonably optimal for this analysis.
For the ChIP-chip dataset, we follow the procedure of Lee et al. (2002) and threshold the data at a P-value of 0.001, giving us a sparse dataset where the detections are robust, at the expense of a larger proportion of false negatives (Lee et al. estimate 6 10% false positives and that about one-third of the interactions are missed). 3 RESULTS The results of each data integration analysis are rich and detailed.
In this section, we consider a number of metrics and highlight signiﬁcant aspects of the results for each dataset. For comparison, we also run clustering analyses using the BHC algorithm (Savage et al., 2009) to analyse the gene expression data alone.
This gives us a baseline result with which to compare the data integration results.
It is important to assess the convergence of any MCMC analysis.
All analyses on the galactose dataset comprise 20 MCMC chains, each of 50 000 samples (after removal of 10 000 burn-in samples). All analyses on the cell cycle data set comprise 20 MCMC chains, each of 5000 samples (after removal of 1000 burn-in samples). To speed up our subsequent analyses, we sparse sample each chain by a factor of 10. of We plots include as Supplementary Material 1D hyperparameter posterior PDFs, both overall and for each MCMC chain.
These demonstrate that the MCMC analyses are converging adequately.
We also perform Geweke convergence tests (Geweke, 1992) on the hyperparameters of each chain (α0 and γ) for the w=0.5 case.
For the galactose dataset, we ﬁnd 30 of 40 tests (20 chains, 2 hyperparameters) have a z-score 2, with a maximum outlier of 3.48.
For the cell cycle dataset, we ﬁnd 28 of 40 tests have a z-score 2, with a maximum outlier of 5.53.
We conclude that our chains are reasonably well (although not perfectly) mixed, although in both cases it is important that we combine multiple chains.
The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and run on 3 GHz cluster nodes (20 in parallel, one per MCMC chain). On the galactose Discovering transcriptional modules utilization dataset (205 genes), the code produces 500 samples per chain per hour.
On the cell cycle dataset (1165 genes), the code produces 40 samples per chain per hour.
On a larger sample of 2332 genes [from the stress data of Gasch et al. (2000)], the code produces 10 samples per chain per hour.
This scaling suggests that for large (genome-scale) datasets it may be of value to investigate (for example) fast variational methods as an alternative to MCMC. 3.1 Galactose utilization dataset In Table 1, we give the BHI scores for different analyses of the galactose utilization dataset. The outcome from our model (fused genes and w=0.5) extracts a subset of 51 genes with an overall BHI score that is 9% (3 SDs) higher than for any other method, indicating a greater degree of biological functional coherence.
We note that all methods are superior to the BHC result for expression data alone (BHI = 0.323), except for the ChIP only analyses.
Figure 2 shows the variation of the BHI with the clustering partition resulting from keeping the top n genes, as sorted by P(ri=1 x). There is a clear enriching effect on the BHI (and hence biological homogeneity) by selecting a subset of genes in this way.
In Figure 3, we show a matrix of the signiﬁcantly over-represented GO terms in each of the clusters we extract for the model (fused genes and w=0.5). Notable are the density of hits, and also the distinct block structure, which reﬂects that each cluster is tending to capture all the signiﬁcance for given GO terms.
These GO terms reﬂect the four functional categories previously identiﬁed in this data, but detailed inspection of the functional annotations of the genes in each cluster reveals a ﬁner level of biological speciﬁcity than previously identiﬁed. Cluster 1 (counted from the left) comprises four genes involved in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
Cluster 2 represents genes involved in replication and RNA processing, while Cluster 3 comprises primarily ribosomal components.
Cluster 4 comprises four hexose transporters, including at least one pseudogene, which, despite being non-functional, is nevertheless expressed.
Table 4 shows comparisons of over-represented GO terms with those obtained from the Liu method.
In general, the data fusion GO terms are more enriched, with lower P-values and, in almost all cases, a higher proportion of the genes being annotated with the term.
In Figure 4, we show the ChIP-chip data for the fused genes, sorted by cluster membership.
The structure in this plot (horizontally aligned hits) shows certain transcription factors are contributing to the data integration and, like Segal et al. (2003b), we ﬁnd that TMs are characterized by partly overlapping but distinct motif combinations.
Table 3 shows some comparison analyses carried out using the Harbison et al. (2004) ChIP data in place of that of Lee et al. While the Harbison et al. data analysis ﬁnds more fused genes (72 versus 51), the BHI scores are comparable.
We also run an analysis where we sample over w in this case, the BHI scores are marginally worse and there are fewer fused genes (56) than for the w=0.5 case.
3.2 Cell cycle dataset In Table 2, we give the BHI scores for different analyses of the cell cycle dataset. Again, our model (fused genes and w=0.5) gives the best results, although in this case the method of Liu et al. i161 [11:20 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq210.tex] Page: i161 i158 i167  R.S.Savage et al.

The fused genes are those with a posterior probability of being fused of at least 0.5.
All other genes are classed as unfused. Context-averaged similarity matrices are simply constructed by averaging the posterior similarity matrix over both contexts (i.e. datasets). This is the method used by Liu et al. For comparison, the result obtained using the BHC algorithm on the gene expression data alone is 0.323.

In all cases, selecting 100 or fewer genes leads to an increase in the BHI score.
The error bars show a distribution of randomized BHI scores where the cluster sizes and number of clusters are kept the same but gene names are drawn randomly from the 205 genes in the galactose dataset. By comparison, this gives us a measure of the enrichment of the fused gene clusters.

In all cases, the data integration provides beneﬁt over simply using gene expression data and the BHC algorithm (BHI = 0.285). In the Supplementary Material we show the posterior similarity matrix, sorted by cluster membership.
The block-diagonal structure shows the core of each cluster clearly deﬁned. In this ﬁgure, off-diagonal blocks may indicate one of two possibilities it may mean that there is uncertainty in whether a set of genes should be assigned to one of the two clusters, or it may indicate a set of genes that should really belong simultaneously to two clusters.

The results here show that the Harbison et al. data result in a greater number of fused genes, with similar overall BHI scores.
Also shown are results for a run where w is sampled using a Gibbs sampler.
This shows a small degradation over the w=0.5.case. The two clusters in question (Clusters 3 and 4, counted from the left) do indeed share common GO annotations indicating metabolic function (Fig. 3). Cell cycle regulation is a complex interplay of many different external signals and intrinsic cell states (Bähler, 2005). The cell cycle is composed of at least four phases: S, synthesis phase wherein DNA is being replicated G1, gap 1 M, mitosis where the yeast cell physically pulls chromosomes into the daughters and then separates and G2, gap 2.
The transitions between phases are critical checkpoints.
There cell division is blocked by various conditions for example, signals indicating there is DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication will block cells from going from S G1. Thus, it would be expected that there may be multiple regulatory pathways, some of which likely overlap.
In Figure 3, we show a matrix of the signiﬁcantly over-represented GO terms in each of the clusters we extract.
As with the galactose utilization dataset, there is good block structure, although in this larger dataset there are some high-level GO terms that are signiﬁcant in more than one cluster.
We identify 12 fused clusters in the data (excluding singletons). While the functional annotation of many of these correspond to those previously identiﬁed by Liu et al. (2007), there are some interesting differences.
In addition to a cluster of genes involved in methionine and cysteine biosynthesis (Cluster 9), we identify a separate cluster for arginine and glutamine biosynthesis (Cluster 3). Cluster 1 comprises mainly ribosomal proteins, but also includes metabolic genes, which may be an indication of the importance i163 [11:20 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq210.tex] Page: i163 i158 i167  R.S.Savage et al.

There is a general trend that the fused clusters are more highly GO enriched.
For example, we have highlighted in bold all the cases where a cluster from one method shows a percentage of GO enrichment (for a given term) that is at least 1.5 times higher than the other method.
Note that only GO terms appearing only in both cases are shown.

The different shades of grey show the clustering partition.
of metabolic state in cell cycle progression.
Interestingly, these include the same metabolic genes that comprise Cluster 1 in the galactose utilization dataset, suggesting that these genes represent a TM that is being co-regulated with ribosomal proteins in the cell cycle.
This also highlights the value of perturbations (as used in the galactose utilization data) as a better experimental design to uncover underlying TMs than a study involving a natural biological process, such as the cell cycle.
Cluster 7 contains several key genes associated with cell cycle regulation, as well as several genes involved with the M-phase, chromosome structure and repair.
Cluster 11 contains several genes involved in the M G2 phase transition.
4 DISCUSSION Both gene expression and ChIP-chip data contain information about the biological functions of different genes, but it is non-trivial to combine them in a sensible way, both due to their noisy nature and also because co-expression and co-regulation may not necessarily be equivalent for all genes.
Our results show that by treating data fusion on a gene- the model we present here is able to produce by-gene basis, superior extraction of functionally coherent groups of genes from a combination of gene expression and ChIP-chip data.
Our model also has special cases (given by w=0 and w=1) that produce data integration results that outperform the single dataset analyses (including a fast BHC clustering using expression data only). However, the model we present is both more ﬂexible and outperforms these special cases in both the examples we have considered in this article.
The key innovation in our model is that the data integration is treated on a gene-by-gene basis.
This allows crucial ﬂexibility because we can distinguish between genes that are likely to be fused and those that are not.
We can extract genes that are closely related on the basis of both datasets, while rejecting those that are not.
It is these genes that are most likely to represent the underlying TMs. Funding: This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/F027400/1, Life Sciences Interface). Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.
