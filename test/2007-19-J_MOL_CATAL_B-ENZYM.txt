This ligninolytic enzyme fficiently oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(III) and also exhibits Mn(II)-independent activity in the oxidation of aromatic substrates.
It was able to decolorize 7 of the 41 industrial dyes tested.
The presence of manganese in the reaction mixture did not enhance the decoloration rate, in fact for some yes the transformation rate was inhibited.
On the other hand, the presence of mediator molecules in the reaction mixture generally enhanced the ecoloration of dyes that showed low activity without mediators, while the dyes that were decolorized rapidly without mediator were unaffected y the presence of veratryl alcohol, acetosyringone or TEMPO as oxidizing mediators.
The role of tryptophan 172 on dye decoloration was nvestigated.
Chemical modification of tryptophan residues using N-bromosuccinimide drastically reduced Mn(II)-independent activity and dye ecoloration, while the Mn(II)-dependent activity was maintained.
The loss of Mn(II)-independent and decoloration activities after tryptophan odification was not reversed by the addition of mediators.
These results strongly suggest that the tryptophan 172 is involved in both mediator xidation and dye decoloration activities, and in Mn(II)-independent activity.

Introduction Since the end of the XIX century several thousands of synhetic dyes have been produced.
The world annual textile dye roduction has been estimated at 800,000 tonnes [1].
In the texile industry, it is estimated that 15% of the dyestuff is released nto wastewater effluent [2].
Synthesized dyes are designed to esist water, sunlight, sweat, some chemicals and microbial egradation.
Thus, many industrial effluents are hardly decolrized by conventional wastewater treatment processes [3,4].
In ddition, many of the industrial dyes are toxic, mutagenic or arcinogenic [5,6].
White rot fungi have been demonstrated to be good candidates or a biotechnological process for xenobiotic decontaminaion.
These ligninolytic organisms are able to metabolize a Corresponding author at: Instituto de Biotecnologa-UNAM, Av.

Their extracellular enzymatic systems, hich are involved in lignin degradation, consist mainly of xidative enzymes: laccases, lignin peroxidases (LiP) and mananese peroxidases (MnP) [10].
Both peroxidases and laccases arry out substrate oxidation by a mechanism involving free adicals, and show low substrate specificity.
These ligninolytic nzymes are directly involved in the degradation of various xenoiotic compounds, including industrial dyes.
Recently, Wesenerg et al.[11] have published an extensive review on industrial ye decoloration by ligninolytic fungi.
This review summaizes the research results and prospective use of fungi and their nzymes for the treatment of dye-containing industrial effluents.
A hybrid peroxidase, different from Phanerochaete hrysosporium lignin-and manganese-peroxidases, was first ound in active lignin-degrading strains of Pleurotus eryngii 12].
This novel hybrid enzyme, called versatile peroxidase VP), was also described in Bjerkandera sp.

Similar versatile eroxidases have also been reported in P. eryngii [1417], leurotus pulmonarius [18], Pleurotus ostreatus [19], as well s in Bjerkandera adusta [13,14,20,21].
Versatile peroxidase hows high identity with LiP (5860%) and MnP (55%) both rom P. chrysosporium [16].
The heterologous expression of P in Aspergillus nidulans confirmed the ability of this hybrid nzyme to oxidize Mn(II) and different aromatic compounds n the absence of manganese [17].
This enzyme seems to ave a long-range electron transfer pathway similar to those ostulated for LiP [18].
The spectroscopic characterization of P by EPR and electronic absorption techniques showed a rotein-centered radical in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, hich was identified as a tryptophan radical [22].
In this work, the capacity of this versatile peroxidase from.
adusta to decolorize industrial dyes is demonstrated and the ole of Trp172 on these reactions is investigated.. Materials and methods.1.
Chemicals Industrial dyes were obtained from different manufacturrs as indicated in Table 1, and under different commercial ames.
Acetosyringone, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), TEMPO 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical) and veratryl lcohol were purchased from SigmaAldrich Co. All buffer salts nd hydrogen peroxide were obtained form J.T.
Baker..2.
Protein preparation Versatile peroxidase (VP) from B. adusta UAMH 8258 was btained and purified to a single band on a Coomassie-stained lectrophoresis gel as described previously [22,23].
The puried preparation showed Reinheitzahl ratio (Rz) (A407/A280) of.5, and specific activities for manganese peroxidase (MnP) of 05 U/mg protein measured by the H2O2-dependent formation f Mn(III)malonate complex [24], and for lignin peroxidase LiP) of 7.1 U/mg protein measured as veratryl alcohol oxidaion [25].
Protein concentration was estimated by using both the ioRad protein reagent and also using an extinction coefficient t 407 nm of 77,000 M1 cm1 for the purified preparation..3.
Decoloration activity Decoloration activity was determined by measuring the ecrease of the dye absorbance at their maximum visible bsorbance wavelength.
Dye concentration in the reaction mixure was adjusted to 1.0 absorbance unit at the maximum avelength in the visible spectrum (Table 1).
Reaction mixures were prepared with 0.5 mM MnSO4 at pH 3.0 and without anganese at pH 4.0 according the optimal pH reported for esticide transformation for both conditions [26].
The reactions ere started by adding 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide and the decol i b m talysis B: Enzymatic 46 (2007) 17 ration monitored in a Beckman spectrophotometer model DU 50.
All the experiments were performed in triplicate.
The effect of three mediators, acetosyringone, veratryl lcohol and TEMPO, on dye decoloration was determined by dding different concentrations of the mediator to the reaction ixture and monitoring the dye decoloration at the maximal dye avelength.
The reactions were performed in 50 mM malonate uffer pH 4.0 and in the presence of 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide.
inetic constants were determined in a 50 mM malonate uffer pH 4.0 without manganese for Reactive black 5 595 nm = 37.0 106 M1 cm1), Reactive blue 38 620 nm = 16.4 106 M1 cm1), Reactive blue 72 665 nm = 25.1 106 M1 cm1), and Reactive violet 5 555 nm = 11.7 106 M1 cm1).
The experimental data was lotted and the constants calculated by using the EnzFitter oftware (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK)..4.
Tryptophan chemical modification The chemical modification of tryptophan residues was perormed using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), as described by pande and Witkop [27].
The effect of the extent of modification n VP activity was determined as follows, VP (25.9 M) was ixed with different molar excesses of NBS in 0.1 M sodium cetate, pH 4.0.
After 30 min of incubation at room temperaure, reactions were centrifuged and extensively dialyzed against 0 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0.
Then, both specific Mn(II)ependent and Mn(II)-independent activities were determined.
he extent of NBS modification on tryptophans was spectropho ometrically determined at 280 nm after alkalinization of the odified VP sample with 10 N NaOH [28].
Because VP contains o tyrosine, absorbance values were considered to correspond o tryptophan.
The measurements were carried out in triplicate nd expressed as percentage of the unmodified protein..
Results and discussion Forty-one industrial dyes were assayed for decoloration by urified VP from B. adusta UAMH 8258 (Table 1).
Two different eaction conditions were assayed; pH 3.0 with 0.5 mM Mn(II) nd pH 4.0 without manganese.
These conditions were reported s the optimal for lignin peroxidase-like (Mn(II)-independent ctivity) and manganese peroxidase-like (Mn(II)-dependent ctivity) reactions on pesticide [26] and polycyclic aromatic ydrocarbon [23] transformations.
Twenty-seven dyes were ecolorized at pH 4.0 without Mn(II), and only 15 were decolrized at pH 3.0 in the presence of manganese.
In general, no ignificant differences were found in most dyes in both condiions.
However, Acid black 194, Direct green 6, Reactive blue 8 and Reactive green 19 showed significantly less decoloration ate, and no decoloration activity could be detected on Acid red 1, Reactive blue 198, and Reactive red 141 in the presence of.5 mM MnSO4 at pH 3.
Control experiments showed that VP s needed as a catalyst for the decoloration.
By far the most efficient single class of microorganisms to reak down synthetic dyes are the white-rot fungi, which are ostly basidiomycetes [11].

Several works on dye decoloration ave been published using whole cultures [29,30] or using the ell-characterized lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases 31,32], laccases [33,34], and VP from B. adusta and P. eryngii 15,35].
As expected, enzymatic decoloration rate is dependent f the dye chemical structure [36,37].

As in the ase of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [23] and pesticides 26], the presence of manganese reduces the decoloration rate in ome tested dyes (Table 1).
Versatile peroxidase from B. adusta s able to bleach Reactive black 5, an azo dye which was not xidized by manganese peroxidase from P. chrysosporium, in he presence or in the absence of Mn2+ [14].
Paszczynski et al.37] found that some different substituted sulfonated azo dyes ere better oxidized in the presence of Mn(II) whereas others ere better oxidized in the absence of Mn(II).
In addition, it as been demonstrated [35] that Mn2+ acts as a noncompetitive nhibitor for the oxidation of Reactive black 5 by VP from B.

dusta, according to the presence of two substrate binding sites, ne for Mn(II) and another on the protein surface connected to he heme by long-range electron transfers [39].
A manganese-binding site has been described for mananese peroxidases (MnP) from Pleurotus, Bjerkandera and P. hrysosporium [40], and a long-range electron transfer has been roposed for organic substrate oxidations [22,41].
These two ifferent catalytic sites, one for Mn and another for veratryl alcool, have been demonstrated in VP from P. eryngii [41].
High olecular weight substrates are unable to access the heme edge nd they may be oxidized indirectly by superficial residues of he protein where the substrate electrons are conducted through n intramolecular pathway to the heme active site, as in the case f lignin peroxidase [42,43].
Two azo dyes (Reactive black 5 and Reactive violet 5) and wo phthalocyanine dyes (Reactive blue 38 and Reactive blue 2) were selected for determination of kinetic constants under n(II)-independent reactions at pH 4.
Catalytic constants (kcat) aried from 286 to 1187 min1 (Table 2).
On the other hand, ffinity constants (KM) varied only slightly for hydrogen peroxde (6.810.9 M) and more significantly, from 22 to 89 M, or the different dyes.
Versatile peroxidase from B. adusta has been named dyeeroxidase [44] because it is able to oxidize dyes directly n the absence of redox mediator.
We have been exploring he use of oxidizing mediators with this enzyme, as used or laccases [45,46].
Veratryl alcohol (the model substrate for n(II)-independent or ligninase activity), acetosyringone and EMPO were tested at different concentrations (Figs.
13).
hile the dyes showing high specific decoloration activity were, n general, unaffected by the presence of mediators, the dyes howing low activity were decolorized significantly faster when ediators were added to the reaction mixture.
This decoloration ate enhancement is dependent of the mediator concentration Figs.
13).
The maximal increments on specific decoloration ates were up to 2500% for Direct yellow 58, 2000% for Disersed red 60 and 1700% for Vat blue 7 with the presence of eratryl alcohol.
On the other hand, the decoloration rate of eactive yellow 2 increased 390% with acetosyringone, and 30% with TEMPO as mediator.
However, none of the dyes howing low decoloration rate without mediator and showing ignificant increase in the decoloration in the presence of meditor, reach the decoloration activity values of those that are apidly decolorized without oxidizing mediator.
Nevertheless, hese results show that the use of oxidizing mediators could d a D 6 R talysis B: Enzymatic 46 (2007) 17 nhance the peroxidase transformation of recalcitrant polluants, as in the case of laccases [45,47].
It is important to oint out that 13 of the 41 tested dyes, specially the disperse ype, were not decolorized by VP with or without mediator Table 1).
These recalcitrant industrial dyes are: Disperse black, Disperse blue 56, Disperse blue 73, Disperse orange 30, isperse red 1, Disperse red 72, Disperse red 161, Disperse ed 167, Disperse yellow 3, Disperse yellow 54, Solvent yelow 16, Sulfur black 1, Vat red 10, and Vat yellow 46.

Activity enhancement by acetosyringone as oxidizing mediator.
The ecoloration specific rates without mediator are considered as 100%, and they re shown in the legend of Fig.1.
A redox mediator should have three properties: (i) it should e able to be oxidized by one-electron directly from the enzyme o produce a free radical, (ii) the produced radical should be table enough to diffuse and react with the target compound, nd (iii) it should have an appropriate redox potential.
The three ediators used are chemically different.
Acetosyringone is a henolic compound, veratryl alcohol is a primary alcohol and EMPO is compound able to form amoxyl radical.
The dif erent mechanisms of oxidation mediated by several mediators ave been recently elucidated in the case of laccase [48,49].
It eems probable that for the VP-TEMPO system the dyes are oxi ized via a persistent oxoammonium ion [49], the formation of phenoxyl radical could be involved in the VP-acetosyringone ystem, and the VP oxidation of veratryl alchol produces veratryl ldehyde.

Effect of the chemical modification of tryptophan residues of versatile peroxidase on the Mn(II)-dependent and Mn(II)-independent activities.

chrysosporium were used as template.
The VP shows a typcal plant peroxidase folding and, as in the case of VP from P. ryngii, contains a binding site for Mn(II) constituted by the esidues Glu37, Glu41 and Asp183.
The existence of two diferent binding sites, one for the manganese ion and another for he dye, could contribute to the differences in the pH profiles n the presence and in the absence of manganese in the reacion media.
Manganese acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor for esticide transformation [26] and for the oxidation of azo dyes 15], showing similar values of inhibition constants for both ubstrates.
The nucleotide sequence of VP from B. adusta UAMH 8258 hows two Trp residues and no Tyr, and from the molecular odel, VP contains a surface Trp172 that is structurally and unctionally equivalent to Trp171 of lignin peroxidase from P. hrysosporium [53] and to Trp164 of versatile peroxidase VPL2 rom P. eryngii.
Compound I oxidizes this residue generating a adical which is stabilized by the coupled oxidation of a reducng substrate [21,22,54,55].
This is the opposite of Mn(II), which ransfers the electrons directly to the heme through the propinates, and Trp172 is oxidized through a long-range electron ransfer pathway as in the case of LiP [41,56].
A tryptophanyl adical also has been detected in this enzyme and seems to be unctionally analogous to LiP W171 [22,57].
In order to determine the role of tryptophan 172 in dye ecoloration, a specific chemical modification with NBS was erformed.
At a NBS/VP ratio of 9.6 only 6.8% (5.3) f tryptophans remained unmodified, the Mn(II)-dependent ctivity was unaffected 113% (11), and remarkably the n(II)-independent activity (ligninase activity) was drastically ecreased to 20.6% (1.0) (Fig.4).
These results confirm the atalytic role of Trp172 in the Mn(II)-independent activity as reviously reported for VP [22,55,57].
Four different industrial yes were selected to study the effect of chemical modificaion on tryptophans on their decoloration.
Two showing high ctivity without mediator and in which the presence of mediaor does not enhance the decoloration rate (Direct blue 199 and cid blue 185), and two showing low decoloration rate and in hich the presence of mediator significantly increase the decolration rate (Direct yellow 58 and Disperse red 60).
Table 3 hows the specific activities of unmodified and modified VP reparations on these dyes, with and without 10 mM veratryl lcohol.
The chemical modification of tryptophans significantly ecreased the enzyme capacity to decolorize the dyes showing t b f d able 3 ffect of the chemical modification of the tryptophan on the dye transformation with ye Decoloration activity (A min1 nmol1) Unmodified VP Unmodified VP + 10 mM V irect blue 199 25.6 (0.8) 22.7 (0.4) cid blue 185 13.0 (0.6) 9.2 (0.3) irect yellow 58 0.08 (0.01) 2.0 (0.02) isperse red 60 0.01 (0.00) 0.22 (0.01) RD: no reaction detected.

igh activity.
The capacity of VP to decolorize Direct blue 199 nd Acid blue 185 decreased 99% and 94%, respectively.
The ecoloration reduction was not reversed by the presence of vertryl alcohol as an oxidizing mediator.
On the other hand, for the ndustrial dyes showing low decoloration rate, tryptophan modfication also reduced the activity but to less extent, 75% and 0% for Direct yellow 58 and Disperse red 60, respectively, and o decoloration enhancement was detected in the presence of 0 mM veratryl alcohol.
These results suggest an important role or tryptophan 172 in the direct decoloration of dyes and also n the oxidation of oxidizing mediators, and thus the effect of ediators for the enhancement of dye decoloration.
Though the bsolute rate of decoloration of some dyes, even in the presence f mediators, is so low as to be of little practical use.
We can conclude so far that VP from B. adusta is able to xidize a wide range of industrial dyes.
Dye decoloration by VP oes not require manganese(II) ion, and uses hydrogen peroxde as electron acceptor.
The presence of oxidizing mediators nhances the decoloration activity of dyes showing low decolration rates, while no effect was found for dyes that are highly ecolorized in the absence of mediator.
The chemical modifica ion of the two tryptophans of the VP molecule disables it for oth dye direct oxidation and mediator oxidation.
Thus the surace Trp172 seems to be involved in VP-mediated industrial dye ecoloration, in agreement with a long-range electron transfer and without the presence of veratryl alcohol (VA) as mediator A NBS-modified VP NBS-modified VP + 10 mM VA 0.31 (0.01) NRD 0.82 (0.02) 0.47 (0.06) 0.02 (0.002) 0.12 (0.02) 0.003 (0.0005) 0.015 (0.001) ar Ca p b r A A h C C R [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ R.

As for laccases, the use of oxidizing mediators y versatile peroxidase may improve the transformation of some ecalcitrant pollutants.
