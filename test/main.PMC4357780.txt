Towards this end, we developed a web-based network tool named iBIG (stands for integrative BIol- oGy), which incorporates a variety of information on gene interaction and regulation.
The gener- ated network can be annotated with various types of information and visualized directly online.
In addition to the gene networks based on physical and pathway interactions, networks at a functional level can also be constructed.
Furthermore, a supplementary R package is provided to process microarray data and generate a list of important genes to be used as input for iBIG. To demonstrate its usefulness, we collected 54 microarrays on common human diseases including cancer, neurolog- ical disorders, infectious diseases and other common diseases.
We processed the microarray data with our R package and constructed a network of functional modules perturbed in common human diseases.
Networks at the functional level in combination with gene networks may provide new insight into the mechanism of human diseases.

Production and hosting by Elsevier networks, complex diseases are progressive transformations of the cellular network.
For heritable diseases, the network is ﬂawed at the very beginning.
For chronic complex diseases, lifelong gene and environment interaction results in dynamic adjustment and, at certain points, breakdown of the network.
Understanding the speciﬁc destruction of the network in spe- ciﬁc diseases and at speciﬁc stages is the key starting point for subsequent design of rescue or remedial strategies.
Network analysis has been increasingly utilized in interpret- ing high throughput data.
Networks can be constructed purely based on gene expression information, including transcrip- tional regulatory networks [1] and co-expression networks [2]. Networks can also be built upon prior knowledge of pro- tein protein interactions [3].

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2012.08.007  Sun J et al / iBIG, A Network Tool for Integrative Biology 167 implemented as Cytoscape plugins, including BisoGenet [3], MIMI [4] and APID2NET [5], which mainly focus on protein interactomes. Network building is also provided by web ser- vices such as STRING (http://string-db.org/). Since cellular networks consist of various types of interaction and regula- tion, networks reﬂecting this complex scenario will provide better insight into the problem in hand.
In this work, we developed a network tool iBIG (stands for integrative BIoloGy), which incorporates information on both interaction and regulation.
The main architecture consists of a client interface by HTML and JavaScript, a server-side script written in CakePHP and a MySQL database.
The network visualization is implemented based on the Cytoscape Web application programming interface (API). An important R package ArrayPro (http://lei.big.ac.cn/download/open_down- load_page) is also provided for processing of microarray data and construction of networks based on functional gene sets.
To illustrate this unique feature, an example of network per- turbation in common human diseases is provided.
Design and implementation iBIG architecture iBIG is a client-server based application following the Cake- PHP framework, a popular MVC model.
In MVC models, model (M) is used to access database and pass the result to control (C), which responds to client request and view (V) is set according to the result from control.
The three main units in MVC models include client, server and database (Figure 1). When constructing networks of functional gene sets, ArrayPro can remotely access our database.
Visualization can be used for networks generated by iBIG or other network tools.
iBIG has been extensively tested on IE8 and Firefox. Database design A unique internal gene ID is used to represent every gene and its product.
The IDs from public databases are converted to the internal gene IDs.
Our integrated database mainly consists of two parts: gene interaction and gene annotation.
The iBIG architecture Figure 1 The client, server and database correspond to view, control and model in the MVC model, respectively.
ArrayPro can access the database by RMySQL. Visualization is developed based on Cytoscape Web API. interaction data are further classiﬁed into primary interaction, secondary interaction and network regulation.
Primary inter- actions include pathway interaction, protein complex interac- tion and general protein protein interactions.
Secondary interactions include gene-gene interaction, chromosome posi- tion interaction, transcription factor-target gene interaction and kinase-target interaction.
To facilitate the understanding of regulatory relationships, the latter two together with micr- oRNA-target gene interactions form the network regulation category.
Sources of the integrated database Pathway interactions were collected from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/ kegg/) by R package KEGGSOAP (available for download- ing pathway gene information), WikiPathway (http://www. wikipathways.org/), NCI-Nature (http://pid.nci.nih.gov/), PathwayCommons [6] (this composite pathway database can be selected independently or further merged with other dat- abases), Reactome (http://www.reactome.org/) and EHMN [7]. Protein complex interactions were collected from MIPS (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/corum). Pro- tein protein interactions were collected from HPRD [8], Bio- Grid (http://thebiogrid.org/), DIP [9], MINT [10], IntAct [11] and BIND [12]. Gene-gene interactions were downloaded from BioGrid. Chromosome position interactions were collected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) of GSEA (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Tran- scription factor-target gene interactions were collected from a recent paper [13]. Kinase-target interactions were collected from PhosphoSitePlus (http://www.phosphosite.org/). Micr- oRNA-target gene interactions were collected from TarBase [14], miRecords [15] and MicroCosm [15]. The network annotation includes the following informa- tion: pathway, protein complex, chromosome position, tran- scription factor, microRNA, kinase, epigenetics-related gene, housekeeping gene, tissue-speciﬁc gene, gene ontology (GO) biological process, GO molecular function and GO cellular component.
We used the same data as in the interactions for pathway, protein complex, chromosome position, transcrip- tion factor, microRNA and kinase.
Epigenetics-related genes were collected from GO and NCBI Entrez Gene.
Housekeep- ing genes were collected from three papers [16 18]. Tissue-spe- ciﬁc genes were collected from a recent paper [17]. Data for GO biological process, molecular function and cellular compo- nent were collected from MSigDB of GSEA. Construction of gene networks Construction of a gene network consists of several steps: (1) submit a gene list with one gene per line (gene symbol and En- trez gene ID are supported) (2) select databases for primary or secondary interaction (selection of primary interactions is mandatory while second interactions are optional) (3) set the network ﬁltering strategy to reduce network complexity (4) select databases for network regulation (optional) if the user wants to know about the upstream regulators and down- stream targets and (5) choose preferred network annotation to illustrate the functions of genes in the network.
The generated network can be visualized online directly or downloaded in  168 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 166 171 XGMML format.
The online visualization facilitates the inter- active reﬁnement of the network by modifying the selections.
Construction of networks with functional gene sets ArrayPro is a supplementary R package mainly for microarray data processing, including data preprocessing, identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis and construction of networks with functional gene sets.
Networks with functional gene sets can be built by calcu- lating the correlation among selected functional gene sets.
In our recent work, ArrayPro has been applied to the investiga- tion of network perturbation in Alzheimer s disease [19]. Calculation of relationship among functional gene sets ArrayPro is an independent R package which can be downloaded from http://lei.big.ac.cn/download/open_down load_page. One of the functions of ArrayPro is to build net- works with functional gene sets instead of individual genes.
The detailed procedures are described as follows.
(1) Genes belonging to the relevant gene sets are selected.
(2) A gene interaction network is constructed based on selected types of interactions.
(3) For any pair of gene sets, such as gene sets A and B, the signiﬁcance of node overlap Pnode_overlap is calcu- lated. (4) The signiﬁcance of direct interaction between the two gene sets Pdirect is also calculated (for two gene sets, genes from one gene set may interact with genes from the other gene set.
This type of interaction is called direct interaction). (5) The combined probability of Pnode_overlap and Pdirect is calculated using Fisher s method [20]. In formula (1), Pnode_overlap is the P-value of node overlap between gene sets A and B, Pdirect is the P-value of direct interaction between gene sets A and B, and S is the score transformed from the combined probability.
The P-value of S, which follows chi-square distribution with 2k degrees of freedom (k is the total number of variables to be combined, 2 in this case), is calculated by formula (2). If the P-value of S (PS) between gene sets A and B is less than a given threshold such as 0.05, we consider the two gene sets functionally related and the Score, calculated by formula (3), is taken as the ﬁnal score for the relationship between the two gene sets.
S ¼ 2ðlogðPnode overlapÞ þ logðPdirectÞÞ S  v2 Score ¼ logðPsÞ ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ 2k Network visualization Standalone network tools such as Cytoscape [21] and VisANT [22] have been developed for the visualization of biological net- works.
Recently, a web-based visualization tool Cytoscape Web [23] has been developed, which uses ﬂash technologies and provides a javascript API for developers.
Implementation of our visualization tool is based on Cytoscape Web 0.7.4 re- lease with the goal of mimicking the standalone Cytoscape. This convenient visualization tool (Figure 2) can be indepen- dently http://lei.big.ac.cn/visualization/start_ accessed at Figure 2 Visualization interface A.

The functional network was constructed by ArrayPro based on the HPRD database.
Interactions with P  0.01 were considered signiﬁcant. Case study Construction of a network for common human diseases Microarray datasets were downloaded from NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) and EBI ArrayExpress. Fifty-four microarray datasets were used in this study, including 12 for cancer, 7 for neurological disorders, 29 for infectious and inﬂammatory diseases and 6 for metabolic diseases.
Micro- array data preprocessing, differential expression identiﬁcation, enrichment analysis and construction of functional networks were all performed with ArrayPro. The microarray raw data (CEL ﬁles) was preprocessed with the GCRMA algorithm to get the expression values for every probe.
Any probe sets with a call value of less than 10% returned by mas5calls function in affy package were removed.
Then, probe sets were mapped to Entrez Gene ID.
Any probe sets not mapped to known genes were also removed from further analysis.
If there are multiple probe sets mapped to the same gene, we averaged their expres- sion values as the expression of the gene.
Differential expres- sional genes were identiﬁed by the FC-based RankProd algorithm.
Enrichment analysis was based on gene sets includ- ing EHMN, KEGG, NCI and GO from GSEA. For every dis- ease group, 60 functional terms (gene sets) were selected according to the enrichment score.
A total of 240 functional terms from the four disease groups were merged together, Network perturbation in common human diseases One of the unique features of iBIG is the construction of net- works with functional modules.
This feature can facilitate the understanding of the investigated biological problem at a high- er level compared to gene networks.
In our recent work, we have used this functionality in the investigation of pathogene- sis of Alzheimer s disease [19]. Here we demonstrate this func- tionality by constructing a functional network perturbed in common human diseases.
The most signiﬁcantly perturbed functional modules in each of the four classes of diseases were selected and merged together.
The connectivity among this set of 117 functional modules was calculated again by ArrayPro and the network was thus constructed ( Figure 3). Here we brieﬂy describe the relevance of this network to the mechanism of human diseases.
Many of the uniquely-perturbed functions in a speciﬁc dis- ease class are consistent with the current knowledge.
For example, cell cycle, DNA replication and p53 pathway (KEGG) are perturbed only in cancer, while transmission of nerve impulse, synaptic transmission, nervous system develop- ment, long term potentiation, long term depression, axon guid- ance and gap junction are perturbed only in neurologic diseases.
Therefore, other uniquely-perturbed functions may also play important roles in the speciﬁc class of diseases.

170 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 166 171 cancer, lipid metabolism and protein processing in endoplas- mic reticulum (ER) are two of the less-known factors.
Lipid metabolism is involved in membrane formation and energy production which are both critical for cell proliferation [24]. Cell proliferation will also have a different demand on the pro- tein folding and recycling in ER.
For neurologic diseases, more attention may be paid to calcium signaling, insulin signaling and HIF1alpha transcriptional regulation.
Calcium signaling is of great importance to the maintenance of normal neuro- logic activities.
Insulin signaling is involved in nutrient sensing and adjustment of cellular activity [25,26]. HIF1alpha tran- scriptional regulation is involved in oxygen sensing and cell fate decisions.
In our recent work, we have proposed that the cause of Alzheimer s disease is the prolonged low supply of oxygen and nutrients in the brain [19]. For infectious dis- eases, the unique perturbation of ribonucleoprotein complexes is of particular interest.
The signiﬁcant perturbation of this functional module likely reﬂects the enhanced translational activity in the ribosome. On the other hand, some functional modules are per- turbed in three classes of diseases but not in the fourth class.
For example, the extracellular region and cell adhesion mol- ecules are not signiﬁcantly perturbed in infectious diseases, consistent with the transcriptome measurement on blood for this class of disease which lacks tight cellular connection as in other tissues [27]. The non-signiﬁcant perturbation of the complement and coagulation cascade is a little surpris- ing. The complement and coagulation cascade is involved in immune response and blood clotting [28]. Up-regulation of this functional module is only observed in Tuberculosis (data not shown), leading to overall non-signiﬁcant pertur- bation in this disease class.
The non-signiﬁcant perturbation of the AP1 transcriptional network in infectious disease may also deserve further investigation.
AP1 functions in many cellular activities including cell cycle proliferation and apop- tosis [29]. The dysregulation of the AP1 transcriptional net- work has been reported in cancer and neurological diseases, while its connection with infectious diseases has rarely been reported.
For cancer, the ribosome is not signiﬁcantly per- turbed. This may indicate non-signiﬁcant overall perturba- tion of the signiﬁcant dysregulation of cell cycle.
For neurologic dis- eases, CMYC pathway and antigen processing and present- ing are not signiﬁcantly perturbed.
CMYC is involved in apoptosis under certain conditions, but this may not be rel- evant to neurologic disorders.
Antigen processing and pre- senting is involved in the immune response process.
The lack of signiﬁcant perturbation of this functional module may indicate a non-signiﬁcant immune response in neuro- logic diseases.
An interesting observation is the lack of func- tional modules signiﬁcantly perturbed in three disease classes but not in metabolic diseases, likely due to the less consis- tent and speciﬁc perturbation among metabolic diseases.
in cancer despite translational activity In addition, hidden links between a pair of disease classes can be revealed on this network.
Cancer and neurological diseases shared signiﬁcant perturbation of the integrin family cell surface interaction and focal adhesion.
This integrin-fo- cal adhesion axis is involved in cell proliferation and apop- tosis, which are prominent features of the two disease classes [30]. Cancer and infectious diseases shared signiﬁcant pertur- bation of endocytosis. Endocytosis is an important defense mechanism against pathogens.
It has also been found that endocytosis is involved in other functions including a variety of signaling events [31]. Neurological diseases and infectious diseases shared signiﬁcant perturbation on energy metabo- lism related functional modules including mitochondria and TCA cycle.
This may reﬂect the special energy requirement in these two disease classes.
In addition, cancer and meta- bolic diseases shared signiﬁcant perturbation of receptor activity and receptor binding.
Neurologic diseases and meta- bolic diseases shared signiﬁcant perturbation of hormone mediated signaling pathways including glucocorticoid recep- tor signaling pathway and androgen mediated signaling.
Infectious diseases and metabolic diseases shared signiﬁcant perturbation of translation related functional modules.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of metabolic diseases, it is not immediately clear how those intersections are related to the disease mechanism.
Network analysis has been widely applied to the investiga- tion of human disease mechanisms.
In most of the studies, the major focus is on the gene network.
Here we provide the func- tional network as a complementary view of the studied biolog- ical problem.
Gene networks can provide detailed information on gene gene interaction and regulation, while functional net- works can provide a global view of the cellular transformation.
The combination of these two types of networks will provide more comprehensive understanding of the studied problem including the disease mechanism.
Currently we are applying this strategy to the in-depth investigation of cancer and Alzhei- mer s disease.
Conclusion In summary, iBIG is a new tool for network construction and visualization.
Distinct features include classiﬁcation of interactions, web-based visualization and networks of func- tional gene sets.
The web-based visualization provides a con- venient way interactively.
Future development of iBIG will include integrating more func- tional data and further improvement the network visualiza- tion.
