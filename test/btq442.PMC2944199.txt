BIOINFORMATICS APPLICATIONS NOTE Vol.26 no.19 2010, pages 2496 2497 doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq442 Databases and ontologies The CoFactor database: organic cofactors in enzyme catalysis Julia D. Fischer , Gemma L. Holliday and Janet M. Thornton Advance Access publication August 2, 2010 EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, UK Associate Editor: Jonathan Wren ABSTRACT Motivation: Organic enzyme cofactors are involved in many enzyme reactions.
Therefore, the analysis of cofactors is crucial to gain a better understanding of enzyme catalysis.
To aid this, we have created the CoFactor database.
Results: CoFactor provides a web interface to access hand-curated data extracted from the literature on organic enzyme cofactors in biocatalysis, as well as automatically collected information.
CoFactor includes information on the conformational and solvent accessibility variation of the enzyme-bound cofactors, as well as mechanistic and structural information about the hosting enzymes.
Availability: The database is publicly available and can be accessed at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/CoFactor Contact: julia.ﬁscher@ebi.ac.uk Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Received on June 29, 2010 revised on July 23, 2010 accepted on July 27, 2010 1 INTRODUCTION Enzymes are proteins that catalyze the repertoire of chemical reactions found in nature, and as such are vitally important molecules.
They are generally composed of the 20 common amino acid residues, but many also require small molecules in addition for the catalysis to occur.
In some cases, these molecules are involved in regulation or in ensuring the correct folding remote from the active site.
However, many are termed cofactors, as they are required in the active site and are directly involved in catalysis.
These cofactors may be either metal ions, whose involvement in catalysis we handle in Metal-MACiE (Andreini et al., 2009), or small organic molecules, which are described here.
In both cases, these cofactors extend and enhance the basic catalytic toolkit of enzymes.
To date, there has been little collation of information on organic cofactors and their functions outside of the primary literature.
CoFactor has been designed to remedy this, as MACiE (Holliday et al., 2007) and Metal-MACiE were designed to collate data on enzyme mechanisms and metal ions in catalysis, respectively.

For each cofactor, the web site provides: (1) Overview page hand-curated information, mostly from primary literature.
This includes general information about the molecule, its chemical properties, and about pathways where appropriate.
(2) Mechanism (if available in MACiE) in the standard curly arrow representation of organic chemistry and an optional textual description.
(3) Enzymes and domains enzyme information is integrated with associated 3D structures from PDBe, PDBsum, (Laskowski, 2009), CATH domains (Orengo et al., 1997), MACiE enzyme mechanism, proteins that have been assigned this E.C. number according to Uniprot (Consortium, 2008), as well as a reference that documents the provenance of the information.

(b) Solvent accessibility displays the average atomic solvent accessibility and its standard deviation for each HET code (PDB identiﬁer for non-amino acid molecules) associated with this cofactor. 2 DATA CONTENT The CoFactor database contains 27 entries for organic enzyme cofactors (see Supplementary Table S1). On the index page, the user can choose which cofactor entry to view.

3 METHODS The data collection process used to populate the database is summarized in Figure 1.
All X-ray and NMR structures in the PDBe biological assemblies database (Boutselakis et al., 2003), which contain a HET group assigned to a cofactor, have been used for the superposition and solvent accessibility calculations.
All instances of one cofactor HET group have been superimposed on a  The Author(s) 2010.

All mechanisms have been visually inspected and all substrates and products have been abstracted to be reduced to the essential bonds that are involved in the reaction mechanism catalyzed by this cofactor. 4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The CoFactor database provides an overview for each organic enzyme cofactor. It integrates information on the organic compounds with protein structures, domains, sequences, enzyme reactions and mechanisms.
These data can be used to learn about the tasks of cofactors in biocatalysis and an analysis of cofactor properties, structure and function is in progress (Fischer, J.D. et al., submitted for publication). Most of the cofactors have been known for many years, with very few recent discoveries.
Therefore, we do not expect that this data resource will require major changes in the future.

NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993) was applied to compute the solvent accessibility of each atom a in each cofactor twice: ﬁrst for the biological assembly (SAbiolAssembly(a)) and second for the cofactor alone SAcofactorAlone(a). The relative solvent accessibility of each atom a RSA(a) has been calculated as shown in below.
