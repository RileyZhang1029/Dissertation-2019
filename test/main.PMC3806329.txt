These nAChRs are involved in nicotine dependence, mood disorders, neurodegeneration and the interactions between a4b2-containing neuroprotection. However, our understanding of (a4b2*) nAChRs and other proteins remains limited.
In this study, we identiﬁed proteins that inter- act with a4b2* nAChRs in a gene-dose dependent pattern by immunopurifying b2* nAChRs from mice that differ in a4 and b2 subunit expression and performing proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). Reduced expression of either the a4 or the b2 subunit results in a correlated decline in the expression of a number of putative interacting proteins.
We identiﬁed 208 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with these nAChRs. Furthermore, stratiﬁed lin- ear regression analysis indicated that levels of 17 proteins was correlated signiﬁcantly with expres- sion of a4b2 nAChRs, including proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and calcium * Corresponding author.

These ﬁndings represent the ﬁrst application of quantitative proteomics to produce a b2* nAChR interactome and describe a novel technique used to discover potential targets for pharma- cological manipulation of a4b2 nAChRs and their downstream signaling mechanisms.
Introduction Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are in- volved in a wide variety of functions in the central nervous sys- tem (CNS) and are disrupted in several psychiatric and neurological disorders.
The most abundant high-afﬁnity nAC- hRs in the mammalian CNS contain the a4 and b2 subunits [1 3] and this receptor subtype represents an important target for studies of functionally relevant protein protein interactions.
Heteromeric a4b2* nAChRs (where \ denotes other, poten- tially unidentiﬁed, subunits) bind nicotine with high afﬁnity [4,5] and are targeted by pharmacotherapies for smoking ces- sation [6], Alzheimer s disease [7], Parkinson s disease [8], mood disorders [9] and attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [10]. A better understanding of the nAChR signaling complex could lead to a better drug design to achieve desired therapeutic effects.
A number of studies have elucidated regulatory mechanisms that modulate nAChR function and cellular trafﬁcking. The interaction of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins with a4 subunit affects the stoichiometry and agonist sensitivity of a4b2 nAChRs [11,12]. Interactions with the calcium-sensor protein VILIP-1 af- fect the agonist sensitivity and assembly of a4* nAChRs [13]. Phosphorylation of a4 subunit by protein kinase A (PKA) affects association with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins and regulate a4b2 nAChR assembly [12,14]. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) and dephosphorylation by the phosphatase calcineurin al- ter the transition of a4b2 nAChRs into and out of functionally desensitized states following prolonged exposure to agonists [15 17]. Although these studies, and others, have identiﬁed pro- tein protein interactions with a4b2 nAChRs, our knowledge of the receptor interactome remains incomplete.
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis allows simultaneous identiﬁcation of multiple proteins present in varying quantities in complex mixtures.
The ability of MS to obtain accurate peptide sequences, and subsequently identify proteins from these detected unique sequences using protein databases, has been a signiﬁcant technological advance provid- ing high-throughput accurate protein proﬁling (see [18,19] for review). A set of proteins that appear to be associated with b2* nAChRs were identiﬁed previously by analyzing proteins iso- lated from the mouse brain tissue using a b2-selective mono- clonal antibody (mAb270) and MS with matrix-assisted laser desorption and tandem time-of-ﬂight (MALDI ToF-ToF) fol- lowed by comparison to complexes in b2 subunit null-mutant mice [20]. This study demonstrated the utility of MS to detect nAChR-interacting proteins from the brain tissue.
However, no quantitative methods have been employed to address spec- iﬁcity of the interaction between the identiﬁed proteins and the b2* nAChRs, as well as their partner subunits. Stable isotopic labeling in cell culture (SILAC) has been used to identify highly speciﬁc protein protein interactions.
Selective protein was knocked down via siRNA in cultured cells grown in standard media, in comparison with cells grown in media supplemented with  heavy  amino acids [21,22]. However, this technique is limited by its capacity to compare only two samples, and stable isotopic labeling is not currently feasible for tissue homogenates. In contrast, label-free based quantitative MS is performed sequentially and thus introduces run-to-run variations in peptide elution, preventing accurate quantitation between sample sets.
In order to facilitate identi- ﬁcation of nAChR-interacting proteins with high conﬁdence, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) [23]. iTRAQ reduces variation by labeling multiple protein samples and mixing these samples together prior to liquid chromatog- raphy tandem MS (LC MS/MS) analysis, enabling identiﬁca- tion and quantitation of multiple proteins from several samples concurrently [24]. In this study, we combined the iTRAQ technique with the use of a4 and b2 nAChR subunit null-mutant mouse lines (these null-mutants express no functional a4b2 nAChRs [4,25] and heterozygotes express intermediate levels [26]). A b2 subunit speciﬁc monoclonal antibody was used to isolate the receptors and quantify gene dose-dependent changes in the a4b2* nAChR interactome. The ability of iTRAQ to mul- tiplex all six genotypes in a single LC MS/MS experiment is essential for the quantitative identiﬁcation and comparison of interacting proteins across genotypes. This integrated strat- egy recapitulates powerful cell-based techniques, but capital- izes on the ability of iTRAQ to label multiple ex vivo tissue samples.
This technique identiﬁed a group of proteins that are associated linearly with mature nAChRs expressed in the mammalian brain and provided a platform for exploring func- tional relevance of this interactome. Results Characterizing quantitative mAb295-M270 solid phase immunodepletion of b2* nAChRs from mouse brain We ﬁrst generated mAb295-coupled M270 Dynabeads using 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 lg of mAb295/mg of M270 beads in order to determine the optimal concentration of beads as well as the optimal ratio of bead suspension to brain extracts for quanti- tative immunoprecipitation of b2* nAChRs. Increasing vol- umes (0, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 ll) of bead suspension from each concentration of mAb295 were used to capture b2* nAChRs labeled with 1 nM [3H]-epibatidine. Brain samples of three C57BL/6 mice were solubilized. After centri- fugation, supernatants were pooled, and 100 ll aliquots were used in triplicate for each concentration of mAb295 across all eight bead volumes to measure the efﬁciency and extent of [3H]-epibatidine binding site capture.
Depletion of [3H]-epi- batidine binding from mouse brain extracts by immobilized mAb295 was saturable and nearly complete across all four concentrations of mAb295 tested (Figure S1A). The ½ maxi- mal bead volume for nAChR capture decreased with increas- ing concentrations of mAb295 (R2 = 0.83 Figure S1B), but the calculated maximal binding site capture was not signiﬁ- cantly different across the four mAb295-M270 bead ratios  McClure-Begley TD et al / Quantitative Nicotinic Receptor Proteomics 209 (F(3, 11) = 1.23, P = 0.36). This suggests that the amount of mAb295 coupled to the magnetic beads is more important for efﬁcient capture of b2* nAChRs than the total available surface area of the beads themselves.
Therefore, under the con- ditions outlined in this experiment, steric hindrance of protein complexes adhering to the nAChRs was not likely to affect the ability of the mAb295-M270 beads to trap solubilized b2* nAChRs and their associated protein complexes from brain ex- tracts effectively.
Calculated parameters for speciﬁc capture of [3H]-epibatidine binding sites by mAb295-M270 beads are pre- sented in Table S1. Immunopuriﬁcation of b2* nAChRs from brain tissue of a4 or b2 subunit transgenic mice Using optimal conditions (5 lg mAb295/mg M270 beads bead volume 10% of total extracts), we extracted b2* nAChRs from mouse brain extracts prepared from wild type (WT), heterozy- gous (HET) and homozygous (KO) mice lacking either a4 or b2 nAChR subunit. There was a gene dose-dependent effect on the number of total [3H]-epibatidine binding sites in brain detergent extracts (Table 1) across genotypes. There was no signiﬁcant binding site capture from brains of a4 KO or b2 KO mice.
No signiﬁcant difference was detected in the percent- age of binding sites captured from tissue samples of WT and HET a4 (79.6  5.4 vs 83.1  7.5% n = 3, P = 0.72, t-test) or b2 (79.3  0.9 vs 78.8  1.3% n = 3, P = 0.78, t-test), indicating that immobilized mAb295 performed similarly in all samples regardless of nAChR protein content.
Measurement of relative expression of nAChR subunit proteins by iTRAQ and LC MS/MS Quantitation of iTRAQ measured abundance is expressed as the log2 of the ratio of mean reporter ion peak areas (log2MRI- PA) of all proteins present in all samples relative to the average WT abundance of the b2 nAChR subunit (the target of the IP). Since a4 and b2 nAChR subunit levels vary with gene dose, we evaluated their levels in each sample to judge the ability of iTRAQ to quantify proteins in immunocaptured eluates. Although [3H]-epibatidine binding sites varied with a4 and b2 genotypes, total protein eluted following immunoprecipita- tion (IP) did not differ signiﬁcantly across genotypes (F(5, 17) = 2.52, P = 0.09). However, log2MRIPA ratio of b2 nAChR subunit was signiﬁcantly affected by nAChR subunit knockout in a gene dose-dependent fashion (mean log2MRI- PA  SEM a4 WT: 0.12  0.17, HET: 0.31  0.16, KO: 0.94  0.23 F(2, 8) = 7.39, P = 0.024 one-way ANOVA. b2 WT: 0.19  0.23, HET: 0.60  0.31, KO: 1.53  0.19 F(2, 8) = 8.35, P = 0.018 one-way ANOVA). However, although the log2MRIPA ratio for a4 subunit was signiﬁcantly affected by a4 subunit knockout in a gene dose-dependent fashion (mean log2MRIPA  SEM WT: 0.09  0.25, HET: 0.46  0.39, KO: 1.44  0.05 F(2, 8) = 9.34, P = 0.014 one-way ANOVA), such alteration was not obviously observed in b2 subunit knockout mice (WT: 0.21  0.33, HET: 0.42  0.23, KO: 1.40  0.43 F(2, 8) = 3.27, P = 0.1 1). Log2MRIPA was correlated positively with [3H]-epibatidine binding sites captured by immobilized mAb295 for both a4 (R2 = 0.80, P  0.0009) (R2 = 0.65, P  0.0009), indicating that log2MRIPA ratio for each sub- unit is a reliable measure of the assembled nAChRs in each sample.
The data for a4 and b2 WT, HET and KO mice appear as three distinct groupings along the regression line (Figure 2). one-way ANOVA Figure subunit and b2 It should be noted that the log2MRIPA ratio measures the relative abundance of labeled peptides using a control sample as a reference.
In fact, peptides that uniquely identify b2 and a4 nAChR subunits were detected in the subunit KO brain tis- sue, despite the lack of [3H]-epibatidine binding.
These data are consistent with the fact that neither b2 nor a4 knockout completely abolishes the entire extracellular domain of the b2 nAChR subunit that is speciﬁcally recognized by mAb295 [4,25]. Thus, although these nAChR subunit knockouts com- pletely eliminate nicotinic agonist binding sites and functional nAChRs, a small amount of a non-functional protein appears to be produced that is able to form some complexes with inter- acting proteins.
Deﬁning and stratifying an a4b2* nAChR interactome by multiple linear regression following iTRAQ LC MS/MS We performed multiple linear regression on the positively iden- tiﬁed proteins in the three biological replicates to identify highly speciﬁc interacting peptides whose relative abundance changes proportionally with the amount of quantitated nAC- hRs.
Included proteins were identiﬁed by more than one signif- icant and unique peptide (peptide expectation score 1.7, corresponding to a conﬁdence interval of 95%) in at least one biological replicate.
There were 208 proteins identiﬁed by LC MS/MS acquired, iTRAQ labeled peptides, with linear correlation coefﬁcients ranging from +1 for b2 nAChR sub- unit to 0.847 for vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) (Table S2). Identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant a4b2* interacting proteins We did not fractionate tissue prior to processing, which max- imized b2* nAChR content, but also introduced proteins from irrelevant cellular compartments that formed complexes with the immunopuriﬁed nAChRs.

The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) [27] was therefore used to cull proteins from the list when the assigned cellular compartment did not corre- spond to sites of known nAChR localization.
Exceptions were made in the case of two transcription factors: Pur-a, which has the capacity to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus [28], and 3 (THRAP3), which we previously identiﬁed in an additional unpublished nAChR interactome study.
Additional analysis focused only on 91 proteins in these compartments, with 62 identiﬁed as cytoplasmic, 26 associated with the plasma mem- brane and the remaining 3 proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus/endomembrane system (Table 2). Of these, only 17 proteins (11 cytoplasmic and 6 associated with the plasma membrane) showed statistically signiﬁcant correlation with levels of the b2 nAChR subunit (Table 3). Classiﬁcation of these 17 proteins with PANTHER Gene Ontology (GO) of molecular function [29] revealed distinct biological activity proﬁles (Table 3). In the primary (unﬁltered) dataset, distribution of correla- tion coefﬁcients for b2 log2MRIPA was distinctly bimodal, with a major mode occurring between 0 and 0.5, and a minor mode occurring between 0.25 and 0.75 (Figure 3A). These data suggest that this dataset represents two sets of events: proteins that likely interacted with the antibody complex when it was not occupied by nAChRs (r  0) and proteins that interacted selectively with the immunoprecipitated nAChRs (r  0.25). In the secondary dataset, adjustment for cellular compartment eliminated the events with r  0 and resulted in a unimodal distribution approximately equivalent to the minor mode with r  0.25 (Figure 3B). These data suggest that eliminating the group of proteins that are not co-localized with the nAChRs in these cellular compartments also screens out the majority of proteins that interact non-speciﬁcally with the antibody complex.
The tertiary dataset (selected for signiﬁcant positive correlation with b2 nAChR subunit expression P  0.05) was also unimodal, with the majority of the distribution cen- tered between 0.5 and 0.75 (Figure 3C). Eliminating proteins based on cellular compartments favored identiﬁcation of more positive correlations with b2 nAChR subunit abundance.
Such result is consistent with the observation that calculated kurto- sis for the frequency distribution increased from an estimate of 0.513 to 1.211 when moving from the primary to secondary dataset, an indication that the selected datasets deviated signif- icantly from chance.
Indeed, all three frequency distributions were signiﬁcantly different from a normal distribution accord- ing to Shapiro Wilk test (P = 0.006, 0.021 and 0.022 for pri- mary, secondary and tertiary dataset, respectively), indicating that the samples were substantially enriched for a particular target protein and the associated proteins identiﬁed were lar- gely non-random.
Discussion This study used quantitative protein identiﬁcation with iTRAQ and LC MS/MS to identify protein protein interac- tions for a4b2 nAChRs. A highly speciﬁc monoclonal anti- body was used to capture b2* nAChRs reliably and efﬁciently from detergent extracts of mouse brain homoge- nates, facilitating the identiﬁcation of a set of putative nAChR-interacting proteins.
Proteins of particular interest Figure 1 Gene dose-dependent effects of nAChR subunit gene deletion on the relative protein abundance of a4 and b2 subunits The relative abundance of a4 and b2 nAChR subunits determined by iTRAQ quantitation of the log2 mean reporter ion peak areas (log2MRIPA) is signiﬁcantly altered as measured by an overall ANOVA by the full or partial gene deletion of either subunit (a4: n = 9, F(2, 8) = 7.39, P = 0.024 b2: n = 9, F(2, 8) = 8.35, P = 0.018). Gene dose-dependent decreases in abundance dem- onstrate the interdependence of a4 and b2 nAChR subunits in mouse brain.

tend to follow a linear trend with respect to the measured quantity of a4b2* nAChRs that are present in the samples from WT, HET and KO mice trans- genic for the a4 or b2 subunit. The log2MRIPA ratios (trans- formed representation of average protein abundance measured by iTRAQ) of the individual a4 and b2 nAChR subunit proteins were signiﬁcantly correlated with the measured [3H]- epibatidine binding sites, supporting the accuracy and repro- ducibility of iTRAQ-coupled LC MS/MS. Previous studies have shown that expression of a4 nAChR subunits is largely dependent on that of b2 subunit however, low levels of b2* nAChRs remain in the absence of a4 [26,30]. Additional a sub- units (a2, a3 and a6) are expressed in the CNS and can form functional nAChRs together with b2 subunits [31]. Although the non-a4 nAChRs are not sufﬁciently abundant to allow identiﬁcation of these complexes from the whole brain lysate by iTRAQ. Our measurements of a4 and b2 nAChR subunit peptides across the six genotypes using iTRAQ are consistent with published studies on the effect of subunit null-mutation on mature b2* nAChR subtype expression.
Importantly, our measures indicate that in the absence of a partner subunit, individual nAChR subunit monomers contributing to hetero- meric a4b2* nAChRs are not apparent, and that multi-subunit complexes are required to prevent rapid degradation of free subunits. nAChR peptides have been recognized previously by mAbs in knockout mouse tissue [30]. The genomic DNA encoding the majority of the extracellular domain of the b2 nAChR sub- unit (recognized by mAb295) is not removed by exon deletion, through which the a4 and b2 nAChR subunit knockout mice were generated [4,25], so identiﬁcation of low levels of a4 and b2 nAChR subunit peptides in their respective KO mice is not surprising.
It is also possible that some of the peptides recovered in the a4 and b2 KO samples are incorrectly identi- ﬁed as a result of chimeric spectra in MS/MS that do not actu- ally represent nAChR subunit peptides however, chimeric spectra generally result in uncertainty of protein identiﬁcation, rather than positive identiﬁcation of peptides that are not actu- ally present in the sample [32]. It is possible that truncated nAChR subunit peptides in KO tissue cannot form binding sites but retain some features of nascent nAChR assembly intermediates, since measurable [3H]-epibatidine binding sites decreased in gene-dose-depen- dent fashion following nAChR subunit deletion, while the amount of total eluted protein following mAb295 afﬁnity puri- ﬁcation did not change.
In addition, when comparing func- tions of proteins identiﬁed in the dataset adjusted for improper cellular compartment to those in the dataset adjusted for correlation with b2 nAChR subunit expression, proteins serving chaperone isomerase, and ER-Golgi transport func- tions are lost.
Therefore, proteins captured from detergent ex- tracts of KO brain homogenates that do not follow the regression trend likely represent proteins that are associated with incomplete/immature b2* nAChRs, while the more strongly and signiﬁcantly correlated proteins potentially inter- act with mature receptors.
Proteins negatively correlated with nAChR subunit levels may be involved in degradation and/or compartmentalization of non-functional nAChR proteins, or  Table 3 Proteins with their abundances signiﬁcantly positively correlated with that of b2 nAChR subunit across genotypes Correlation coeﬃcient N F score P value Protein UniProtKB accession No.Cellular compartment Previously identiﬁed  Molecular function 0.748 0.858 1 0.652 0.645 0.637 0.917 0.57 0.562 0.665 0.539 0.519 0.856 0.512 0.506 0.502 0.493 12 18 18 18 18 18 20.268 44.542   11.844 11.404 10.904 0 0 0 0.003 0.004 0.004 18 21.235 0.01 7.681 7.386 0.014 0.015 7.933 0.018 6.563 0.021 5.884 0.027 18 18 12 18 18 6 18 18 18 18 P03995 O70174 Q9ERK7 P08551 Q99JY9 P11798 Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein nAChR subunit a4 nAChR subunit b2 Neuroﬁlament light poly peptide Actin-related protein 3 Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit a Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit c F-actin-capping protein subunit a2 Thyroid hormone receptor- associated protein 3 Transcriptional activator protein Pur-a P42669 P47754 Q569Z6 Q923T9 Cytoplasm Cell junction Cell junction Growth cone Cytoplasm Cytoplasm Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane Cytoplasm Nucleus Nucleus Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 6 Spectrin b chain, brain 1 11.009 5.695 5.496 5.378 5.149 Ras-related protein Rap-1A Myosin-10 0.029 0.03 0.032 Myelin proteolipid protein 0.034 0.037 Spectrin a chain, brain Tubulin b-3 chain Q8BGN3 Cell membrane Q62261 Cytoplasm P62835 Q61879 P60202 P16546 Q9ERD7 Cell membrane Cytoplasm Cell membrane Cytoplasm Cytoplasm No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No Yes No Protein binding, structural molecule Neuro-transmitter receptor Neuro-transmitter receptor Protein binding, structural molecule Nucleotide binding, protein binding Transferase, nucleotide binding, protein binding Transferase, nucleotide binding, protein binding Protein binding Nucleotide binding, protein binding Nucleic acid binding, translation regulator, protein binding Catalytic activity, hydrolase activity Protein binding, lipid binding, structural molecule activity Hydrolase activity, protein binding, nucleotide binding Protein binding, nucleotide binding, hydrolase Structural molecular, protein binding Hydrolase, protein binding, nucleotide binding Hydrolase, nucleotide binding, structural molecular, protein binding, peptide M c C l u r e - B e g l e y T D e t a l / Q u a n t i t a t i v e N i c o t i n i c R e c e p t o r P r o t e o m i c s 2 1 3  214 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 207 218 Frequency distribution of correlations for proteins associated with b2 subunit Figure 3 Frequency distribution of calculated correlations between relative abundances of putative interacting proteins and b2 nAChR log2MRIPA was shown.
A.
The primary dataset (no protein exclusion) is bimodal, indicating the presence of a substantial number of proteins identiﬁed with no signiﬁcant correlation or a negative correlation.
B.
The major (negative correlation) mode is lost when identiﬁed proteins in cellular compartments that do not normally contain nAChRs are removed (secondary dataset), resulting in a skewed distribution.
C. The tertiary dataset (signiﬁcantly correlated proteins) is also predictably skewed, indicating that the edited dataset favors proteins that are enriched for the b2 nAChR subunit. may bind to mAb295 and accumulate in the absence of bound nAChRs. The use of iTRAQ coupled with a4 and b2 nAChR subunit transgenic mouse tissue provides a signiﬁcant technical ad- vance over previous proteomic methods used to identify spe- ciﬁc nAChR-interacting proteins.
Separating samples with difference in gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and eliminating bands/spots that appear in the KO control condition prior to LC MS/MS pose the risk of missing signiﬁcantly-associated proteins that are expressed in low abundance and may co-mi- grate with non-speciﬁcally captured proteins [33]. Mulitplexing with iTRAQ and identifying as many proteins as possible in the post-IP eluent reduce the risk of missing proteins of interest due to preprocessing steps like DIGE, but increase the risk of identifying proteins that are not necessarily associated with assembled a4b2* nAChRs. Combining SILAC with siRNA- mediated knockdown reduces identiﬁcation of false interacting proteins, which is not suited to tissue samples and is limited to a direct comparison of two samples [22]. To address this issue, we took advantage of quantitation using iTRAQ to generate linear regression of the apparent abundance of each identiﬁed protein together with that of the b2 nAChR subunit across the six genotypes examined in each sample set, allowing us to iden- tify a continuum of protein associations, ranging from highly positive to highly negative correlations.
Previously suggested nAChR-interacting proteins were lost from the dataset as our analysis became more stringent.
Eight (out of 17 in total) of a4b2 nAChR-interacting proteins iden- tiﬁed by MALDI ToF-ToF [20] are retained when identiﬁed proteins are restricted by cellular compartments, and 1 (out of 17) is identiﬁed when only proteins whose expression were signiﬁcantly correlated with b2 nAChR subunit expression lev- els were considered, suggesting that these previous analyses may have suffered from missed identiﬁcation and potentially false positive interactions.
The current method, in contrast to MALDI ToF-ToF [20], identiﬁed a signiﬁcant correlation be- tween the relative abundance of a4 nAChR subunit and the abundance of its primary partner b2 (r = 0.858). It is impor- tant to note that proteins listed in a recent comprehensive re- view (2011) [34] include those whose interactions are inferred from modulatory interactions (as with protein kinases and phosphatases which are known to phosphorylate or dephos- phorylate the nAChRs). Such interactions are transient and may be cell-type speciﬁc. Therefore, future studies using en- riched samples from a particular brain region and/or neuronal phenotype will be required to validate such associations.
Interpretation of interacting proteins that are not likely to interact in functionally relevant ways with target proteins is a caveat in current proteomic methods.
This highlights the need to curate results of these analyses carefully and is part of the tradeoff for enhanced discovery and unbiased identiﬁca- tion of novel interacting proteins.
Examining the relative sub- cellular distribution of identiﬁed proteins in each of the lists generated by increasingly stringent criteria provided some interesting insights.
Culling proteins by cellular compartment resulted in a dataset of 91 identiﬁed proteins in which 68% were cytoplasmic.
Some Golgi/ER membrane resident proteins were also identiﬁed, indicating that the list of 91 interacting proteins likely includes proteins that interact with b2* nAChRs during assembly or maturation.
The relative subcellular distri- bution of nAChRs in neurons in vivo is unknown, but cell sur- face expression of a4b2* nAChRs varies both by brain region and model organism [35,36]. The list of 17 proteins whose expression is correlated signiﬁcantly with that of b2 nAChR subunit eliminates the Golgi/ER resident proteins, suggesting that this group represents proteins that largely interact with mature nAChRs present in the plasma membrane.
Interactions with other plasma-membrane resident proteins are likely dis- rupted following solubilization. This is reﬂected in the list of 91 interacting proteins, where the majority (65%) are cytoplas- mic proteins, indicating that in the mature state, the large cytoplasmic loop of each subunit that resides between trans- membrane domains 3 and 4 represents the primary site for intracellular protein protein interactions.
Establishing molecular function classiﬁcations with PAN- THER pathway analysis [29] reveals that the primary interac- tions of mature b2* nAChRs occur with structural proteins that are part of, and regulate the growth and assembly of, the cytoskeleton. These data are consistent with studies show- ing that b2* nAChRs are involved in production and mainte- nance of dendritic spines during development [37]. Of particular interest are the cytoskeletal proteins that appear to  McClure-Begley TD et al / Quantitative Nicotinic Receptor Proteomics 215 play functional roles in the growth and reorganization of syn- aptic processes, such as actin-related protein 3 (Arp3) and F- actin capping protein subunit a2. Arp3 contributes directly to axon branching [38] and is implicated in strain differences in hippocampal information processing [39]. Activity-depen- dent accumulation of F-actin capping proteins occurs in den- dritic spines [40], supporting the idea that b2* nAChRs play a role in dynamic neuronal cytoarchitecture remodeling and providing a potential molecular mechanism for future evaluation.
Two isoforms of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a and c, were identiﬁed in the current experiment.
CamKII is involved in nAChR recycling [41] and a-kinase-anchoring protein (aKAP, a CaMKII anchor- ing protein) inhibits proteasomal degradation of muscle-type nAChRs [42]. CaMKII is also a critical mediator of long- term potentiation (LTP) (see [43] for review), a molecular mechanism underlying memory storage.
CaMKIIa is specif- ically associated with the postsynaptic density in excitatory neurons (see [44] for review) and previous studies have dem- onstrated that acute nicotine exposure in mice activates CaMKII in the spinal cord and brain, which requires activa- tion of b2* nAChRs [45,46]. In addition, b2* nAChR-medi- ated activation of CaMKII is an essential component of the antinociceptive effects of nicotine [47] and affective signs of nicotine withdrawal [48]. Chronic nicotine exposure results in an increase in CaMKIIa expression and function in nu- cleus accumbens of mice and this effect is attenuated follow- ing administration of a b2 nAChR selective antagonist [49]. Nicotine also inﬂuences several aspects of hippocampal- dependent learning [50]. Identiﬁcation here of a direct asso- ciation between a4b2* nAChRs and CaMKIIa provides rationale for role in hippocampal plasticity.
future studies of its It should be noted that glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is one of the most highly correlated proteins identi- ﬁed in the curated list of proteins.
Homomeric a7 nAChRs have been reported to be expressed on astrocytes [51]. How- ever evidence of a4b2 nAChR expression on non-neuronal CNS cells is lacking.
Identiﬁcation of GFAP in this study may imply that a4b2* nAChRs could participate in neu- ron glia interactions.
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed a novel set of nAChR- interacting proteins that are consistent with known nAChR- mediated functions, as well as previously identiﬁed interactors such as spectrin-a, validating our methodology.
In addition to these biological ﬁndings, development of the iTRAQ tech- nique in combination with evaluation in knockout mouse lines will be important for identifying protein protein interac- tion without prior knowledge of the complex and for identi- fying interactions that cannot be detected using traditional protein an nAChR-associated proteome also provides a set of novel tar- gets for drug discovery of therapeutics for smoking cessation and psychiatric or neurological disorders associated with nic- otinic dysfunction.
Ultimately, generation of small molecules that are capable of disrupting or facilitating interactions be- tween nAChRs and speciﬁc associated proteins holds the promise of providing more targeted therapies with higher selectivity for particular nAChR-mediated behavioral func- tions and fewer side effects.
Identiﬁcation of identiﬁcation techniques.
Materials and methods Chemicals Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). [3H]-epibatidine (62.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer, Sheldon, CT. iTRAQ reagents were obtained from AB Sciex (Framingham, MA). Animals Homozygous wild type (WT), heterozygous (HET) and homo- zygous (KO) mice lacking either a4 or b2 nAChR subunit were used in the study.
b2 nAChR subunit [4] and a4 nAChR sub- unit [25] knockout (KO) mice were backcrossed at least 30 gen- erations to a C57 BL/6 background.
Mice were bred at the University of Colorado, Boulder, housed in groups of no more than 5 individuals per cage, maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle and given ad libitum access to food and water.
All proto- cols involving animals were approved by the Institutional Ani- mal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Yale University and the University of Colorado and conformed to the stan- dards for animal care and use set by the National Institutes of Health.
Preparation of brain tissue extracts for immunoprecipitation solution (PBS, pH 7.4  Animals were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation and brains were rapidly placed on an ice-cold surface.
After rinsed in chilled phosphate buffer containing 136.9 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 10.14 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.76 mM KH2PO4) to carefully wash off any debris, brains were then snap frozen by immersion in 35 C isopentane and kept frozen at 80 C until use.
On the day of tissue prep- aration, brains were thawed on a chilled surface and cerebel- lum was removed and discarded.
The resulting tissue (whole forebrain) was homogenized by hand with 37 strokes in a glass tissue grinder in 10 volumes of extraction buffer (EB) (0.6% Triton X-100, 121.9 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 10.14 mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1.0 mM PMSF and 10 lg/ml each of aprotonin, prepstatin A and leupeptin pH 7.4). The resulting homogenate was incubated at 23 C with gentle rota- tion for 30 min to facilitate protein solubilization, then sub- jected to centrifugation for 20 min at 5000 g, 4 C. The resulting supernatant was used for all subsequent experiments.
[3H]-Epibatidine binding from mouse brain extracts Measurement of the amount of high-afﬁnity nAChRs in brain extracts was performed essentially as described previously [52], except that 1 nM [3H]-epibatidine was used as the radioligand instead of 200 pM [125I]-epibatidine. [3H]-epibatidine labeled nAChRs were captured by ﬁltration through a Packard Filter- mate 196 Cell Harvester (Meriden, CT) onto Pall type A/D ﬁl- ters pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethylinimine. After washing three times with ice-cold wash buffer (140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM KCl,.7H2O, 25 mM HEPES, pH 2.0 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgSO4 7.5), radioactivity on individual ﬁlters was measured by liquid  216 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 207 218 scintillation counting on a Beckmann LS6000LL (Indianapo- lis, IN) at 55% efﬁciency. Immunoprecipitation mAb295 has been previously characterized as an antibody spe- ciﬁc to b2* nAChRs [1]. A solid phase mAb295 immunopuriﬁ- cation matrix was prepared using M270 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s instructions and stored in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3 at 4 C until use.
On the day of IP, bead suspensions were aliquoted, separated on a magnetic stand, and rinsed once with PBS prior to the addition of brain supernatant. IP took place overnight at 4 C with gentle rotation.
Following IP, beads were separated with a magnetic stand and the super- natant was aspirated and discarded.
Beads were then rinsed twice with PBS containing 0.01% Tween-20, then again in PBS only.
Proteins were eluted from rinsed beads with 500 ll elution buffer (0.5 M NH4OH and 0.5 mM EDTA) by incuba- tion at 23 C for 20 min with gentle rotation.
Elution was re- peated one more time.
The resulting eluate was then combined and lyophilized in a Speedvac DNA120 overnight.
The lyophilized proteins were used for subsequent proteomic analysis.
iTRAQ labeling and protein identiﬁcation by LC MS/MS All samples were prepared for iTRAQ analysis using a CHCl3/ MeOH precipitation after diluting each to 100 ll with water.
400 ll of MeoH was then added and vortexed extensively prior to the addition of 100 ll CHCl3. An additional 300 ll of water was added prior to vortexing and centrifuging at 14,000g for 1 min.
The top aqueous layer was removed and discarded and an additional 400 ll MeOH was added.
After a 2 min cen- trifugation at 14,000 g, the MeOH was removed without dis- turbing the pellet.
The pellet was dried in a Speedvac and dissolved in 50 ll of 0.5 M tetraethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 0.2% SDS. Table S3 lists the amount of each sample used per sample set for labeling which was determined based on a nanodrop measurement at A280versus a buffer blank.
Disulﬁde reduction was performed by incubating with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at 60 C for 1 h. Alkylation was then performed by incubating with 20 mM methylmethanethiolsulfonate (MMTS) at room tem- perature for 10 min.
Samples were digested using a 1:10 weight/weight ratio protein/trypsin and incubating at 37 C for 16 h. Each dried iTRAQ label was dissolved in 50 ll of 100% isopropanol. Reporter ion tags and sample identiﬁca- tions are listed in Table S3. After vortexing, each reconstituted iTRAQ reagent was transferred to the appropriate vial and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. At this point, the tagged sample digests were mixed together in each indicated set.
100 lg of sample mixture was then passed over a cation ex- change cartridge (AB Sciex) to remove unreacted reagent.
The sample was diluted with 2 mL of 10 mM KH2PO4/25% aceto- nitrile (ACN) (pH 3.0) prior to passing over the cation ex- change cartridge (conditioned with 10 mM KH2PO4/ 25% ACN, pH 3.0). The cartridge was then washed with 1 mL of the same buffer prior to eluting the peptides with 500 ll 10 mM KH2PO4, 25% ACN, 350 mM KCl (pH 3.0). The sam- ples were dried, dissolved in 20 ll 70% formic acid (FA) and diluted with 300 ll 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA), prior to desalting using a Macrospin C18 (The Nest Group, # SMM SS18V). The bound peptides were eluted with 360 ll of 80% ACN containing 0.1% TFA and the elution was repeated by washing with an additional 180 ll of same solution.
Samples were dried in a Speedvac and dissolved in 3 ll FA mixed with 8 ll 0.1% TFA. and uses a Waters Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an AB Sciex TripleTOF 5600 which is equipped with a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system, Symmetry C18 180 lm  20 mm trap column and a 1.7 lm, 75 lm  150 mm nanoAcquity UPLC column (45 C) for peptide separation with the following multiplexed groups: Set 1 with 6 plex con- taining a4WT1, a4HET1, a4KO1, b2WT1, b2HET1 and b2KO1 Set 2 with 6 plex containing a4WT2, a4HET2, a4KO2, b2WT2, b2HET2 and b2KO2, and Set 3 with 6 plex containing a4WT3, a4HET3, a4KO3, b2WT3, b2HET3 and b2KO3. Trapping was done at 15 ll/min, 99% Buffer A (99.9% water and 0.1% FA) for 1 min.
Peptide separation was per- formed at 500 nl/min with Buffer A and Buffer B (99.925% and 0.075% FA). The gradient was 99% A at initial conditions with a linear gradient to 35% B at 160 min, and 95% B at 160.3 min.
Protein identiﬁcation and iTRAQ quantitation was performed using AB SCIEX ProteinPilot ver 4.2, which employs a Paragon algorithm with hybrid sequence tag and feature probability database searches [53]. Hence, speciﬁc de- tails such as mass tolerances, speciﬁc modiﬁcations, etc.
are not used.
All iTRAQ results were uploaded into the Yale pro- tein expression database (YPED http://yped.med.yale.edu/ repository/) [54]. Data analysis Ligand binding and immunoprecipitation Ligand binding results were transformed from counts per min- ute (CPM) to fmol of bound ligand for all quantitations. To determine the maximally effective ratio of mAb bead volume for quantitative immunoprecipitation, the average depletion of nicotinic binding sites relative to the input was calculated using a 3-component hyperbolic equation y = y0 + a(x)/ [b + (x)], where  y  is bound ligand captured with residual binding  y0 , maximal depletion  a  at ½ maximal [bead]  b  and [mAb]  x.
Curve ﬁts were performed with the above- mentioned equation in SigmaPlot 2001.
Statistical signiﬁcance of the inﬂuence of genotype and/or antibody capture efﬁciency was determined by Student s t-test or a one-way ANOVA (when comparing two or more groups, respectively) conducted with SPSS19 with a conﬁdence interval set at 95%. iTRAQ data analysis For relative quantitation of proteins identiﬁed by LC MS/MS, the quantiﬁed proteins should have a conﬁdence interval for positive identiﬁcation greater than 95% with at least two un- ique peptides contributing to the identiﬁcation. The reporter ion peak areas for each peptide measured were averaged for each protein identiﬁed in every group to provide an MRIPA. A control mean for every identiﬁed protein was generated by averaging the MRIPA for the two nAChR wild type control animals (a4WT and b2WT). All samples within a set were di- vided by these control means in order to calculate the ratios of  McClure-Begley TD et al / Quantitative Nicotinic Receptor Proteomics 217 MRIPA in relative to an averaged control set.
The ratio of each identiﬁed protein to the level of nAChR proteins was then log2 transformed and used to measure the relative quantitative expression.
Except where indicated, log2MRIPA was used in all statistical analyses of iTRAQ data within this study.
For regression analysis across biological replicates, log2MRIPA of each protein was correlated with that of the b2 nAChR sub- unit.
Regression and correlation analysis was conducted using SPSS 19 with a conﬁdence interval set at 95%. The frequency distribution of identiﬁed proteins was interrogated using the Shapiro Wilk test of normality with a conﬁdence interval set at 95%.
