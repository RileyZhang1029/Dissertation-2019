Elevated cAMP in NF1 over-expression flies and cAMP feeding did not alter fly body weights.
a. NF1 over-expressing flies showed higher cAMP concentrations than controls (*: P < 0.02), from 4 experiments of 25 male and 25 female flies per experiment, total of 200 flies per genotype.
b. Dietary supplementation of cAMP did not affect body weight.
Male and female w 1118 flies were fed regular food containing 0 M, 1 M and 10 M dibutyryl-cAMP until 45 days of age.
Groups of 10 flies per treatment were weighted.
n = 4, average weight per fly SD.
