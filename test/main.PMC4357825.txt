This has received much attention in recent years since it may offer us a promising donor cell source for cell transplantation therapy.
There has been great progress in iPS cell research in the past few years.
However, several issues need to be further addressed in the near future before the clinical application of iPS cells, like the immunogenicity of iPS cells, the variability of differentiation potential and most importantly tumor formation of the iPS derivative cells.
Here, we review recent progress in research into the pluripotency of iPS cells.
Introduction Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be derived from mouse somatic cells via the ectopic expression of four deﬁned factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (also known as Yama- naka factors) [1]. The mouse iPS cells express pluripotency markers and both X chromosomes are reactivated, allowing differentiation into various cell types of three germ layers when injected into a blastocyst. iPS technology makes reprogram- ming much easier [2,3] in comparison to early reprogramming methods such as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) [4,5], iPS technology also circumvents the ethical problems arising from the use of human oocytes.

Production and hosting by Elsevier patient-speciﬁc iPS cells could be used to screen new drugs [6,7]. However, there are currently several limitations in apply- ing iPS cells clinically.
Efﬁciency of converting somatic cells to iPS cells is still very low.
In particular, only approximately 0.1% to 1% of somatic cells experience changes at the tran- scriptional level and ﬁnally become pluripotent stem cells when non-integration approaches are used [8]. Moreover, compared to embryonic stem (ES) cells, the developmental potential and differentiation capacity of iPS cells is signiﬁcantly reduced and there is increased variability among all iPS cell lines [9]. In mice, only small proportions of these cells are fully repro- grammed based on the most stringent tetraploid complementa- tion assay for evaluating pluripotency [10 13]. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a strict molecular standard system to dis- tinguish fully reprogrammed iPS cells from those partially reprogrammed, as we currently lack suitable in vivo pluripoten- cy tests for human iPS cells.
In this review, we mainly focus on recent progress on ro- dent, non-human primate and human iPS cells, and point out some key questions which need to be addressed in the near future, such as the pluripotency level of human iPS cells and 1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

Generation of non-integration iPS cells Takahashi and Yamanaka reprogrammed mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts by the ectopic expression of four reprogramming factors using retroviral vectors, and ﬁnally produced iPS cells which resemble ES cells [1]. This original iPS reprogramming approach used viral vectors, including retrovirus and lentivirus which possess high reprogramming efﬁciency [14,15]. The gen- ome may be mutated by integrating other gene sequences, thus raising concerns on the safety issue.
In addition, the insertion of oncogenes, like c-Myc, increases the risk of tumor forma- tion [16,17]. Subsequently, several modiﬁed methods were used to obtain much safer iPS cells, for instance, piggyBac transpo- son [18], adenovirus [19], sendai virus [20], plasmid [21], epi- somal vectors [22] and minicircle vectors [23]. However, the reprogramming efﬁciency is signiﬁcantly decreased and it takes longer to reactivate the key pluripotency markers to achieve full reprogramming.
Therefore, efﬁcient generation of non- integrated iPS cells by new approaches may promote their clin- ical application.
Recent studies have described several reprogramming methods using proteins, RNAs and small-molecule com- pounds to derive safe iPS cells [24 26]. Zhou et al. obtained iPS cells induced by recombination of the proteins of the four Yamanaka factors obtained by fusing the C-terminus of the proteins with poly-arginine (11R) [24]. A recent study reported that mouse and human iPS cells can be efﬁciently generated by miRNA mediated reprogramming [25]. Miyoshi et al. [26] suc- cessfully generated iPS cells by direct transfection of human somatic cells using mature miRNA. iPS cells can also be gen- erated by synthetic RNAs, which bypass the innate response to viruses [27]. Recently, Houet et al. [28] showed that pluripotent stem cells can be generated from mouse somatic cells at an efﬁ- ciency of 0.2% by using a combination of seven small-molecule compounds.
Compared to traditional viral methods, the afore- mentioned approaches can be used to generate qualiﬁed iPS cells (Table 1) without the risk of insertional mutagenesis. Nonetheless, some familiar drawbacks exist, such as a longer and less efﬁcient reprogramming process.
In other words, what we need to do next is to optimize non-integration induction systems in order to resolve these drawbacks.
The pluripotency of mouse iPS cells Pluripotency of mouse ES and iPS cells can be detected by a series of testing standards.
These standards include the expres- sion of pluripotency markers, alkaline phosphatase (AP) stain- ing, teratoma formation in vitro, the formation of diploid chimera, and tetraploid complementation. The ﬁrst-generation of iPS cells resemble ES cells in morphology and express some pluripotency markers, but are not able to produce live chimeric mice [1], indicating that the original iPS cells were not fully reprogrammed to pluripotent stem cells.
Subsequently, modi- ﬁed protocols were used for reprogramming to create im- proved qualiﬁed iPS cells, which resulted in the generation of live chimeric mice with germline transmission [16,29]. Whether fully reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells have the ability to generate iPS-mice through tetraploid comple- mentation has been questioned for a long time until 2009, when live pups were ﬁnally generated in two independent research laboratories no matter reprogrammed by one or three factors [30,31], using adult or fetal cells [13,32], the iPS cells are able to generate iPS-mice, even after genetic modiﬁcation. [12,13]. Since then, However, not all mouse iPS cells are able to pass the most rigorous tetraploid complementation assessment.
Therefore it is important to identify molecular markers which can predict the pluripotency level of iPS cells, which will help future mech- anistic studies.
A small number of transcriptionally active genes within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster on chromo- some 12qF1, particularly Glt2 and Rian, are aberrantly Table 1 Summary of different reprogramming methods for the generation of iPS cells Viral or nonviral Type of vector Genomic integration Advantages Disadvantages Viral Retrovirus Lentivirus Adenovirus Sendai virus Yes Yes No* No** Stably integrated into the host genome high eﬃciency Reduces the risk of transgene expression high eﬃciency Lacking viral integration high eﬃciency Lacking viral integration high eﬃciency Too risky because of their insertional tendencies cause tumor formation Too risky because of their insertional tendencies Tend to carry the virus genome Tend to carry the virus genome Nonviral piggyBac transposon No*** Plasmid No* Episomal vector Minicircle vector Protein RNA Small molecule No* No* No No No Virus-free Virus-free no integration of the plasmid into the host genome Virus-free a single transfection Virus-free higher transfection eﬃciency Longer ectopic expression Virus-free Virus-free high eﬃciency Virus-free A labor-intensive process Lower eﬃciency four rounds of transfection Lower eﬃciency Lower eﬃciency Labor-intensive procedures Lower eﬃciency Ref [1,16] [14] [19] [20] [18] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25 27] [28] Note: * Lack of genomic integration can be examined ** lack of virus RNA genome can be examined *** transposon vector can be removed from the genome.
Feng C et al / Pluripotency of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells 301 silenced in most iPS cell lines.
These iPS cell lines poorly con- tribute to chimeras and fail to support the development of iPS cell-derived embryos generated by tetraploid complementation [33,34]. In contrast, in fully pluripotent iPS cell lines these genes are expressed at levels comparable to those in embryonic stem cells.
The pluripotency of human iPS cells Human iPS cells produced via somatic cell reprogramming have opened up another new territory for regenerative medi- cine.
Human iPS cells generated from adult human ﬁbroblasts express hES cell-speciﬁc surface antigens, including SSEA-3, SSEA-4, tumor-related antigen (TRA)-1 60, TRA-1 81 and NANOG protein, while displaying high telomerase activity and multiple differentiation potential [35 37]. In addition, human iPS cells can differentiate into cells of all three germ layers.
However, unlike the mouse situation, there are no suit- able in vivo testing standards for human ES/iPS cells available that can be applied to test the in vivo functions in embryonic development and pluripotency. As a result, the failure to dis- tinguish pluripotent cell lines will hinder clinical application in the future (Table 2). The pluripotency of naı ve iPS cells Pluripotency can be deﬁned as the ability of a single cell to dif- ferentiate into all types of somatic cells in an adult organism.
Rodent pluripotent stem cells can be considered to exist in two distinct states: naı ve and primed [38]. Rodent naı ve plurip- otent stem cells can be derived through expansion of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst, the reprogramming of so- matic cells, or the reversion of primed pluripotent cells.
Ro- dent primed pluripotent stem cells can be accessed through harvesting the post-implantation epiblast or pre-implantation blastocyst [39 41]. Naı ve and primed iPS cells have some com- mon characteristics: indeﬁnite self-renewal, tri-germ layer dif- ferentiation potential and reliance on the core transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. However, naı ve pluripotent stem cells are distinguished from primed cells in that they rely mainly on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling and MEK/GSK3 inhibition to maintain their self-renewal, two ac- tive X chromosomes in female cells and pluripotency to gener- ate high-grade chimeras, even tetraploid complementation animal [11,42 44]. Primed pluripotent stem cells, however, de- pend on the Activin-nodal signaling pathway.
They generate chimeric mice with low efﬁciency and fail to contribute to the germline of chimeric mice [40]. Human embryonic stem cells are derived from pre-implan- tation blastocysts and more closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells in pluripotency level, when compared with rodent counterparts [45]. In fact, several attempts to capture human naı ve pluripotent stem cells have been carried out.
Naı ve-like female human ES cells (with two active X chromosomes) were derived in 5% oxygen and conventional human ES culture conditions containing bFGF [46]. NANOG-positive cells can be harvested from human pre-implantation embryos and maintained in vitro at physiological oxygen concentrations when supplemented with FGF inhibitor or 2i, which is used to stabilize naı ve rat ES cells.
This suggests that some transient naive cells may exist in early human embryos [47,48]. Though we have witnessed exciting progress in the ﬁeld of naı ve human pluripotent stem cells research, deﬁnitive evidence for naı ve Table 2 Pluripotency levels of ES/iPS cells vary among different species Cell type Species Pluripotency markers AP staining Teratoma formation Diploid chimera/germline Tetraploid complementation Ref ES/iPS ES/iPS ES/iPS ES/iPS Note: n indicates that chimera assay cannot be used in human ES/iPS pluripotency test.

Although repro- gramming mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast using the four Yama- naka factors in mouse ES culture medium yields naı ve mouse iPS cells, similar endeavor in reprogramming human embryonic ﬁbroblasts by applying naı ve culture condition gen- erates human iPS cell lines that lack characteristic qualities seen in bona ﬁde mouse ES/iPS cells [1,15]. This suggests a crit- ical question: whether human naı ve-speciﬁc pluripotent stem cells can feature characteristics seen in rodent cell lines.
Non-human primate ES cells and iPS cells share very simi- lar characteristics with regard to pluripotency markers, gene expression and ability to differentiate into all three germ layers [49,50]. The chimera assay can be used to distinguish primed and naı ve rodent pluripotent stem cells, which cannot be used on human cells.
Non-human primate cells may be the most ideal substitute to test the rodent paradigm (Figure 1). Similar to mouse primed stem cells (epiblast stem cells), a report shows that rhesus monkey ES cells cannot produce high-grade chime- ric embryos or blastocysts [51], although ES cells can be ob- served in the ICM of blastocyst transiently when introduced to four-cell stage embryos.
These results suggest that non-hu- man primate embryonic stem cells are therefore primed stem cells.
Primates, as the model animal most similar to human, can be used for chimera arrays to screen Naı ve pluripotent stem cells.
Additionally, development of new methods to func- tionally evaluate non-human pluripotent stem cells, such as by establishing a fetal chimera array, may help to evaluate the pluripotency level of human pluripotent stem cells in the future.
