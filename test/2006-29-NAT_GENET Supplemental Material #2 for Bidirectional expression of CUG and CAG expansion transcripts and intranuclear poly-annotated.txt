SCA8 intranuclear inclusions/ pan-nuclear staining are also found by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody (MW5) raised against the recombinant protein derived from polyglutamine domain of the DRPLA protein.
Similar to the findings of 1C2 immunostaining, intranuclear inclusions in Purkinje cells were confirmed in BAC-Exp (a) but not in BAC-Ctl animals (b).
In SCA8 autopsy brain, positive pan-nuclear staining is found in Purkinje cells (c, d) at a similar frequency to 1C2 immunostaining (~25% of remaining Purkinje cells), while no staining is found in control autopsy brain (e).
