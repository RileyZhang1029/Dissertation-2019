BIOINFORMATICS Vol.30 ISMB 2014, pages i246 i254 doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu287 Gene network inference by probabilistic scoring of relationships from a factorized model of interactions Marinka Zitnik1 and Bla z Zupan1,2,* 1Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia and 2Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA ABSTRACT Motivation: Epistasis analysis is an essential tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of function of genes in a common pathway.
Typically, it considers single and double mutant phenotypes and for a pair of genes observes whether a change in the first gene masks the effects of the mutation in the second gene.
Despite the recent emer- gence of biotechnology techniques that can provide gene interaction data on a large, possibly genomic scale, few methods are available for quantitative epistasis analysis and epistasis-based network reconstruction.
Results: We here propose a conceptually new probabilistic approach to gene network inference from quantitative interaction data.
The ap- proach is founded on epistasis analysis.
Its features are joint treatment of the mutant phenotype data with a factorized model and probabil- istic scoring of pairwise gene relationships that are inferred from the latent gene representation.
The resulting gene network is assembled from scored pairwise relationships.
In an experimental study, we show that the proposed approach can accurately reconstruct several known pathways and that it surpasses the accuracy of current approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION Epistasis analysis is a tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of genes in pathways from mutant-based phenotypes (Avery and Wasserman, 1992 Botstein and Maurer, 1982). Epistasis asserts that two genes interact if the mutation in one gene masks the effects of perturbations in the other gene.
Then, assuming a common pathway, the first masking gene would be downstream, and the products of the second gene would regulate the expression of the first one (Avery and Wasserman, 1992 Cordell, 2002 Huang and Sternberg, 1995 Roth et al., 2009). Epistasis analysis uncovers the relationship between a pair of genes.
Its logic can be further extended to uncover parallelism, where both genes have an effect on the phenotype but where there is no epistasis (Battle et al., 2010 Zupan et al., 2003) (Fig. 1). Uncovered pairwise relationships in a group of genes can give rise to a reconstruction of more complex multi-gene networks.
An enlightening demonstration of the power of epis- tasis for assembly of gene networks is for instance a reconstruc- tion of a four-gene cell death pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans (Metzstein et al., 1998). *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
Emergent technologies from molecular biology that record phenotypes of single and double mutants at a large, possibly genomic scale, prompt for the development of systematic approaches for epistasis analysis and pose the need to devise computational tools that support gene network inference.
Approaches of mutagenesis by homologous recombination (Collins et al., 2006 Tong et al., 2004) or RNA interference can yield phenotype observations for thousands or even millions of mutants (Costanzo et al., 2010). Several past studies con- sidered mutant assays with qualitative phenotypes (Zupan (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig.1.
A hypothetical example of epistasis analysis with three genes, u, v and w. Nodes in the central graph represent mutant phenotypes. The phenotypic difference between a double knockout [e.g. Rðu v Þ] and a single knockout mutant [e.g. Rðv Þ] is represented with the length of the corresponding dotted edge.
Expected double mutant phenotypes, which assume no interaction between genes (see also Section 2.1), are denoted with E [e.g. Eðu v Þ]. A double mutant u v (a) has a phenotype similar to that of a single mutant v , which indicates that v is epistatic to u.
From the activity of genes v and w (b) we conjecture that gene v partially de- pends on gene w, i.e. v also acts through a separate pathway because their double mutant v w has a phenotype that is equally similar to the sin- gle knockout Rðw Þ and the expected phenotype Eðv w Þ. The pheno- type of double knockout u w (c) is close to the expected phenotype of u w  Eðu w Þ which may be explained by u and w acting independ- ently in parallel pathways.
Gene ordering from these three relations is preserved in the joint network (d), which is a candidate pathway of genes u, v and w ß The Author 2014.

Majority of these studies present gene networks as collections of directly observed pairwise interactions (e.g. Phenix et al., 2013 St Onge et al., 2007) and do not propose a generally ap- plicable formalism to model the data.
Only few general-purpose algorithms for inference of epistatic networks have been pro- posed.
Zupan et al. (2003) introduced formal rules and inference algorithm to infer different types of relationships between genes, but could treat only qualitative phenotypes and could not handle noise.
These limitations were elegantly bypassed by a Bayesian approach of Battle et al. (2010) that can handle larger data sets with few hundred genes.
This algorithm is to our knowledge also the only modern approach to inference of epistasis networks.
(e.g. Ahn et Gene epistasis analysis infers interactions that stem directly from mutant phenotypes. Its causative reasoning is different from other network reconstruction tools that observe correl- ations between gene profiles 2011 Mohammadi et al., 2012) and infer relationships that are circum- stantial (Hughes et al., 2000). Despite the growing body of quan- titative genetic interaction data and our ability to collect such data, computational approaches and tools to support epistasis are at best scarce (Battle et al., 2010 Jaimovich and Friedman, 2011 Zhang and Zhao, 2013). Devising methods for inference of gene pathways from mutant-based phenotypes and developing related software tools remains a major challenge of computa- tional systems biology.
al., We here present a new epistasis analysis-inspired computa- tional approach to infer gene networks from a collection of quantitative mutant phenotypes. We refer to our method as R ed (pronounced as r ed, meaning order in Slovene). Our work was motivated by the Bayesian learning method of Battle et al. (2010), henceforth denoted by activity pathway network (APN), that starts from a random network and then iteratively refines it to best match data-inferred relationships.
The model refinement in APN is carried out through a succession of local structural changes of the evolving network.
This procedure may substantially depend on (arbitrary) initialization of network structure, and hence requires ensembling across many runs of the algorithm to raise accuracy of the final network.
Our approach is conceptually different from APN. We first simultaneously infer a probabilistic model for the entire set of pairwise relationships.
Relationship probabilities serve as prefer- ences for different types of pairwise relationships (e.g. epistasis, parallelism and partial interdependence) used in a single-step construction of a gene network.
In contrast to APN s local net- work changes, R ed applies a global procedure to infer the rela- tionships between genes and does not require ensembling. The probabilistic model of R ed uses matrix completion-derived latent data representation to account for noise and sparsity.
Inference of factorized model also includes construction of a gene-specific data transformation to account for the differences in single mutant backgrounds, which may affect the phenotype of double mutants.
In an experimental study, we show that both components are necessary for inferring gene networks of high accuracy.
Gene network inference 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS R ed, the proposed gene network reconstruction algorithm (Alg. 1), con- siders quantitative phenotype measurements over a set of single and double mutants, provides preferential order-of-action scores of possible pairwise relationships and assembles them in a joint gene network.
The essential steps of the algorithm are overviewed in Figure 2 and are described in detail below.
2.1 Problem definition In quantitative analysis of genetic interactions we typically observe pair- wise interactions between n genes and measure mutant phenotypes, such as the fitness of an organism or expression of a reporter gene (Reporter). Measurements over a set of double knockout mutants are given in a sparse matrix G 2 Rn n and those of single knockout mutants in a vector S 2 Rn: In these matrices, Gu v quantifies a phenotype of double mutant u v and Su denotes a phenotype of single mutant u : The expected mutant phenotypes, which represent phenotypes of double mutants in the absence of genetic interactions, are given by a matrix H. We aim to reconstruct a gene network that is consistent with pairwise gene relationships inferred from G, H and S. Inputs to network recon- struction are preferential scores for all four modeled gene relationships that include epistasis u ! v, epistasis u  v, parallelism vjju and partial interdependence vnu (Table 1). R ed represents the scores as P=ðP! P  Pjj PnÞ and computes them from the latent gene representation, which is obtained in the inference of a factorized model.
Fig.2.
An overview of R ed, a novel approach for automatic gene net- work inference from mutant data.
Inputs to the preferential order-of- action factorized algorithm of R ed include a matrix of double knockout phenotypes (G), a vector of single knockout phenotypes (S) and a matrix of expected phenotypes corresponding to the assumption of absent inter- actions between genes (H). R ed estimates a factorized model from G, whose gene latent feature vectors capture the global structure of the phenotype landscape, and learns a parametrized logistic map ), which is a gene-dependent non-linear mapping from latent to phenotype space.
A scoring scheme is then applied to the inferred model to estimate the probabilities of pairwise gene relationships of different types.
Finally, a multi-gene network is reconstructed, which aims to minimize the number of violating and redundant edges i247  M. Zitnik and B.Zupan Table 1.

These relationships have already been considered by Battle et al. (2010) but are here studied with probabilistic scoring functions.
See main text for explanation of preferential order-of-action scores.
2.2 Factorized model To deal with noise and address possibly incomplete input data, R ed es- timates probabilities of gene relationships through a factorized model.
We use a Bayesian inference approach and formulate the conditional probability of observed double mutant phenotype data, given their latent representation, as follows: Y Y pðGjU V )  2 GÞ= n n ðNðGu vjgðUT u Vv )u vÞ  2 GÞÞIG u v  u=1 v=1 where Nðxj  2Þ is a normal distribution with mean  and variance 2, indicates whether the phenotypic measurement of u v is and IG u v available.
We assume that the observed phenotype of u v is governed by the latent features associated with both genes u and v. To learn the latent features of u and v, we factorize double mutant phenotype data (G) into a product of two low-dimensional latent matrix factors Uk n and Vk n. Their column vectors, Uu and Vv, represent k-dimensional u-specific and v-specific gene latent feature vectors, respectively.
Instead of using linear latent Gaussian model of gene interactions, we pass the dot product UT u Vv through a parametrized logistic function g. Thus, the model of interaction between genes u and v is represented by the factorized par- ameter gðUT u Vv )u vÞ. In the factorization, gene interactions depend on each other, as they overlap and share parameters.
For instance, given genes u, v and w, their factorized parameters gðUT u Vw  )u wÞ share a common gene latent feature vector Uu. u Vv )u vÞ and gðUT Parametrized logistic function g is given by ð3Þ gðx  ð1Þ  ð2Þ  ð3ÞÞ= 1+ ð1Þexp ð ð2ÞxÞ and bounds the range of factorized parameters by modeling saturation of the Reporter.
Here, parameter ð3Þ represents the limiting value of the output past that gðx  ð1Þ  ð2Þ  ð3ÞÞ cannot grow and ð1Þ represents the u Vv must grow to reach the value of ð3Þ: If ð2Þ is number of times that UT positive, g is increasing in x, otherwise g is a decreasing function.
Note that gðx 1 1 1Þ corresponds to the well-known sigmoid function.
For every double mutant u v , we represent its logistic function parameters in a triple )u v=ð)ð1Þ u vÞ and define ) to hold the parametrized logistic function representation over all possible double mutants: )=ð)ð1Þ )ð2Þ )ð3ÞÞ. We reduce the complexity of this factorized model in Section 2.3 by replacing dense parametrization of ) (one par- ameter set for every factorized parameter, j)j=3n2Þ with gene-dependent parametrization (one parameter set for every gene, j)j=3n). u v )ð3Þ u v )ð2Þ i248 We use a Gaussian prior centered at 1 for logistic function paramet- rization ) over given phenotypic measurements: Y Y Y 3 n n pð)j 2 )Þ= ðNð)ðiÞ u vj1  2 )IÞÞIG u v : i=1 u=1 v=1 For gene latent feature vectors in U and V we assume zero-mean Gaussian priors to avoid overfitting: Y n pðUj 2 UÞ= NðUuj0  2 UIÞ pðVj 2 VÞ= Y n NðVvj0  2 VIÞ: u=1 v=1 Through Bayesian inference we derive the posterior probability of gene latent vectors and logistic function parametrization given the available double mutants phenotypes: pðU V )jG  2 G  2 U  2 V  2 )Þ / pðGjU V )  2 GÞpðUj 2 UÞ )Þ: VÞpð)j 2 pðVj 2 ð1Þ We select the factorized model according to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation by maximizing the log-posterior of Equation (1) over latent feature matrices and logistic function parametrization. The meas- urement noise variance ( 2 )) are kept fixed.
This is equivalent to minimizing the following objective function (see Supplementary Material for a detailed derivation of a MAP estima- tor), which is a sum of squared errors with quadratic regularization terms: G) and prior variances ( 2 V and 2 U  2 LðG U V )Þ= 1 2 u vðGu v  gðUT IG X u Vv )u vÞÞ2 X X n n u=1 v=1 X n ð2Þ + +  U 2  ) 2 UT X u Uu+ X n n u=1 X 3 i=1 u=1 v=1  V 2 n VT v Vv v=1 u vð)ðiÞ IG u v  1Þ2  G= 2 G= 2 G= 2 ). U  V= 2 V and )= 2 where U= 2 Because ), U and V are unknown, the function L is not convex.
In particular, L is convex in either U or V but not in both factors together, which is a known result from matrix factorization studies (Koren et al., 2009 Lee and Seung, 2000). In our study, L is further coupled by the parametrization of ). Thus, it is unrealistic to expect an algorithm to solve the optimization problem defined by L in the sense of finding global minimum.
We thus estimate latent features and logistic function parameters by finding a local minimum of the objective functionL through  ð3Þ ð4Þ ð5Þ ð6Þ ð7Þ application of gradient descent.
Derivatives of L with respect to gene latent features and logistic parameters are given by the following equations: @L @Uu @L @Vv X n = v=1 X n = u=1 hðu vÞVvg0ðUT u Vv )u vÞ+ UUu  hðu vÞUug0ðUT u Vv )u vÞ+ VVv  @L @)ð1Þ u v =  hðu vÞ)ð3Þ ðexp ð)ð2Þ @L @)ð2Þ u v = hðu vÞ)ð1Þ u v)ð3Þ ðexp ð)ð2Þ u VvÞ u vÞ2 +tðu v 1Þ  u vexp ð)ð2Þ u vUT u VvÞ+)ð1Þ u vUT u Vvexp ð)ð2Þ u vUT u vÞ2 u VvÞ+)ð1Þ u VvÞ +tðu v 3Þ  u vUT u vUT hðu vÞ u VvÞ +tðu v 2Þ  u v = 1+)ð1Þ u vexp ð )ð2Þ @L @)ð3Þ convenience of notation, hðu vÞ u vð)ðiÞ u vUT where for substituted for hðu vÞ=IG u vðgðUT u Vv )u vÞ  Gu vÞ, penalty term tðu v iÞ stands for tðu v iÞ= )IG u v  1Þ and g0ðx )u vÞ is logistic function derivative with respect to x.
Efficiency in training R ed model comes from finding point estimates of model unknowns instead of inferring the full posterior distribution over them.
is 2.3 Gene-dependent weighting We further reduce complexity of the model described in the previous section by combining evidence from multiple phenotypic measurements through their latent representation.
We replace entrywise (double- mutant-phenotype-dependent) logistic function parametrization ) with gene-dependent parametrization that is given by )ðiÞ u w for i = 1, 2, 3.
This reduces the number of parameters in ) that have to be learned from 3n2 to 3n. Intuitively, measurements that involve gene u are not independent from each other but are rather governed by the gene pathways in which u participates.
Gene-dependent parametrization of ) represents a method of regularization allowing us to remove penalty terms in Equations (5) (7). u v  1 n 1 w )ðiÞ P Derivatives of ) use only available phenotypic measurements owing to the application of an indicator function [cf. Equations (5) (7)]. We relax this limitation by considering current estimates of G when computing the derivatives of ).

Estimated probabilities in P approach 1 when inferred pheno- typic values in ^G are close to the phenotypes, which would be expected if a certain network structure (! jj n) existed between genes, and they slowly vanish when the inferred values deviate from the values ex- pected by a certain type of relationship.
For instance, an epistatic genetic interaction u  v is inferred when the trait ^Gu v of the double mutant u v is similar to the single mutant u phenotype Su and the two single mutant phenotypes are different (Su 6 Sv). This brings j ^Gu v  Suj close to 0 and, consequently, P u v close to 1.
With different single mutant phenotypes, the expected phenotype Hu v of the double mutant that assumes no genetic inter- action phenotypes (Su 6 Sv ) Sv 6 Hu v ^ Su 6 Hu v), bringing Pjj u v close to 0.
Likewise, the phenotype of v would be different from the phenotype of the double mutant, bringing P! single mutant u v and Pn from both different is u v close to 0.
Gene network inference Cases with less pronounced differences between phenotypes would lead to smaller differences in relationship probabilities.
Preferential order-of- action scores generalize the epistasis analysis framework by Avery and Wasserman (1992), wherein the signal and the genes under study were strictly on or off with no intermediate levels of activity.
An appealing feature of they have a direct probabilistic interpretation.
scores in P is that 2.5 Multi-gene network inference Given probabilistic scores of gene gene network structures in P from Section 2.4, we reconstruct a detailed multi-gene network that is consist- ent with the inferred relationship probabilities and contains a minimum number of violating and redundant edges.
Examples of inferred networks are given in Figures 4 7.
A network is a weighted directed graph with genes as vertices and directed edges that determine the order of action.
A designated vertex represents the observed quantitative trait.
A directed edge from u to v is violating (Fig. 3a) if there is evidence in P for both u ! v and u  v (e.g. P! u v). A directed edge from u to v is redun- dant (Fig. 3b) if there is evidence in P that some intermediate gene exists between u and v. That is, u and v are not adjacent in a genetic network but rather u indirectly affects v, i.e. P! u v captures the extent to which strict weak ordering of u and v holds.
u v  P  Network inference procedure assigns a level to every gene in a manner that if there is strong evidence in P that gene u is placed upstream of gene v, that is, if v is epistatic to u, then levelðuÞ4levelðvÞ: In the case of stronger evidence of parallelism or partial interdependence between u and v the levelðuÞ  levelðvÞ: Several genes can be assigned the same level, but a designated vertex corresponding to a phenotype of interest is the only vertex placed on the lowest level.
Inference of a genetic network involves two phases.
In the first phase we perform an approximate topological sort through construction of a directed weighted graph.
Given genes u and v and the inferred epistasis relationships between them, the direction and weight of a between-level u v (edge u ! v) and edge are determined by the maximum of the values P! u v (edge u  v). Given a parallelism or partial interdependence rela- P tionship between u and v, a within-level edge is determined by the max- u v (edge u ! v). imum of the values Pjj This graph may contain directed cycles, and finding an exact topological ordering of its vertices with the minimal set of violating edges is a known NP-hard problem (Charbit et al., 2007 Eades et al., 1993). Thus, we pro- ceed in the following way.
We select a vertex with no incoming between- u v (no edge between u and v) and Pn (a) (b) Fig.3.
Illustration of violating (a) and redundant (b) edges (in gray) in a pathway with four genes.
Edge y1 ! v1 is violating because there is evi- dence that v1 is placed upstream of y1 (v1 ! w1 and w1 ! y1) but also that y1 is upstream of v1 (y1 ! v1). Edge u2 ! w2 is redundant because there is evidence of an intermediate gene v2: Similarly, edge u2 ! y2 is redundant because of two intervening genes, v2 and w2 i249  M. Zitnik and B.Zupan level edges, assign that vertex to the currently top-most level and recurse on the graph with that vertex removed.
We also look for vertices with no outgoing between-level edges and assign them to the currently lowest level.
If in some step multiple vertices have no incoming or outgoing be- tween-level edges, they are assigned the same level.
It can happen that all vertices have incoming and outgoing between-level edges.
In this case, we select the vertex with the highest differential between weighted incoming between-level degree and weighted outgoing between-level degree.

3 DATA AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP We assess the accuracy of R ed by applying our inference ap- proach to the datasets of Jonikas et al. (2009) and Surma et al. (2013) and compare results to known or partially known net- works.
Experiments that use data from Jonikas et al. closely i250 follow the setup by Battle et al. and use the same datasets and reference pathways.
3.1 Mutant phenotype data Jonikas et al. (2009) measured unfolded protein response (UPR) levels in single and double mutants to systematically characterize functional interdependence of yeast genes with roles in endoplas- mic reticulum (ER) folding.
The dataset contains 444 genes that caused high UPR reporter inductions.
The interaction data in- clude phenotypes of 42 240 distinct double mutants (matrix G) corresponding to 43% of all possible double mutants.
Jonikas et al. also computed typical (i.e. expected) values of genetic interactions for every double mutant (matrix H). They con- sidered multiplicative neutrality function (Mani et al., 2008) and computed it using reporter levels of pairs of single mutants, modified by a Hill function to account for the saturation of the reporter signal.
Surma et al. (2013) considered 741 genes and observed the growth phenotype (colony size) for all pairs of double mutants.
In total, after filtering out unreliable measurements, their dataset comprises 251 383 double mutant fitness scores.
We computed single mutant scores by averaging across all scores of double mutants that included mutations of the corresponding genes.
We considered multiplicative model to calculate the expected fitness of a double mutant in the absence of a genetic interaction.
3.2 Gene pathways We compare gene networks inferred by R ed to a number of known or partially known cellular pathways that include genes whose perturbations are measured by Jonikas et al. :  The N-linked glycosylation pathway consisting of 10 genes whose true ordering is known (Helenius and Aebi, 2004),  The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for which interdependencies between its member many functional genes are known,  Tail-anchored (TA) protein biogenesis machinery consisting of TA proteins important for transmembrane trafficking and the recently discovered GET pathway (Bozkurt et al., 2009 Schuldiner et al., 2008 Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007). We also compare R ed s networks to well-characterized cellular pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis whose gene mutants are measured by Surma et al. and that include the following:  The Kennedy pathway involved in the synthesis of phospha- tidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and  The phosphatidylserine to PC conversion pathway.
3.3 Experimental setup In the first part of the experiments, we use mutant phenotype data to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction of five gene pathways from Section 3.2.
In the second part of the experi- ments, we evaluate the accuracy of gene ordering through three different setups.
In the first two setups, the data-inferred gene ordering was compared with the known pathways.
In the third setup, we use cross-validation to estimate the accuracy of  Gene network inference Fig.4.
Gene network of the N-linked glycosylation pathway inferred by R ed.
For reference, we show the true ordering of this pathway (Helenius and Aebi, 2004) as adapted from Battle et al. (2010). The inferred gene network reflects many correct gene placements prediction of gene interaction scores with the following experiments: 1.
Battle et al. (2010) provided 168 test gene pairs (v, u) from common KEGG pathways (Kanehisa et al., 2008). For 21 gene pairs v is known to be upstream of u, and for 147 gene pairs v is not known to be upstream of u.
Given a gene pair, R ed predicted the probability of epistasis as u v=ðP! u vÞ, and the accuracy of predictions on P! entire set of 168 gene pairs.
u v+P  2.
Using the setup from Battle et al. we evaluate the accur- acy of prediction of direct edges u ! v in the N-linked glycosylation pathway (Fig. 4) based on the model-esti- mated probability of epistasis P! u v. 3.
We estimate the accuracy when predicting that two genes are in epistasis, that is, u ! v or v ! u.
Note that in the literature this relationship is also referred to as an alleviat- ing interaction, where the phenotype of a double mutant is less severe than expected from the phenotypes of the cor- responding single mutants (Jonikas et al., 2009 Mani et al., 2008). For the data from Jonikas et al. this means that the double-mutant cell responds to ER stress surprisingly better than how the ER stress would typically be mitigated.
The data for this experiment were preprocessed according to the procedure described by Battle et al. A positive set included gene pairs (u, v) with significant alleviating genetic interactions, for which the observed phenotype (inter- action score) was negative with a magnitude greater than jGu v  max ðSu SvÞÞj (see St Onge et al., 2007). It was fur- ther required that the double-mutant phenotype data con- tained a sufficient number of observations that included u or v , such that the geometric mean of such measurements for u and for v was at least 180.
There are 2723 gene pairs in the data of Jonikas et al. that match these criteria.
In each test run, we form a test set with a random selection of 5% of the positive gene pairs and a negative set of equal size of gene pairs that fail to satisfy the selection criteria.
We remove the test data from the interaction score matrix G, and predict whether a test gene pair is alleviating using the probability that u and v occur together in a linear pathway, i.e. P! u v. We report an averaged accuracy across 10 different test runs.
u v+P  We compare R ed, our network inference approach, with a recently published Bayesian approach by Battle et al. They de- veloped preference scoring functions over all possible pairwise gene relationships and applied annealed importance sampling to reconstruct high scoring multi-gene networks.
Their method (referred here as APN) was shown to be superior to a number of other approaches that can infer networks from gene inter- action data by Jonikas et al. These other approaches include baseline techniques such as Pearson correlation of genetic inter- action profiles and raw interaction values as well as more sophis- ticated techniques such as Gaussian process regression (GP Williams and Rasmussen, 1996), a method that uses the correl- ation of observed interaction profiles, the diffusion kernel method (DK Qi et al., 2008) and GenePath (Zupan et al., 2003). For brevity, we therefore focus on comparing our method with APN, which was run with default parameters as chosen by Battle et al. for the dataset of Jonikas et al., but we also report the accuracies achieved by GP and DK. Two essential components of R ed are latent representation of gene interactions and their transformation through the logistic function.
To test the extent to which the performance of R ed depends on these two components we also run experiments where the algorithm infers probabilities and makes predictions from raw (not factorized) phenotypes, and where the latent rep- resentation is used without logistic transformation.
We refer to these two approaches as RAW and MF, respectively.
In all experiments with data from Jonikas et al., the param- eters of R ed are set as U= V=1  10 4  =0:1  =0:1 k=100. The same parameters are used on data from Surma et al. with the exception of =1  10 3 and k = 50, which were selected to minimize the normalized root mean square error of ^G. This choice of regularization parameters and learning rates is common (cf. Min and Lee, 2005 Pedregosa et al., 2011). We also show (see Supplementary Material Supplementary Fig.S4) that the performance of R ed does not critically depend on the rank of factorization k. R ed s optimization by gradient des- cent is terminated when the Frobenius distance between G and ^G over known values fails to decrease between the two consecutive iterations of optimization.
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We characterize the accuracy of predictions through the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), with a baseline of 0.5 (random networks) and a perfect score of 1.0 (inferred networks that are identical to gold standard known networks). 4.1 Reconstruction of a known gene pathway from data by Jonikas et al. (2009) We analyzed the ability of R ed to reconstruct the known N-linked glycosylation pathway.
Figure 4 shows the inferred net- work next to the known pathway as reported by Helenius and i251  M. Zitnik and B.Zupan Aebi (2004). Genes CWH41, DIE2 and ALG8 are correctly placed such that they are dependent on the other genes.
Also, ALG12 is placed upstream of ALG9, which is also upstream of ALG3. OST3 is correctly placed downstream, but OST5 is in- correctly placed, likely because double-mutant data with the other ALG genes were not available.
Surprisingly, R ed correctly placed CWH41, a gene that encodes glucosidase I, an integral membrane protein of the ER involved in sensing ER stress (Romero et al., 1997), at the beginning of the pathway despite mild downstream effects observed in CWH41 mutants.
Note that the interaction profile of CWH41 is only moderately correlated with those of ALG genes, and thus, CWH41 was not clustered together with them (Jonikas et al., 2009). We hence conclude that R ed inference of the N-linked glycans synthesis pathway was successful with a network that closely resembles that reported in the literature.
4.2 Reconstruction of known gene pathways from data by Surma et al. (2013) We applied R ed to mutant data by Surma et al. to reconstruct two thoroughly studied pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis.
R ed s ordering of genes in the phosphatidylserine to PC conver- sion pathway is fully consistent with the reference pathway (Fig. 5a). In the Kennedy pathway, R ed correctly placed PCT1 upstream of CPT1 and CKI1 upstream of CPT1 with high con- fidence (Fig. 5b), but it misplaced gene pair PCT1 and CKI1 likely owing to the ambiguity in the data.
However, as R ed per- forms global reasoning by combining evidence from all measure- ments, it handled the data uncertainty by assigning PCT1 ! (a) (b) CKI1 structure the lowest score in the reconstruction of the Kennedy pathway.
4.3 Reconstruction of partially known gene pathways Jonikas et al. (2009) identified several pathways that are import- ant for ER protein folding.
Of these, the pathways for ERAD and TA protein insertion were considered in Battle et al. (2010). R ed-inferred networks for these two pathways are shown in Figures 6 and 7.
The solid edges in these figures are those inferred by our algorithm, while the dotted edges indicate gene interactions reported in the literature (Battle et al., 2010 Carvalho et al., 2006 Clerc et al., 2009 Jonikas et al., 2009 Kim et al., 2005 Nakatsukasa and Brodsky, 2008). The ordering of inferred networks is entirely consistent with the partially known gene pathways.
For instance, in the network for the ERAD pathway (Fig. 6), the upstream placement of MNL1 to YOS9 is consistent with existing data showing that MNL1 generates the sugar species recognized by YOS9 (Clerc et al., 2009). Also, MNL1, YOS9, DER1 and USA1 are placed upstream of HRD3 and HRD1, which is compatible with data showing that degradation of certain substrates requires all six (Carvalho et al., 2006 Kim et al., 2005 components Nakatsukasa and Brodsky, 2008). For the TA protein insertion pathway, R ed inferred a network (Fig. 7) that placed the poorly characterized protein SGT2 upstream of the TA protein biogen- esis machinery components according to its function in the inser- tion of TA proteins into membranes (Battle et al., 2010). Similarly, positive results of network inference are also re- ported in (Battle et al., 2010). Their method inferred a number Fig.5.
Gene networks of the phosphatidylserine to PC conversion path- way (a) and the Kennedy pathway (b) as inferred by R ed.
For reference, we show the true orderings in both pathways adapted from Surma et al. (2013). R ed correctly and with high confidence (P40:80) inferred all three pairwise gene relationships of the PC conversion pathway.
It also correctly predicted two out of three gene relationships of the Kennedy pathway with the wrong prediction (PCT1 ! CKI1) being assigned a low confidence (P=0:25) Fig.7.

Note that the predicted ordering strongly reflects known interdependencies between genes Fig.6.

The predictive accuracy (AUC) of gene ordering by a Bayesian learning method [APN Battle et al. (2010)], R ed, our proposed approach, and its simplified variants: without factorization (RAW) and with factor- ization but in the absence of transformation by logistic function (MF) Prediction AUC RAW MF APN R ed KEGG pathway ordering N-linked glycosylation pathway 0.563 0.591 0.583 0.638 0.648 0.731 0.728 0.749 2008). R ed achieves significantly higher accuracy than GP (P50.01) and DK (P50.001), although the difference with GP is small and may be worthy of further study.
Note that RAW, a R ed variant without factorization, is not applicable for this ex- periment, as it does not generalize across gene interaction scores.
We have observed that the probabilities of alleviating gene pairs predicted by R ed are well correlated to the strength of alleviating interactions (Spearman r=  0:704 P 51  10 100 Supplementary Fig.S3). R ed scores gene pairs with stronger alleviating effects (negative interaction values with greater mag- nitude) higher than those that interact moderately.

of candidate networks of which the best-scored were shown to be partially consistent with known gene interdependencies. In con- trast, for each pathway, R ed inferred a single network that is entirely consistent with known gene relationships.
4.4 Quantitative analysis of gene ordering Table 2 reports the accuracies of gene ordering prediction ob- tained by four different algorithms, R ed, APN and two simpli- fied variants of R ed.
In comparison with APN, R ed performs substantially better in predicting the edges of the KEGG path- ways and slightly better in predicting the edges of the N-linked glycosylation pathway (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The poor performance of the simplified variants of R ed (RAW and MF) indicates that R ed s latent representation inferred from the factorized model, the non-linear logistic map and gene- dependent weighting are the essential components of R ed.
Without any of these, R ed would not be able to achieve the resulting accuracy.
4.5 Prediction of alleviating genetic interactions Given the training and separate test datasets, we predict whether an interaction is alleviating (see Section 3.3). Table 3 shows that R ed performs substantially better than APN (P50.001). R ed also outperforms standard two-factor matrix factorization (MF) by a large margin, which is an indicator that transform- ation via a logistic map is essential to the performance of our algorithm.
We compare these results with those obtained by GP (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996) using squared exponential auto- correlation model constructed from the genetic interaction pro- files, and with the interactions predicted with the DK (Qi et al., 5 CONCLUSION R ed is a conceptually new approach for inference of gene net- works from quantitative genetic interaction data.
It implements a probabilistic epistasis analysis and assembles pairwise relation- ships into gene networks.
In our experiments, R ed was able to reconstruct several known and partially known pathways with accuracy above that of the state-of-the-art approaches.
R ed out- performs APN, the state-of-the-art method by Battle et al. (2010), both in accuracy and speed, with CPU runtime of only a few minutes compared with APN s 30 min for an inference of a single full network in an ensemble of 500 networks.
We also show that R ed s power of generalization comes from its two key components, a factorized model with latent representation of gene interactions and a gene-dependent logistic map of inter- action scores.
Our evaluation in this article was computational and thus limited to datasets for which several gene pathways or at least partial gene orderings were available (Battle et al., 2010 Jonikas et al., 2009). R ed can efficiently handle similar datasets as well as much larger ones, such as that from the recent yeast experiments by Costanzo et al. (2010). These are also the datasets for which we foresee future applications of R ed and which will require subsequent verification of inferred networks in the wet lab.
