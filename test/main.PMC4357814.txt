The second phase of the project comprised 1640 datasets from 147 different cell types, yielding a set of 30 pub- lications across several journals.
These data revealed that 80.4% of the human genome displays some functionality in at least one cell type.
Many of these regulatory elements are physically asso- ciated with one another and further form a network or three-dimensional conformation to affect gene expression.
These elements are also related to sequence variants associated with diseases or traits.
All these ﬁndings provide us new insights into the organization and regulation of genes and genome, and serve as an expansive resource for understanding human health and disease.
Introduction The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is an international collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Institute (NHGRI). It aims to pick up where the Human Genome Project left off, includ- ing the functional DNA sequences that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control gene expression in which cells and when [1]. The ﬁrst pilot phase, started in 2003, accrued such information on just 1% of the * Corresponding author.

Researchers found that many important regulators of gene expression lie some- where in the deserts between the genes and many of them have evolved rapidly [2]. After the initial pilot phase, scien- tists started a second round of technology development phase to apply their methods to the entire genome in 2007 and closed successfully in September 2012 with the promotion of several new technologies to generate high throughput data on functional elements, signaled by the publication of 30 pa- pers in Nature (5 papers), Genome Research (18 papers), Gen- ome Biology (6 papers) and BMC Genetics (1 paper).

identiﬁed by genome-wide Human genome reference re-annotation A correctly- annotated gene reference for a particular project is extremely important for any downstream analysis such as con- servation, variation and functionality of a sequence.
As a sub- project of the ENCODE project, the GENCODE consortium aims to annotate all evidence-based gene features, including all protein-coding loci with alternatively transcribed variants, non-coding loci with transcript evidence and pseudogenes, in the entire human genome at a high accuracy using a combina- tion of computational analysis, manual annotation, and exper- imental validation.
The GENCODE 7 release contained 20,687 [3]. sites start (TSSs) (Table 2) protein-coding genes and 33,977 noncoding transcripts that were not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. Among them, 62% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites and 35% of transcripts are supported by combinatorial analy- sis of gene-cluster evolution (CAGE) cluster at the transcrip- tional In addition, GENCODE 7 contains 9640 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, representing 15,512 transcripts, consisting of 5058 long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) loci, 3214 antisense loci, 378 sense intronic loci and 930 processed transcript loci, which is the largest manually-curated catalog of human lncRNAs cur- rently publicly available (Table 2) [3]. GENCODE also anno- tated 11,216 pseudogenes, of which 863 were transcribed and associated with active chromatin (Table 2) [4]. Compared with non-transcribed pseudogenes, transcribed pseudogenes showed higher conservation, much more upstream regulatory se- quences and stronger tissue speciﬁcity, indicating that tran- scribed pseudogenes possess conventional characteristics of functionality [4].

DNA methylation was found to be located genome-wise with a pattern of low promoter methylation and high gene- body methylation in highly-expressed genes [10]. Moreover, the DNA methylation landscapes were proﬁled quantitatively in total of 82 human cell lines and tissues using RRBS, yielding 1.2 million CpGs on average in each cell type [11]. In pulmon- ary ﬁbroblasts (IMR90), signiﬁcantly low methylation was de- tected at CpG dinucleotides within DNase I footprints, compared to CpGs in non-footprinted regions of the same DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS). These data suggest that occupancy of regulatory factors may be widely connected with methylation at nucleotide levels [12]. Landscape of transcription Local chromatin structure ENCODE provided a genome-wide catalogue of human tran- scripts and identiﬁed their subcellular localization by sequenc- ing RNA from 15 cell lines in three subcellular fractions (whole cell, nucleus and cytosol) and in three additional subnuclear compartments (chromatin, nucleolus, and nucleoplasm) in K562 cell [5]. Cumulatively, a total of 62.1% and 74.7% of the human genome were observed to be covered by either pro- cessed or primary transcripts, respectively.
Coding and non- coding transcripts are predominantly localized in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, with higher expression of protein- coding genes on average than that of non-coding RNAs. Approximately 6% of all annotated coding and non-coding transcripts overlap with small RNAs (sRNAs) and are proba- bly precursors of these sRNAs. Furthermore, the analysis of RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K562 revealed that splicing occurs predomi- nantly during transcription and is fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA [6]. In addition, lncRNAs curated manually by GENCODE have canonical gene structures and histone mod- iﬁcations, are expressed at lower levels, appear to be subjected to weaker evolutionary constraint than coding genes and are preferentially enriched in nucleus of the cell [7]. Meta-analysis of 737 mouse and human sRNA datasets yielded 237 and 240 splicing-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) in mouse and human, respectively.
These miRNAs comprised three classes: conven- tional mirtrons, 50-tailed mirtrons and 30-tailed mirtrons. Some members in each class are conserved, indicating their incorpo- ration into beneﬁcial regulatory networks [8]. DNA methylation Methylation of cytosine at CpG dinucleotides is an important epigenetic regulatory modiﬁcation in many eukaryotic gen- omes. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulﬁte sequencing (RRBS), Meissner et al. generated methylation maps covering most CpG islands in mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived neural cells, primary neural cells and eight other primary tissues [9]. CpGs located in open chromatin regions are generally lowly methylated, whereas hypermethylated regions are marked by H3K9me3. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation patterns during ES cells differen- tiation were strongly correlated with those in histone methyla- tion patterns.
In human B-lymphocytes, a DNA methylation map was generated through two methods, bisulﬁte padlock probe (BSPP) assay and methyl-sensitive cut counting (MSCC) The hallmark of regulatory DNA regions is chromatin accessi- bility, which is characterized by DNase I hypersensitivity.
Stam- atoyannopoulos and his collaborators mapped 2.89 million unique non-overlapping DHSs by DNase-seq in 125 cell types.
About one third of them were found in only one cell type, with only 3700 detected in all cell types, suggesting that the genome is differentially regulated from cell to cell [13]. Majority (approxi- mately 75%) of the DHSs identiﬁed by ENCODE were located in distal intronic or intergenic regions, indicating that the previ- ously-considered junk sequences are functional somehow.
Fur- thermore, higher DNase I hypersensitivity and CG content were enriched in TSSs, of which chromatin state was largely invariant across multiple cell lines as demonstrated using DNase-seq across 19 cell types in a genome-wide fashion [14]. A set of puta- tive distal regulatory elements, up to 500 kb distant from pro- moters, were generated based on the correlations between distal DHSs and promoters [13]. Nucleosomes are located in the ﬂanking regions of open chromatin where DHSs are enriched and post-translational modiﬁcation of the histone tails occurs at the core of nucleo- somes. The nucleosome occupancy in GM12878 and K562 cells that was mapped by MNase-seq was highly heterogeneous and asymmetry at TSSs and showed a weak correlation with transcriptional activity [15]. Histone modiﬁcation is another regulatory factor that affects the chromatin conformation.
Early studies on individual modiﬁcations have shown that they function in both activation and repression of transcription.
ENCODE examined chromosomal locations for up to 12 his- tone modiﬁcations and variants in 46 cell types.
Taking advan- tage of the wealth of datasets from ENCODE, Dong et al. established a novel quantitative model to evaluate the relation- ship between chromatin features (including 11 histone modiﬁ- cations, one histone variant and DNase I hypersensitivity) and expression levels.
Using this model, they predicted expression status and expression levels with high accuracy by employing different groups of chromatin features [16]. Transcription factor binding sites Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription by binding to speciﬁc DNA elements such as promoters, enhanc- ers, silencers, insulators and locus control regions.
To predict and identify TF binding sites throughout genomes is essential for understanding gene regulation [17]. So far, ENCODE has sampled 119 of 1800 known TFs in a limited number of cell  138 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 135 141 types.
Predicted TF binding sites on human promoters from ChIP-seq data in conjunction with position weight matrix (PWM) searches of known motifs were mutated to assess their function using luciferase reporter assays in four different immortalized human cell lines.
Overall, 70% of the binding sites functionally contributed to promoter activity.
These bind- ing sites were more conserved and located closer to TSSs than those whose function was not experimentally veriﬁed [18]. Three pairs of genomic regions were categorized according to the binding patterns of 117 TFs in ﬁve cell lines: active and inactive binding regions, promoter-proximal and gene-dis- tal regulatory modules, and high and low occupancy of tran- scription-related factors.
Intricate differences were revealed in these regions in terms of chromosomal locations, chromatin features, binding factors and cell-type speciﬁcity. 13,539 poten- tial enhancers were further identiﬁed from the distal regulatory modules, many of which were validated experimentally [19]. Furthermore, based on their contribution to the regulation of gene expression, TFs were roughly classiﬁed into six differ- ent categories, including sequence-speciﬁc TFs, general or nonspeciﬁc TFs, chromatin structure factors, chromatin remodeling factors, histone methyltransferases and Pol3-asso- ciated factors [20]. Binding of different categories of TF varied substantially in their contributions to predicting gene expres- sion sequence-speciﬁc TFs were signiﬁcantly more predictive than proteins in other groups, whereas Pol3-associated factors were signiﬁcantly less predictive [20]. Many eukaryotic genes are coregulated by multiple TFs in a cell-type speciﬁc manner [21]. Two scenarios could occur in site-speciﬁc TF partners: two TFs bind to neighboring sites (cobinding) or one TF binds to another TF, which then binds to DNA (tethered binding). An integrative analysis of 457 ChIP-seq datasets on 119 human TFs identiﬁed 151 potential tethered binding pairs and 104 cobinding sequence-speciﬁc TF pairs.
Among them, 27 cobinding pairs had physical inter- actions and 18 of 151 tethered binding pairs were validated by the mammalian two-hybrid data [22]. TCF7L2, a TF linked to a variety of human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer, repressed transcription when tethered to the genome via GATA3 in MCF7 cells [23]. The ensemble of TF binding in a combinatorial fashion forms a regulatory network to specify the on-and-off states of genes and constitutes the writing dia- gram for a cell.
Multiple expectation maximization (EM) for motif elicitation (MEME) analysis identiﬁed three signiﬁ- cantly-enriched DNA sequence motifs (HSF1, ESRRA and CEBPB) at PPARGIA-occupied sites in human HepG2 cells.
The binding relationships among these three motifs, PPARG- C1A, and three additional known co-regulators (HNF4A, NR3C1 and NRF2) formed a highly connected network, sug- gesting complex patterns of interdependent regulation [24]. In summary, in addition to discovering many novel networks, highly cell-type-speciﬁc regulatory networks that recapitulated many known regulatory sub-networks were also revealed by co-association networks of TFs [25]. Integration of genomic parts Gene regulation at functional elements is governed by inter- play of nucleosome remodeling, histone modiﬁcations and TF binding (Figure 1). Binding of TFs to regulatory DNA regions in place of canonical nucleosomes triggers chromatin remodeling.
Such binding and remodeling lead to nuclease hypersensitivity, which forms an open chromatin environment and in turn facilitates the interplay of functional elements.
Therefore, integrating analyses of these functional elements can interpret the gene regulation more accurately.
Binding of regulatory factors to genomic DNA protects the underlying sequences from cleavage by DNase I, thus leaving nucleotide-resolution footprints [12]. A striking enrichment of motifs, including known motifs and hundreds of novel evo- lutionarily-conserved motifs, was detected within footprints in 41 cell types examined.
Many of the motifs in footprints dis- play highly cell type selective occupancy patterns that are sim- ilar to major developmental and tissue-speciﬁc regulators [12]. Highly stereotyped, asymmetrical pattern of DNase I hyper- sensitivity and H3K4me3 modiﬁcation was invariant across cell types at the TSSs, and was used to predict 44,853 putative novel promoters [12]. Both TF binding and histone modiﬁcation are predictive of gene expression levels [26]. They are highly enriched at the TSS regions and can be predicted accurately by each other [20]. It is well known that transcription has a profound impact on nucle- osome occupancy.
ENCODE data indicated that TF binding sites were detected in GC-rich, nucleosome-depleted and DNase I sensitive regions, which were ﬂanked by well-posi- tioned nucleosomes. Interestingly, many of these features exhi- bit cell type speciﬁcity. These results from TF-centered analyses were deposited and visualized in a web-accessible tool called Factorbook (http://factorbook.org) [22]. Furthermore, the regulatory interactions between TFs and miRNAs constitute an additional layer of information to investigate the gene regulation of complexity.
Correlating co- associations of 119 TFs with miRNAs from ENCODE, Ger- stein et al. found that highly-connected TFs tend to regulate more miRNAs and to be more regulated by miRNAs as well [25]. Moreover, correlation between occupancy of CTCF, a ubiquitously expressed polyfunctional in gene expression, and DNA methylation was detected using ChIP- seq and RRBS data sequenced in multiple cell lines including normal primary cells and immortal lines.
DNA methylation occurring at two critical positions within the CTCF recogni- tion sequence represses CTCF binding.
Unexpectedly, CTCF binding patterns in normal cells were remarkably different from those in immortal cells.
In immortal cells, a widespread disruption of CTCF binding was noticed, which was associ- ated with increased methylation [27]. regulator Three-dimensional space interaction The spatial organization of chromosomes brings genes and their regulatory elements, which may be dispersed over many hundreds of kilobases, in close proximity to facilitate their communication and further regulate gene expression [28]. These long-range interactions between genomic elements can be detected using chromosome conformation capture (3C)- based methods [29]. Using a 3C-carbon copy (5C) approach, ENCODE comprehensively interrogated interactions between TSSs and distal elements in 1% of the human genome, repre- senting 44 ENCODE pilot types (GM12878, K562 and HeLa-S3) [30]. More than 1000 long- range interactions were generated in each cell line from 628 TSS-containing restriction fragments and 4535 distal restric- in three cell regions  Qu H and Fang X / A Brief Review on ENCODE Project 139 Figure 1 Multi-dimensional regulation of gene expression The transcriptional regulation is controlled by complicated interactions between regulatory elements.
Hypermethylated CpGs are located in close chromatin regions, whereas CpGs located in open regions are generally lowly methylated, where DHSs and histone modiﬁcations associated with transcriptional activity are enriched.
Within DHSs, DNase I cleavage leaves footprints where TFs bind to protect the DNA from cleavage by DNase I. SNP occurring at the TF recognition sequence (motif) will affect TF binding occupancy.
Furthermore, distal DHSs harboring disease-associated SNPs can be brought into proximity with a promoter to incorporate TF binding complex to affect gene function through long range chromosomal interaction.
Multiple TFs interact to DNA by two scenarios: TFs bind to neighboring sites (cobinding), and one TF binds to another that binds to DNA (tethered binding). tion fragments.
Among them, 60% were observed in only one of the three cell lines, indicating intricate cell-type-speciﬁc three-dimensional folding of chromatin.
Constitutive looping interactions were signiﬁcantly enriched for distal fragments that are bound by CTCF, contain open chromatin and/or con- tain histones with active modiﬁcations. Enhancers that loop to TSSs are signiﬁcantly more likely to express enhancer RNAs than enhancers that do not.
Long-range interactions displayed marked asymmetry with elements located around 120 kb up- stream of the TSS, revealing an unanticipated directionality in long-range interactions with TSS. However, an overwhelm- ing number of interactions ( 93%) do not occur between ele- ments and the nearest TSS. Finally, promoters and distal elements are engaged in multiple long-range interactions to  140 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 135 141 form complex networks with cell-to-cell variation.
These in- sights will be critical for interpreting the regulations of regula- tory elements with their distally located target genes.
of human phenotypes from normal developmental processes are future greater challenges.
Integration with disease-associated variation Although GWAS studies have generated a large number (approximately 10,000 as of April, 2013) of SNPs that were associated with phenotypes, they do not offer any direct evi- dence about the biological processes that link the associated variant to the phenotype.
Moreover, 88% of those variants from GWAS studies fall outside of coding regions and have been difﬁcult to interpret [31]. Integrating functional elements generated by ENCODE, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) information and disease-associated SNPs from GWAS studies, Schaub et al. proposed a systemic approach to identify a functional SNP for up to 80% of previously-reported GWAS associations [32]. They further developed a novel database, RegulomeDB, to guide interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome by integrating a large collection of reg- ulatory information [33]. Maurano et al. demonstrated that 77% (3930) of the disease or trait-associated SNPs lie within DHSs or are in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNPs in a nearby DHS, and 296 of them were assigned a target promoter [34]. Disease-associated SNPs can directly affect TF binding.
Ni et al. identiﬁed dozens of novel SNPs that affect TF binding de novo and accurately from ChIP-seq data gener- ated in the ENCODE project, which enabled us to examine al- lele-speciﬁc TF binding in any cell type with ChIP-seq data available even without pre-existing genotype data from the HapMap project and the 1000 Genomes Project [35]. These ef- forts demonstrate which variants have potential or demon- strated regulatory functions and through which mechanisms those functions might work.
Conclusion The transcriptional regulation is controlled by complex inter- actions between the DNA sequence and transcription factors, as well as nucleosomes, histone tail modiﬁcations and DNA methylation. Such interactions work complexly and dynami- cally across different types of cells.
ENCODE has provided us an unprecedented number of functional elements as well as many novel aspects of gene expression and regulation, which signiﬁcantly enhances our understanding of the human genome and human health and disease.
However, some of the mapping efforts are about halfway to completion, not to mention that deeper characterization of everything the genome does is probably only 10% ﬁnished [1]. A third phase is getting under way now and will ﬁll in many of the blanks of human genome by adding additional factors, modiﬁcations and cell types [1]. Although current assays can be expanded to capture more TFs in more cell lines, they provide only a single snapshot of cellular regulatory events without capturing the dynamic aspects of gene regulation.
The development of new technologies to capture multiple data types, along with their regulatory dynamics in single cell, would help to tackle these issues.
