Methods: The inotropic effect of methanol extract of Desmodium gangeticum root was investigated on isolated frog heart and further analyzed the physiological and biochemical effects in isolated rat hearts.
Global ischemia (30min) and reperfusion (45min) were modeled in-vitro condition by using Langendorff perfusion apparatus.
Results: Our results indicate that methanol extract of Desmodium gangeticum root showed a dose dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic effect on isolated frog heart and mimetic acetylcholine like action.
In the isolated rat heart model for ischemia reperfusion injury, the results from different biochemical and physiologi-cal effect of Desmodium gangeticum root suggested the cardio-protective nature of the herbal extract that acts similar to acetylcholine (G protein agonist).
Moreover, GS/MS result of Desmodium gangeticum root shows the presence of 4-[2-(dimeth-ylamino) ethyl] phenol, a G protein agonist and-asarone, a potent antioxidant.
Conclusions: The above results suggest that Desmodium gangeticum root extract mediates the cardio protection in ischemic reperfusion injury model in rat heart through negative inotropic and chronotropic effect by stimulating the G coupled receptors similar to the action of acetylcholine.

Kurian et al.84 Introduction Several endogenous mediators are released during ische-mic reperfusion that could potentially modulate intracel-lular signaling by acting on surface membrane receptors or on intracellular components of signaling pathways.
The endogenous protective mechanism against ische-mic reperfusion mediated by ischemic precondition is receptor mediated and initiated by stimulation of several Gi protein-coupled receptors including adenosine A1/A3, bradykinin B2, and opioid d receptors.
[1] On the other hand there are some Gi-coupled receptors on myocardial cells that are capable of triggering a preconditioned sta-te, but agonists for them are either simply not released or are released in insufficient quantity to impart protection during preconditioning ischemia.
One such receptor is the muscarinic M2 receptor.
Previous report on muscari-nic receptor stimulation by acetylcholine predict the re-duction of myocardial infract size in dog and rabbit mo-dels of ischemic reperfusion.
[2] The root of Desmodium gangeticum (DG), has been re-ported in the ancient Indian medicinal literature with be-neficial effects in heart diseases.
[3] In recent times, ex-perimental studies have shown that the root of DG has significant protective effects in ischemic heart disease.
[4] Moreover, few recent studies from our laboratories suggest the protective nature of DG against ischemic re-perfusion injury (IRI).
[5] However, the exact mecha-nism of its cardio-protective effects, in respect to the present knowledge of the patho-physiology of IRI, is not well investigated.
The present study was designed to in-vestigate the cardio tonic effect of methanol extract of DG root in isolated frog heart and to evaluate how inot-ropic changes can modulates the mitochondrial and sar-coplasmic ATPase function in an isolated rat heart.
An understanding of the mechanisms involved in these res-ponses not only informs us of how the heart reacts to injurious stimuli, but may provide avenues for develo-ping novel protective strategies applicable in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion.
Methods and materials Collection of Plant The plant, after collection from the herbal garden was washed, cleaned and maintained in the department.
Des-modium gangeticum (DC) (Leguminosae) was taxono-mically identified by Prof. James Joseph, Head of the Department, Department of Botany, Saint Berchmans College, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala.
The vo-ucher specimen A/C no.
3908 was retained in our labo-ratory for future reference.
Preparation of methanol extract of roots of Desmodium gangeticum One kilogram (1 kg) of fresh secondary roots of DG were sliced and air-dried at room temperature.
The sliced, air-dried roots of the plant were milled into fine powder in a warring commercial blender.
The powdered plant mate-rial was soaked in 2L methanol for 72 hrs and the extract was filtered and distilled on a water bath.
The last traces of the solvent were removed under vacuum drier and the solid brown mass obtained was stored at 4C until furt-her use.
The yield of the extract was 6.1% w/w of powde-red methanol extract.
Drug preparations i) Methanol extract 1 g portions of the lyophilized extract was treated with 0.2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and then the mixture was topped up with 0.8ml of Frog Ringers so-lution to give a stock solution of 1g/ ml, from which the following serial dilutions were made: 100mg/ml, 20mg/ ml, 2mg/ml, 1mg/ml, 0.2mg/ml, and 0.02mg/ml.
ii) Acetylcholine A stock solution of 10mg/ml was made with Frog Ringers solution.
The following working concentrati-ons were prepared from the stock: 1mg/ml and 0.1mg/ml.
iii) Atropine A stock solution of 10mg/ml was made with Frog Ringers solution.
The following working concentrati-ons were prepared from the stock: 1mg/ml and 0.1mg/ ml.
0.5 ml of this concentration was added to the bath and used as an antagonism of muscarinic receptor.
Chemicals DL isocitrate and N-Phenyl-P-Phenylenediamine were purchased from Acros organics, New Jersy USA.
Acetyl-choline, Atropine, Cytochrome C & ATP were purcha-sed from sigma chemical Co., St. Louis, MO USA.
All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.
Animals Frogs of Rana hexadactyla species maintained in the animal house and male Wistar albino rats (150 to 200 g) housed in cages and were maintained in controlled tem-perature at 232C with 12hr.
light/ dark cycle were used for the studies.
The animals were fed with food and water ad libitum.
The animals were maintained as per the norms of CPCSEA and the experiments were cle-ared by CPCSEA and the local ethics committee (Reg No.
and date 48/SASTRA/IAEC/RDP, dated 16/6/2009).
Experimental Protocol I Frog heart in situ preparation Frog hearts were isolated from specimens of Rana hexa-dactyla [weighing 22.015 1.2 g (mean SE)] and con-nected to a perfusion apparatus as previously described [6].
Experiments were done at room temperature (18 21C).
The hearts were perfused with frog-Ringer solu-tion containing NaCl 6.5g, KCl 0.14g, CaCl2 0.12g, and NaHCO2 0.2g, NaH2PO4 0.01g, Glucose 2.0g in g. per li-ter.
The force of contraction was recorded and the rate of contraction was counted and tabulated.
Turk J Biochem, 2010; 35 (2) ; 8390.
Kurian et al.85 Experimental protocol II The rats were divided into three groups, as follows: Gro-up 1, the control group; group 2, reperfusion; and gro-up 3, drug.
Group 1: Normal control In normal control group, hearts (n=6) were perfused for 90 minutes with KH buffer and used for the biochemi-cal analysis.
Group 2: Reperfusion In reperfusion group, after the proper stabilization peri-od, the 30 minutes ischemic hearts (n=6 in each sub gro-ups) were subjected to 30 minutes reperfusion (2.1) and 45 minutes reperfusion (2.2) respectively.
Group 3: Drug The animals in the drug group were subdivided into 5 groups.
Group 3.1: Rats (n=6) in this groups were pretreated orally (through ball tipped classic steel 15-16 gauge hypodermic needle) with DG at a dose of 100mg/kg b. wt.
for thirty days Hearts were perfused for 90 minutes with KH buffer and used for the biochemical analysis.
In group 3.2 and 3.3, rats (n=6) were pretreated orally (through ball tipped classic steel 15-16 gauge hypoder-mic needle) with DG at a dose of 100mg/kg b. wt.
for thirty days.
After equilibration and proper stabilization period, hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion and 30 minutes of global ischemia followed by 45 minutes of re-perfusion respectively.
In group 3.4 and 3.5, a similar procedure was followed as above except, instead of DG a standard drug verapa-mil (0.2 mg/kg b.wt.)
was used.
Heart Preparation Wistar male rats weighing 250-280 g were anestheti-zed with 40 mg/kg sodium thiopentenone.
After an int-ravenous injection of 300U heparin, the heart was ra-pidly excised via a mid-sternal thoracotomy and arres-ted in the ice cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KH) contai-ning (mM/L) NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, MgSO41.2, KH2PO4 1.2, CaCl2 1.8, NaHCO3 25 and C6H12O6 11.
The heart was attached to a Langendorff apparatus via an aorta for ret-rograde perfusion with KH buffer maintained at 37C and pH = 7.4 and saturated with a gas mixture of 95% O2 5% CO2.
The coronary perfusion pressure was mainta-ined at 80 mm Hg.
the left ventricular pressure develo-ped with the ventricle filled with Krebs solution.
The left ventricular pressure developed with ventricle filled with Kreb solution was recorded with a pressure transducer, which in turn was connected to a device amplifier and chart recorder.
This left ventricular pressure gave an in-dication of the mechanical performance of the heart.
Co-ronary flow was measured simply by collecting the per-fusate draining from the heart in a graduated cylinder for a defined time.
The heart rate was measured by coun-ting the number of contractions (obtained from the left ventricular pressure record) per minute.
Tissue Preparation The heart was excised, rinsed in ice cold isotonic sali-ne, blotted with filter paper, weighed, homogenized in 0.1M Tris HCl (pH 7.4) buffer solution.
The homoge-nate was centrifuged at 300*g for 5 minutes.
The super-natant was used for the estimation of various biochemi-cal parameters.
Biochemical assays Mitochondria and microsomal fractions from the myo-cardium was isolated by the method of Johnson and Lardy [7], and Schenkman and Ciniti [8], respectively.
Assay of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) [9], malate dehydrogenase (MDH) [10], succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) [11], a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (a-KGDH) [12], NADH dehydrogenase (NADH dH) [13] and cytochrome c oxides [14] were carried out in a UV-1601 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.
Protein concentration was measured with Folin phenol reagent, following the procedure described by Lowry.
[15] Assay of creatine ki-nase,[16] lactate dehydrogenase [17] and aspartate tran-saminase [18] were also estimated.
GS/MS Analysis All analysis was conducted with a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 GC equipped with mass spectrometry.
The chroma-tographic conditions were as follows: Column: Elite-1 (100% dimethyl polysiloxane).
Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1ml/minute.
The 1mL met-hanol root extract of DG was injected into the GSMS in split less mode at 250C.
The column oven tempera-ture was held at 110C for 2 minutes, then programmed at 75C/min to 200C for 1 min, 5C/ min to 280C and held for 9 minutes.
Statistical analysis: All data were reported as mean SD.
Results were statistically analyzed by a one-way analysis of vari-ance (ANOVA) by SPSS software 12.00, followed by Duncans multiple range test (DMRT).
P< 0.05 was con-sidered to be significant.
Results Recording of inotropic and chronotropic ef-fects The baseline reading of cardiac flow rate, heart rate and force of contraction were found to be changed with ext-ract, acetylcholine and atropine (Table 1).
The negati-ve ionotropic and chronotropic effect shown by the ext-ract followed a dose dependent change (1mg, 4mg, 8mg) and the maximum response was produced by 8mg of the extract.
However, the decreased heart rate and force of contractions were recovered partially when 50microg-rams of atropine was administered along with the ext-ract (Fig 1).
Similarly when Ach was treated after atropi-ne, the heart rate and force of contraction again declined.

Physiological and biochemical changes in myocardial ischemia reperfusion in isolated rat heart Table 2 shows the hemodynamic changes in the rat heart subjected to ischemia and reperfusion.
A significant fall in the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, coronary flow rate, left ventricular developed pressure and rate pres-sure products were observed in myocardial ischemia re-Table 1.

Kurian et al.87 to negate the atropine (50mg) action.
This difference in concentration for DG and Ach may be due to the nature its purity.
In fact, reversion of physiological response of atropine by DG extract re-confirms the muscarinic re-ceptor mediated action of the herbal extract.
In fact our GS/MS results reveals the presence of 4-[2-(dimethyla-mino)ethyl] phenol (Fig 2) a known G protein coupled receptor agonist.
[19] Acetylcholine has for long been known as a transmitter that has the property of lowering the blood pressure and also bringing about bradycardia through its muscarinic receptor.
[20] Importantly, supp-ressed parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) functi-on has been found in a variety of cardiovascular dise-ases, such as hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes.
Cardiac regulation by the PSNS is primarily mediated by the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.
[21] Pretre-atment of the animal with atropine significantly reduced hypotensive and negative chronotropic activities of the extract.
On the contrary, some other studies on perfu-sed heart have reported coronary vasoconstriction [22] and increase myocardial contractility by acetylcholine.
The positive ionotropic and coronary vaso-constriction effect of ACh on isolated rat heart are modulated by the release of prostaglandins and NO, and both actions are muscarinic receptor mediated.
[23] Isolated rat heart model was used to evaluate the cardio protection stimulated by cardiotonic effect of the ext-ract.
Hemodynamic variables like left ventricular deve-loped pressure, mean arterial pressure and rate pressu-re product were depressed in ischemia reperfusion cont-rol.
But administration of DG remarkable recovery of perfused myocardium.
Administration of DG and vera-pamil, calcium channel blocker, had improved the he-matological parameters to a near normal value showing cardio protective effect.
Similarly mitochondrial enz-ymes and microsomal enzymes like ICDH, SDH, MDH, aKGDH, NADH dH cytochrome c oxidase, Na+K+ AT-Pase, Ca2+ ATPase and Mg2+ ATPase were observed to be depressed in their activity (Table 3 and 4) during isc-hemia reperfusion.
However, supplementation of Tab-le V shows the level of cardiac marker enzymes in tis-sue homogenate and perfusate.
In ischemia reperfusion control rats, increased level of these enzymes in tissue homogenate and perfusate indicate severity of damage to myocardial membrane.
However, administration of DG before reperfusion preserved cardiac marker enz-ymes in both tissue homogenate and perfusate.
Discussions Our results from this study indicates that methanol ext-ract of DG stimulate cardiac muscarinic receptors the-reby mediates its protection against ischemia reperfusi-on injury in rat heart.
The kymogram results (Table 1, Fig 1) indicate negative ionotropic and chronotropic ef-fect of DG extract similar to the response mediated by acetylcholine (Ach) in frog heart.
This physiological res-ponse was reversed by the addition of acetylcholine re-ceptor/muscarinic receptor antagonist namely atropine, suggesting methanol extract of DG mediate its action through Ach receptor/ muscarinic receptor, a G protein receptor activator.
However the concentration required by DG (160mg) was more as compared to Ach (500ng) Figure 2.
GC Mass spectrum for methanol extract of Desmodium gangeticum root Turk J Biochem, 2010; 35 (2) ; 8390.
Kurian et al.88 hemodynamic variables (Table 2).
This result indicate a possible similarity in their mode of action towards the physiological response on heart as observed in frog he-art.
Table 3 shows the effect of DG root methanol extract on mitochondrial enzymes.
Mitochondrial enzyme (ICDH, MDH, SDH, NADH dH, cytochrome c oxidase) showed a significant decrease (P<0.05) in their activity.
Expe-rimental evidences suggested that when the myocardi-um becomes ischemic, the resulting hypoxia prevents oxidative phosphorylation, and consequently resulted in decreased tissue ATP concentrations and increased AMP and phosphate concentrations.
However these enz-ymes recovered their activities by the administration of DG.
Previous report suggested acetylcholine (muscari-nic agonist) mediated protective action against infarcti-on [24] and is dependent on mitochondrial K(ATP) chan-nel opening.
Significantly improved activity of mitoc-hondrial enzymes in DG pretreated rat heart indicates the possibility of mitochondria mediated action by DG root extract.
In addition,-asarone present in the ext-ract (Fig 2) exhibits characteristic antioxidant properties, [25] as well as acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.
[26] Even though administration of the standard drug, verapamil improves mitochondrial enzyme function; its effect was not as significant as DG extract.
This may be due to the presence of free radical scavenging molecu-les along with cardio-stimulant biomolecules in DG ext-ract (Fig 2).
Physiological dysfunction of rat heart during ischemic reperfusion is predominantly due to the disturbances in ionic balance.
Microsomal ATPase analyzed in the pre-sent study (Table 4) showed an improved activities in DG extract treated rat heart as compared to ischemia reper-fusion control.
Trautween and Dudel, [27] were among the first to suggested that the action of acetylcholine on cardiac muscle involves a specific increase of membra-ne permeability of K+.
Further, atropine antagonism of Ach produced arrest observed in kymogram result may be linked to the inhibition of both Ach induced sodium influx and K+ out flux from atrial tissue.
[28] Hence the improved Na+K+ ATPase (Table 4) by the DG extract in the present study reemphasizes the acetylcholine like ac-tion by DG extract.
Similarly, the improved Ca2+ATPase (Table 4) activity and reduced cardiac marker enzymes in myocardial perfusate (Table 5) indicates an improved Table 2.

Kurian et al.89 Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile protein that is essential to cardiac contractility.
Myocardial injury was assessed by estimating the activity of cardiac markers in both heart tissue and perfusate.
Higher cardiac marker enzyme ac-tivity in the tissue perfusate of ischemia reperfused rat heart indicates the myocardial injury.
On the other hand low activity of the above enzyme in perfusate as well as tissue homogenate of rat heart pretreated with drug pre-dicts the cardio-protective nature of drug.
The decreased level of above enzymes in the perfusate and tissue (Tab-le 5) substantiate the cardio-protection of the extract.
We conclude from the above observation that DG metha-nol extract mediates its cardio protection in isolated rat heart during ischemia reperfusion by eliciting the action of muscarinic receptor.
