In early 1950s, cellular reprogramming was ﬁrst achieved using the technique of so- matic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which transferred the nu- clear of thus converted the mature somatic cells into pluripotent state.
Using this technique, Xenopus laevis and the famous sheep  Dolly  were cloned successfully in 1960s and 1990s, respec- tively. Following that, many other species have been cloned via the SCNT technique, and the mechanisms underlying cellu- lar reprogramming have been extensively studied.
into an enucleated oocyte, After SCNT, another breakthrough in cell fate conversion was achieved in 2006, with the Japanese scientist Yamanaka and his colleagues demonstrated that mouse ﬁbroblasts could be reprogrammed into pluripotent state by exogenous expres- sion of four transcriptional factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. Those induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have equiv- alent properties to embryonic stem (ES) cells, which can go indeﬁnite self-renewal and can differentiate into various cell types of three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Subse- quently, human iPS cells were also generated successfully, which were considered to have great clinical application poten- tial for their promise to overcome the ethic and immune-rejec- tion obstacles faced by ES cells.

Since 2006, iPS cells have become one of the most attrac- tive and competitive ﬁelds in life science research, many important progresses have been made during the past few years.
Besides the early stage retrovirus transfection method for exogenous gene expression, various new approaches have been demonstrated to generate iPS cells successfully, includ- ing using non-integrative vectors, mRNAs or chemicals.
These new methods have the potential to reduce the tumori- genesis risk of iPS cells by avoiding the genomic mutations caused by retroviruses, although the pluripotency of iPS cells produced by some of these methods still need to be further conﬁrmed. The immunogenicity of iPS cells is still a controversial issue.
It was reported that iPS cells are immunogenic post transplan- tation, which may be caused by mutations during the repro- gramming and long time in vitro culture process.
However, there were also controversial reports about non-immunogenic iPS cells.
It is critical to prevent or reduce the potential immu- nogenicity of human iPS cells post transplantation before applying them in clinical therapies.
Using approaches similar to the iPS technique, scientists have been able to convert one type of differentiated somatic cells into another type, without going through the pluripotent stage.
This technique, named trans-differentiation, is consid- ered to be less tumorigenic than the iPS approach, as the resulting cells are non-pluripotent. Nevertheless, how to pre- cisely control the fate of reprogrammed cells to generate well differentiated and functional cells is a major task for all cell reprogramming techniques.
And the therapeutic effects of either human iPS cells or their derivatives still need to be carefully investigated before some clinical trials could be launched.
