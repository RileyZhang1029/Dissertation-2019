Motivation: Antibodies are able to recognize a wide range of antigens through their complementary determining regions formed by six hypervariable loops.
Predicting the 3D structure of these loops is essential for the analysis and reengineering of novel antibodies with enhanced affinity and specificity.
The canonical structure model allows high accuracy prediction for five of the loops.
The third loop of the heavy chain, H3, is the hardest to predict because of its diversity in structure, length and sequence composition.
Results: We describe a method, based on the Random Forest automatic learning technique, to select structural templates for H3 loops among a dataset of candidates.
These can be used to predict the structure of the loop with a higher accuracy than that achieved by any of the presently available methods.
The method also has the advantage of being extremely fast and returning a reliable estimate of the model quality.

Received on January 24, 2014; revised on March 27, 2014; accepted on April 4, 2014 1 INTRODUCTION Antibodies are a class of Y-shaped proteins produced by B-cells that the immune system uses to identify and neutralize foreign pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.
They have the remarkable ability to recognize virtually any foreign targets (the antigens) and bind to these with extraordinary affinity and specificity (Mian et al., 1991; Sliwkowski and Mellman, 2013).
These characteristics make antibodies an ideal tool for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as cancer, infectious and cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, inflammation, immune disorders as well as for biotechnological applications (Mian et al., 1991; Sliwkowski and Mellman, 2013).
Knowing the structure of antibodies is clearly instrumental for gaining insights into the biological phenomena of the antibodyantigen recognition as well as to interpret clinical data and rationally redesign the molecule for medical and biotechnological purposes (Ghiotto et al., 2011; Zibellini et al., 2010).
Antibodies are composed of two identical heavy and light chain pairs.
The antigen binding site, present on the upper tips of the Y shape, is formed by six hypervariable (HV) loops also referred to as the complementary determining regions (CDRs).
Three of the loops belong to the variable domain of the light chain, (L1, L2 and L3) and three to the variable domain of the heavy chain (H1, H2 and H3).
The variability in these CDR loops in terms of loop length and amino acid compositions is the main reason of the antibody capability to bind many different antigens.
The framework regions of antibodies are fairly well conserved, while the structural variations occur mostly in the CDR loops.
We and others have developed effective methods to predict the structure of antibodies (Choi and Deane, 2010, 2011; Sircar et al., 2009; Sivasubramanian et al., 2009).
The strategy consists of modeling the framework by homology while the prediction of five of the six loops is based on the canonical structure (CS) model that states that these loops (the light chains loops and the H1 and H2 loops of the heavy chain) can only assume a limited number of conformations and that these are determined by the presence of key residues in specific positions in the sequence of the antibody (Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Tramontano et al., 1990).
According to a recent blind assessment of the prediction accuracy of antibody modeling (Almagro et al., 2011), a good prediction can be obtained for non-H3 loops with an average root-mean square deviation (RMSD) of their C atoms close to 1 A.
Only a partial CS model exists for the H3 loop, which allows the prediction of the structure of its four N-terminal and six C-terminal residues closer to the framework (Kuroda et al., 2008; Morea et al., 1998; Shirai et al., 1996).
Accordingly, the prediction accuracy for H3 loops is not equally satisfactory as for the other loops, an important drawback because the H3 loop is central in the binding site and therefore often essential in determining the antibodyantigen interactions.
In the above mentioned assessment (Almagro et al., 2011), none of the tested methods was able to provide sufficiently good predictions for H3; the average RMSD for the best methods was 3 A.
The high variability in length, structure and sequence of this loop is usually invoked as the main reason behind the difficulty of predicting its structure.

One of the most used approaches for antibody structure prediction is Rosetta Antibody (RA; Sircar et al., 2009; Sivasubramanian et al., 2009), which combines template selections with ab initio CDR H3 loop modeling (using loop fragments) and simultaneous optimization of the CDR loop conformations and Variable Light (VL)-Variable Heavy (VH) orientations.
Another interesting approach is FREAD (Choi and Deane, 2010, 2011), which attempts to predict antibody loops using local similarities (local sequence and geometric matches).
FREAD uses environment-specific substitution scores (Choi and Deane, 2010; Kelm et al., 2010; Lee and Blundell, 2009) to identify the best fragments for building the structure of the loops.
Each of the previous approaches has its own disadvantages and limitations, and this prompted us to develop the method described here.
One of the main limitations of ab initio approaches (e.g.RA) is due to our incomplete understanding of the physicochemical principles governing protein structures, which leads to the employment of pseudo-energy approximate functions that are not always accurate in distinguishing correct predictions.
In addition ab initio approaches tend to have high computational cost.
On the other hand, the available homologybased methods such as FREAD-S (Choi and Deane, 2011) suffer from being essentially dependent on the H3 sequence alone that has proven to be insufficient to provide accurate models, especially for longer loops.
The ConFREAD method (Choi and Deane, 2011) tried to overcome this limitation by including contact profile information; however, this only led to minor improvements obtained at the expense of a much lower coverage.
Given the central position of the H3 region in the antigenbinding site, there are several interactions with the other CDR loops, as well as with the framework, that could affect the conformation of H3 (Morea et al., 1998).
In line with this hypothesis, we developed a method that takes advantage of sequence similarity and structural related features [e.g.CS (Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Tramontano et al., 1990) as well as a score reflecting the likelihood of the presence/absence of specific interactions between the H3 residues and the rest of the modeled antibody structure (Tung et al., 2007)].
We used a set of selected features to train a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to select the closest loop among a dataset of H3 loops present in immunoglobulins of known structure.
The best predicted template(s) are used to build the structure of H3 that are subsequently ranked according to their intramolecular interactions.
We tested our model on the RA benchmark (Sivasubramanian et al., 2009) (we used 53 of the 54 structures in the benchmark excluding the PDB: 2AI0 case because in RA benchmark the H3 loop was uncorrectly reported as a six-residue loop) and our results are more accurate than those provided by RA, considered the best method available at present, on the same benchmark.
We also tested our method on recently deposited structures of antibodies with equally satisfactory results.
Last but not least the described method requires substantially less computing time with respect to the RA (on average 5min).
2 METHODS 2.1 Datasets We scanned the sequences of all proteins in the PDB database (October 15, 2012) using isotype-specific Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles (Chailyan et al., 2012; Lefranc et al., 2009) to retrieve the structures of 1294 antibodies.
We removed antibody molecules with resolution worse than 3 A using the PISCES web server (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003).
The resulting 1161 antibodies were clustered based on the sequence of H3 loops using the cd-hit package (Li and Godzik, 2006) with a sequence identity threshold of 90%.
One representative antibody from each cluster was selected (priority was given to antibodies that were found to be in complex with their antigen in the crystal structure, using a procedure previously developed by us (Olimpieri et al., 2013).
When this was not possible we selected the antibody with the longest H3 loop).
As a result, we were left with 401 representative non-redundant antibodies.
The alignment of H3 loops was done according to (Chailyan et al., 2012; Lefranc et al., 2003; Morea et al., 1998) where insertions were introduced in the middle of the region comprised between the conserved residues Cys92 and Gly104.
Throughout the article we use the Kabat Chothia numbering scheme (Morea et al., 1998).
2.2 RF model We used the R (v.4.6) implementation of the RF (randomForest package) and the RF regression tool to predict the 3D distance between pairs of H3-loop.
For this specific purpose, the input features of the RFmodel are the sequences of the antibody pairs along with other sequence-derived features described below.
The task of the RF model is to use these features to infer the 3D distance between each pair of H3 loops.
In other words, for each loop in the testing set, we use our trained RF model to predict the distances between the target loop and all other loops in the training dataset.
The loop predicted as the most similar to the target is used as template to build the model of the target H3.
2.3 TM-score as a similarity measurement For calculating the 3D distances between H3 loops, we used the TM-score algorithm implemented by Zhang and coworkers (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004).
The main advantage of the TM-score over the perhaps most commonly used RMSD is that the TM-score weights more shorter distances between pairs of superimposed atoms than longer ones and does not require the definition of any cutoff distance.
Moreover, the TM-score takes into considerations the difference in length between loops; hence, it is more appropriate for comparing loops of different lengths.
The TM-score between two H3 loops was calculated using the Biopython Bio.PDB module (Hamelryck andManderick, 2003) by superposing the stems of the two loops (residue H90H92 and residue H104 H106 of the heavy chain) and calculating the pairwise distance between aligned residues; such distances were then converted to a TM-score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004).
To compare our results with data available in the literature for other methods, we also computed the backbone RMSD between the selected templates and the target loops.
Throughout the article we used TMdistance (1 TM-score) to represent the 3D distances between pairs of H3 loops.

As mentioned above, only a partial CS model could be derived for the H3 loop (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Morea et al., 1998).
We used the CS of the six HV loops as variables for the RF model.
The CS information was obtained using the tool provided by the DIGIT database (Chailyan et al., 2012).
2.5 Germline families It has been advocated that the specific selected VH and VL Germline genes are essential for the understanding of the biophysical properties of antibodies (Ewert et al., 2003).
In addition, a recent paper by Chailyan and coworkers (Chailyan et al., 2011) showed that Germline families are important for the overall structure of the antibody binding sites.
Therefore, we also included the source organism and the Germline families as variables in our RF model.
2.6 BLOcks substitution matrix The BLOcks substitution matrix (BLOSUM) matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) is a substitution matrix commonly used to score alignments between evolutionary divergent protein sequences based on the local alignments of protein sequences.
We used the BLOSUM40 scores between each aligned amino acids in pairs of the H3 loops as well as the score over the whole loop as variables for the RF model.
