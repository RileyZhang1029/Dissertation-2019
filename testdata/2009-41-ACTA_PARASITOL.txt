Stefan ski Institute of Parasitology, PAS Acta Parasitologica, 2009, 54(3), 244 252  ISSN 1230-2821 New data on three gonad-infecting species of Philometra (Nematoda, Philometridae) from estuarine fishes  in South Carolina, USA František Moravec1* and Isaure de Buron2 1Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Branišovská 31, 370 05 České Budějovice, Czech Republic 2Department of Biology, College of Charleston, 58 Coming Street, Charleston, South Carolina 29401, USA Abstract The following three gonad-infecting species of Philometra Costa, 1845 (Nematoda, Philometridae) were recorded from offshore perciform fishes in South Carolina, USA: Philometra carolinensis Moravec, de Buron et Roumillat, 2006 from the southern king- fish Menticirrhus americanus (Linnaeus) (Sciaenidae) (new host record), Philometra floridensis Moravec, Fajer-Avila et Ba- kenhaster, 2009 from the red drum Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus) (Sciaenidae), and Philometra saltatrix Ramachandran, 1973 from the bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnaeus) (Pomatomidae). Findings of the first two species represent the second records since their original descriptions and P. floridensis was for the first time recorded from South Carolina estuaries.
Detailed study of these nematode species, using both light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed the presence of minute cau- dal projections in the gravid female of P. carolinensis and four pairs of caudal papillae in the conspecific male the cephalic and caudal ends of this species were for the first time examined by SEM. The related species P. carolinensis and P. floridensis, both parasitizing sciaenid fishes, can be distinguished from each other mainly by the presence/absence of oesophageal teeth, lengths of spicules and body lengths of gravid females.
The morphology of North American specimens of P. saltatrix was found to be identical with that of specimens from Europe, thus confirming their conspecificity. Keywords Parasitic nematode, Philometra, fish, Menticirrhus, Sciaenops, Pomatomus, estuary, South Carolina, USA Introduction The present knowledge of philometrid nematodes (Philome- tridae) parasitizing marine and brackish-water fishes in the western North Atlantic remains fragmentary.
It concerns the species composition, taxonomy and morphology of these im- portant fish parasites as well as the range of their hosts, host- parasite relationships, geographical distribution and life cy- cles (e.g., Clarke et al. 2006 Moravec 2006 Moravec and Sal- gado-Maldonado 2007 Moravec et al. 2007, 2008a, c Bryan et al. 2008 Moravec and de Buron 2009 Perez et al. 2009). During recent helminthological investigations of some estua- rine fishes of South Carolina, USA, three little-known gonad- infecting species of Philometra Costa, 1845 were found.
New important data on these nematodes are presented herein.
Southern kingfish Menticirrhus americanus (Linnaeus) (Sciaenidae, Perciformes) (maximum size 50 cm, weight about 1 kg), red drum Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus) (Sciaenidae, Perciformes) (maximum size up to 155 cm, weight 45 kg) and bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnaeus) (Pomatomidae, Per- ciformes) (maximum size 130 cm, weight up to 14.4 kg) are important subtropical and tropical commercial and sport fishes, inhabiting mostly coastal waters whereas both sciaenid spe- cies are distributed in the West Atlantic, P. saltatrix has a cir- cumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters (Froese and Pauly 2009). Materials and methods Fishes were captured using trammel netting in several estu- aries: southern kingfish, Menticirrhus americanus (total body length 28 32 cm) (n = 5 collected 12 June and 29 September 2008) red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus (total body length 81 113 cm) (n = 24 collected 12 September-10 October 2008) and bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (total body length 27 85 cm) (n = 9 collected 30 April and 4 May 2007, and 3 7 May 2008). The fishes were transported on ice to the laboratory in *Corresponding author: moravec@paru.cas.cz  Three gonad-infecting Philometra spp. 245 Charleston and immediately examined.
The nematodes recov- ered were washed in physiological saline and then fixed in hot 4% formaldehyde solution in saline.
For light microscopy (LM), the nematodes were cleared with glycerine. Drawings were made with the aid of a Zeiss drawing attachment.
Speci- mens used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (via phosphate buffer), de- hydrated through a graded acetone series, critical point dried and sputter-coated with platina they were examined using a JEOL JSM-7401F scanning electron microscope at an accelerat- ing voltage of 4 kV GB low.
All measurements are in micro- metres unless otherwise indicated.

Also since the site of infection (gonads) in the host is identical and the hosts of both forms, belonging to the same fish family (Sciaenidae), are sympatric in the estuaries, the spec- imens from Menticirrhus americanus are considered to belong to P. carolinensis. Small biometrical differences recorded be- tween these two forms may be considered to be within the lim- its of intraspecific variability of this species.
In contrast to the present study, Moravec et al. (2006) did not observe minute caudal papilla-like projections in P. carolinensis gravid fe- males from C. nebulosus, but these are hardly visible under the light microscope.
They reported only three pairs of caudal pa- pillae in the only available male studied by LM, whereas four pairs were found by SEM in this study the male papillae of philometrids are extremely difficult to observe by LM and these data may not be reliable.
The same number (4 pairs) and distribution of caudal papillae has recently been reported by Sokolov and Kazakov (2008) for Philometra rischta Skryabin, 1923.
On the other hand, the present specimens exhibit most characteristic taxonomic features of P. carolinensis, such as the presence of a dorsal reflect barb on the gubernaculum and dis- tinct oesophageal teeth in the gravid female, as well as the body length of the gravid female.
For the first time in this species, the male morphology has been examined by SEM this made it possible to study a de- tailed structure of the male cephalic and caudal ends.
Among gonad-infecting Philometra spp., P. carolinensis resembles only P. floridensis Moravec, Fajer-Avila et Bakenhaster, 2009 in having a dorsal reflect barb on the gubernaculum the latter species has only recently been described from another sciae- nid fish, Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus), off Florida (Gulf of Mexico), USA (Moravec et al. 2009), and subsequently it has been recorded from the same host species in South Carolina (present study). Both species differ from each other mainly in the body length of gravid females, presence/absence of oe- sophageal teeth, and in the length of spicules.
The present finding of P. carolinensis in Menticirrhus americanus represents a new host record for this nematode par- asite.

Philometra floridensis dif- fers distinctly from the most related species P. carolinensis (see above) mainly in the absence of oesophageal teeth, conspicu- ously longer spicules (138 213 µm) and much longer gravid females (nearly to 1 m). Previously this species was found in Florida, USA (Mora- vec et al. 2009). The present finding of P. floridensis in wa- ters of South Carolina represents a new geographical record, indicating that this nematode parasite is widespread in the West Atlantic, following the distribution of its fish host.

Host: Bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (Pomatomidae, Per- ciformes). Site of infection: Ovary.
Localities: Estuaries of Ashepoo-Combahee-Edisto (ACE) basin and Charleston harbour, South Carolina, USA (collected 30 April and 4 May 2007, and 3 7 May 2008). Prevalence and intensity: 56% (5 fish infected/9 fish ex- amined). Intensity ranged from 1 to several nematode speci- mens per fish.
Deposition of voucher specimens: Helminthological Col- lection of the Institute of Parasitology, BC ASCR, in České Bu-  250 František Moravec and Isaure de Buron dějovice (Cat. No.N-809) and US National Parasite Collection, Beltsville, Maryland (Cat. No.USNPC 101512). Comments: This species was inadequately described by Ramachandran (1973) from the gonads of the bluefish, Po- matomus saltatrix, off the Atlantic coast of the USA (Con- necticut) and the original description contains some inaccura- cies and evident errors.
In North America (Northwest Atlantic, USA: off New York, North Carolina and South Carolina), Philometra saltarix was later recorded from the same host spe- cies by Cheung et al. (1984), Clarke et al. (2006) and Mora- vec et al. (2008a), but no redescription of this parasite was pro- vided. Philometra saltatrix has recently been redescribed from specimens collected from P. saltatrix from the Mediterranean Sea off Italy and Turkey (Moravec and Genc 2004, Moravec et al. 2008b), but these European specimens somewhat dif- fered morphologically and biometrically from the original species description.
In contrast to Ramachandran s (1973) data, no microscopic bosses were observed on the cuticle of the male, the spicules were found to be distinctly longer than those re- ported in the original description, and the male oesophagus was conspicuously longer.
The present study shows that the mor- phology of the North American specimens of this nematode Fig.5.

Abbreviations: a  adanal subventral papilla, b  lateral postanal papilla, c  subventral postanal papilla  Three gonad-infecting Philometra spp. 251 species is identical with that of European specimens, as de- scribed by Moravec and Genc (2004) and Moravec et al. (2008b), thus confirming their conspecificity. Since only a single male specimen with a withdrawn gubernaculum was available, a detailed structure of the gubernaculum distal end could not be studied by SEM to confirm its characteristic an- nulation, previously found by Moravec et al. (2008b). A single specimen (subgravid female 15 mm long) of Phi- lometra saltatrix has already been recorded from P. saltatrix in South Carolina (Cape Romain Estuary) collected in April 2007 (Moravec et al. 2008a). The finding of much larger fe- males (up to 100 mm long) at the beginning of May suggests that P. saltatrix has a pronounced annual maturation cycle, as previously found in some other Philometra spp. of the tem- perature zone (Moravec 2006, Perez et al. 2009), that is prob- ably seasonally synchronous with the bluefish spawning cycle (Clarke et al. 2006). Conspecific with P. saltatrix is probably also Philometra sp. reported by Rego et al. (1983) from Pomatomus saltatrix off the Brazilian coast (see Cárdenas et al. 2009). According to recent information provided by Prof. Anna Kohn, she re-ex- amined the complete gravid female (containing larvae) of this material deposited in the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Ja- neiro the body length of this stained specimen mounted in Can- ada balsam was 140 mm.
However, the species identification of Brazilian specimens can only be confirmed when conspe- cific males are also available.
Discussion To date, 14 species of philometrid nematodes (Philometridae) have been reported from marine and brackish-water fishes in the western North Atlantic, including representatives of five genera: Caranginema Moravec, Montoya-Mendoza et Sal- gado-Maldonado, 2008 Dentiphilometra Moravec et Wang, 2002 Philometra Costa, 1845 Philometroides Yamaguti, 1935 and Spirophilometra Parukhin, 1971 (see Moravec 2006 Mo- ravec and de Buron 2006, 2009 González-Solís et al. 2007 Moravec et al. 2007, 2008a, c, 2009 Moravec and Salgado- Maldonado 2007). Previous records of Philometra globiceps (Rudolphi, 1819) and P. lateolabracis (Yamaguti, 1935) from marine fishes of this region (Linton 1901, 1907 Martínez and Ventosa 1982) were evidently misidentifications (see Petter and Radujković 1989, Moravec 2006). Of all species reported, only five Philometra spp. are gonad-infecting parasites, where- as all other remaining species have other locations in the host.
In addition to the three species dealt with in this paper, Philo- metra margolisi Moravec, Vidal-Martínez et Aguirre-Macedo, 1995 and P. mexicana Moravec et Salgado-Maldonado, 2007 were described from the ovaries of groupers, Epinephelus mo- rio (Valenciennes) and E. adscensionis (Osbeck), respective- ly, from the southern Gulf of Mexico (Moravec et al. 1995, Moravec and Salgado-Maldonado 2007). However, from the northern West Atlantic, unidentified philometrids have been re- ported from many fish species of different families (e.g., Lin- ton 1907, Rees 1970), so that it can be assumed that there are still many undescribed species of philometrids in this region, including those parasitizing fish gonads.
Because of a considerable morphological uniformity of phi- lometrids, especially of the gonad-infecting species, their spe- cies identification based on morphological features remains rather difficult (Moravec 2006). Nevertheless, as indicated by some recent papers (e.g., Sokolov and Kazakov 2007, 2008 Moravec et al. 2008a, b, 2009 Quiazon et al. 2008a, b) and by the present study, a detailed examination of males by SEM may prove to be very helpful.
Although the number and arrange- ment of their cephalic papillae seem to be rather uniform, there may be distinct interspecific differences in the structure of the distal tip of the gubernaculum and in the shape of lobes (mounds) on the caudal end of the body, and in the numbers and arrangement of genital papillae.
Therefore, a detailed exam- ination of males by SEM is very important for the taxonomy of philometrids. Unfortunately, most philometrid species were described solely from large-sized females, whereas minute conspecific males remain unknown.
