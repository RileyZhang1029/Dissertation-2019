The starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Family: Edwardsiidae) is a burrowing, brackish-water, solitary sea anemone with a distribution mainly along the northern Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America (1, 2). Self-sustaining laboratory cultures can be maintained year-round in artificial seawater, with daily feedings of brine shrimp (3, 4). While sexes are separate, they are not obviously morphologically distinguishable. Nematostella is unique among cnidarians in that it can be induced to spawn repeatedly on a regular cycle in the laboratory to produce large numbers of gametes that can be manipulated by simple in vitro fertilization methods (4). Fertilization is followed by cell divisions resulting in a hollow blastula, which gastrulates by invagination and ingression to produce a ciliated, tear-drop-shaped planula larva that swims with an apical tuft of sensory cilia at the front and the blastopore at the rear (Figure S1.1 a-e, h, i). On the seventh day after fertilization, the planula develops into a juvenile polyp, with the blastopore becoming the mouth (3, 5, 6) (Figure S1.1f). This metamorphosis results in a four-tentacled juvenile polyp with two mesenteries (partitions that partially Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 2 divide the gut and increase its surface area, also providing pouches for the production and storage of gametes), with sexual maturity reached in 3-4 months. Mature adults are hollow tubes typically 5-10 cm in length, with eight mesenteries and an open (oral) end encircled by 10-20 tentacles a few cm long, and a closed (aboral) end (Figure S1.1l). The animals are carnivorous, capturing and consuming plankton, including small animals and their larvae, using tentacles and the characteristic stinging cells of cnidarians, which inject neurotoxin into prey. Asexual reproduction can be induced by tying a fine thread around the body tube. Within a few days, the animal will separate into two individuals, producing both a new mouth and basal disc. As with other cnidarians, Nematostella possesses considerable regenerative abilities, reconstituting a complete and properly proportioned adult from only a part of the animal. Tentacles can also regenerate when cut. It is not known how tentacle number or body tube length is regulated, either in regeneration or embryogenesis. Voucher specimens of siblings of the original parental strain have been deposited in separate sexes at the Peabody Museum at Yale, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. The sample numbers are as follows: YPM Nos. 39180, 39181, 39182, 39183. Table S1.1 contains a partial list of the merits of Nematostella as a model organism. Figure S1.1 Methods Nematocyst staining (Figure S1.1 g): (Methods adapted from (7)) Juvenile and small adult Nematostella polyps were relaxed in 7.14% MgCl2 in dH2O for ten minutes and then washed quickly three times in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA. They were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA for one hour at 4oC. After washing three times for five minutes each in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA, the animals were stained in a 200uM DAPI solution in 1X PBS for thirty minutes. Animals were mounted in 70% glycerol in Ptw after washing three times for five minutes each in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA. In situ hybridization (Figure S1.1 j,k): In situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (8). Supplement S2: Genome sequencing and characterization Source material for genome sequencing Genomic DNA was prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau from larval F1 progeny of CH2 males and CH6 females. These parental strains clones of which are widely available today in at least four laboratories and can be readily redistributed are from the original colony established and maintained by Cadet Hand at the Bodega Bay Marine Laboratory in the early 1990’s (3).  Because commensals or symbionts have been reported for Nematostella, gametic or embryonic DNA is preferred to avoid contamination from symbionts and/or undigested food. DNA from the same preparation was used to create a BAC library, described below. Thanks to asexual reproduction, the haplotypes represented in the draft genome sequence and BAC library [see below] can be propagated indefinitely. CHORI BAC library A Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library, CHORI-219, was produced by Drs. Baoli Zhu and Pieter de Jong at the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI). This library provides a ten-fold coverage of the genome. The average size of the inserts in the library is 168 kb. Funding for construction of the library was provided by a grant from the NSF (Robert Steele, PI, Ulrich Technau, Co-PI). The library is available through the CHORI BACPAC resource (http://bacpac.chori.org).  Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 3 Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) Sequencing and Assembly. The genome of Nematostella vectensis was sequenced and assembled by whole genome shotgun (WGS) (9) as previously described (10). Briefly, genomic DNA prepared as described above was used to create shotgun libraries with inserts of approximately 3,000 bp, 6,500 bp and 35,000 bp. The libraries used, their mean insert sizes, and the numbers of reads sequenced are listed in Table S2.1. The shotgun reads were trimmed of low quality and vector-derived sequence, and assembled using JAZZ (10, 11). Approximately one third of the shotgun reads are composed entirely of high copy-number repeat sequences, and are therefore masked at the alignment stage of JAZZ, and therefore remain unassembled. Table S2.2 lists 10 abundant tandemly repeated sequences in the shotgun dataset which together account for 32% of shotgun reads. The assembled genome contains a total of 59,124 contiguous reconstructed sequences ("contigs") with a total length of 297 million base pairs (Mbp) and 10,804 "scaffolds", or reconstructed fragments of the genome that include gaps of unknown sequence, with a total length of 356 Mbp. Half of the contig sequence is contained in the largest 3,617 contigs, which are all at least 19,835 bp in length (N50). Half of the total scaffold sequence is contributed by the largest 181 scaffolds, which are each at least 472 Kbp in length. Polymorphism To avoid contamination from commensal microbes common to adult anemones and minimize the impact of allelic variation on assembly quality, we prepared genomic DNA from the larvae of a single mating pair originally isolated from the same lagoon. Our dataset thus nominally contains up to four alleles at each locus. From the shotgun assembly and the analysis of alignments between shotgun reads, we measured a rate of single nucleotide polymorphism among the four parental alleles as 0.8%, or ~1/125 bp, approximately ten times the SNP rate in the human population. Some 16,000 SNPs may be searched at the SNP browser available at StellaBase (http://stellabase.org) (12). After correcting for sampling, we estimated that each pair of alleles differs at 0.65% of nucleotide positions (Figure S2.3). Thus the parental anemones whose genomes we sampled have somewhat less allelic variation than broadcast spawning invertebrates such as sea squirts (~2%) (10) and sea urchins (5-10%) (13), or outbreeding plants like Populus (~2%) (14), but a comparable amount to the pufferfish (0.5%) (11). Nematostella, however, is not a true broadcast spawner, since while males release sperm into the water, females lay tens to hundreds of eggs encased in a jelly mass that becomes fixed to a benthic substrate. The egg mass may be a derived feature of Nematostella that is related to its colonization of the estuarine environment. The relatively low level of intra-specific genetic variation in Nematostella vs. marine broadcast spawners might be explained if its estuarine habitat limited gamete dispersal and led to a smaller effective population size. Genetic fingerprinting of wild Nematostella populations indicates a high degree of genetic structuring at fine spatial scales, implying extremely low levels of gene flow between neighboring estuaries (15). The source population for the genome sequence (Rhode River, Maryland) appears typical in this regard (16). After correcting for ascertainment bias, we estimate that 0.85% of four-fold degenerate sites in predicted proteins are polymorphic in the sampled haplotypes (Figure S2.1). Approximately 0.8% of positions in the assembly contain a polymorphic site (Figure S2.2), and we estimate that the mean pairwise variation between the four alleles represented in the libraries is 0.64 % (Figure S2.3). We estimate that no more than 5 to 10 percent of the genome is represented redundantly in the assembly due to locally higher rates of heterozygosity between alleles. This estimate is an upper bound because some apparent splits between haplotypes are likely to be recently duplicated regions (17). To arrive at this estimate we compared EST contigs to the assembly, the predicted protein sequences to one another, and the assembled scaffolds to one another. 839 (11%) of the EST contigs had alignments of at least 95% identity spanning at least 75% of their length with multiple locations in the Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 4 assembly. 4421 predicted genes share at least 99% amino acid identity with another predicted gene. If all these models are assumed to be alternate alleles, this corresponds to from 5% to 11% of loci being represented in multiple alleles. Finally, 898 randomly sampled 2 KB fragments of the assembly that did not include any sequence gaps were aligned to the whole assembly. 132, or 14.7% of the sampled sequences, had alignments of at least 90% identity, covering at least 75% of their length to 1, 2 or 3 (other) locations in the assembly. The vast majority hit a single second location in the assembly, indicating that ~ 8% of genomic loci are represented in multiple alleles in the assembly. Expressed sequence tag (EST) library preparation, sequencing, and assembly Two mixed stage cDNA libraries for Nematostella were prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau and Thomas W. Holstein, cloning polyA RNA from unfertilized eggs through metamorphosis into pSPORT 6.1 (non-normalized library) and pBS-SK(+) (normalized library). The non-normalized library contains 56 million colony-forming units (cfu) at a concentration of 4.7 million cfu/ml. The average insert size of the library is 1.96 kb, with greater than 99.5% recombinant. The normalized library was prepared from the same source of RNA has an average insert size of 0,9 kb and contains 6.5x105 cfu. In addition, several cDNA libraries were prepared from stage-specific RNA provided by Mark Q. Martindale. Detailed information about the libraries can be obtained upon request. Two mixed stage cDNA libraries for Nematostella was prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau; cloning polyA RNA from unfertilized eggs through metamorphosis into pSPORT 6.1. The library contains 56 million colony-forming units (cfu) at a concentration of 4.7 million cfu/ml. The average insert size of the library is 1.96 kb, with greater than 99.5% recombinant, and an estimated 75% full length based on pilot sequencing. Of 1,152 sample sequences, 99.9% were passing, and 80% possessed significant BLASTX hits (E-value < 1E-5). 780 contigs were produced, with 680 single clones; the most abundant sequence was EF-1a, found in 3% of the sample, indicating that even without normalization this library has a relatively low level of redundancy. To enable the characterization of gene structures and to provide resources for further study, 88,704 cDNA clones from the library were end-sequenced to provide 146,095 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The ESTs were clustered and assembled into 30,813 contigs via the JGI EST pipeline. Of these, 7,925 contigs were found to have a complete (start codon to stop codon) open reading frame (ORFs) of at least 450 bp. These putatively full-length EST contigs were aligned to the assembled WGS scaffolds using BLAT (18) (-maxIntron=100000-extendThroughN). To evaluate the completeness of the WGS assembly with respect to this collection of ESTs, we considered the number of putative full length EST contigs aligned to the genome at varying levels of completeness. For alignments of at least 95% sequence identity, 7,738 (97.6%) had an alignment spanning at least 25% of the length of the EST contig, 7,557 (95.4%) had an alignment spanning at least 75% of the length of the EST contig, and 7,193 (90.8%) had an alignment spanning at least 95% of the length of the EST contig. 138 of the 222 EST contigs that lacked an alignment over at least 50% of their length had an identifiable alignment to human refseq genes by BLASTP (19) (-e 1e-5), indicating that they are likely to represent bona fide protein-coding transcripts rather than artifactual sequence. Others may be contaminants of the EST library, or novel genes. For Mnemiopsis leidyi, a cDNA library was created from total RNA prepared from gastrula stage embryos and reversed transcribed with oligo-dT primers and the ZAP cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) by Kevin Pang and Mark Martindale. cDNA fragments with sizes ranging from ~500-2000 base pairs were cloned into pBluescript SK, and 15,360 paired clone end sequences were generated at JGI. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 5 Repeat sequences reconstructed from unassembled WGS reads Repeats were identified by assembling 16-mers (DNA sequences of length 16 bp) that frequently occurred in both ends of a sample of 50,000 fosmid clones from the ASYG library. Any 16-mers that occurred in both ends of at least 20 clones were used in the assemblies. The assemblies were performed using juggernaut.pl, a script developed for this purpose. tRNAScan-SE (20) was used to look for tRNAs and BLASTN (19) against nr and Repbase (21) to identify the 5S,18S,28S,U2,U6 RNAs, and two Nematostella transposons (see below). The five elements lacking notes are not identified by either of these methods.  The tandem array sizes are estimated by calculating the probability that a fosmid end matches the repeat given that its sister does. This probability can be used to estimate the expected array size (an average over multiple arrays in some cases) in terms of the mean fosmid length (37kb). These estimates depend on the assumptions of "normal" cloning behavior for these repetitive sequences. 10 families of tandemly repeated sequences were identified which occur in arrays longer than fosmid-length and account for 32% of the WGS data set. The key characteristics of these repeats are described in Table S2.2. See the file juggernaut.fasta for the complete sequences of these 10 elements, available from JGI Genome Portal (www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella).  Transposable elements in the sea anemone genome Transposable elements (TEs) constitute more than 26% of the assembled sea anemone genome (Table S2.3) and belong to >500 families. These families are composed of a small number of copies (from 1 to ~5,000) and they all are relatively young: elements from the oldest families are less than 15% divergent from their consensus sequences and their ORFs coding for transposases, reverse transcriptases, and other transposon-specific proteins are not severely damaged by mutations. In terms of their bulk contribution to the genome size, DNA transposons are fourfold more abundant than retrotransposons (Table S2.3). However, while different classes of anemone retrotransposons, including Gypsy, DIRS, Penelope, and CR1, are composed of more than 50-100 families each, just a few families represent different classes of autonomous DNA transposons. It appears that retrotransposition of retrotransposons, despite their high diversity, has not been as efficient as propagation of DNA transposons in the anemone genome. The variety of different types of DNA transposons found in the anemone genome is the highest among eukaryotic species studied so far. Representatives of all reported superfamilies and groups of eukaryotic DNA transposons (22-24), excluding the Transib superfamily and the Mariner group of the Mariner superfamily, are present in the anemone genome. Even, En/Spm (also called CACTA) and transposons, which were believed to populate plants genomes only (22), reside in the anemone genome. While the anemone 10,632-bp EnSpm-1_NV and 9,347-bp EnSpm-2_NV transposons encode transposases (TPase) similar to the plant En/Spm TPase and are flanked by 3-bp targets site duplications typical for known En/Spm elements, their 5’-CACAG termini differ from the 5’-CACTA termini of the plant transposons. Over 3% of the anemone genome is made of fossilized copies of self-synthesized Polinton DNA transposons whose transposition depends on the Polinton-encoded DNA polymerase and integrase (25). It makes Nematostella the first metazoan with Polintons constituting a substantial portion of the genome (25). Remarkably, the sea anemone genome is a safe haven for unusual transposons that have never been Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 6 seen before. For instance, Troyka, a novel type of LTR retrotransposons distantly related to the Gypsy superfamily, is characterized by 3-bp target site duplications (TSDs), while all known LTR retrotransposons, including retroviruses, are defined by 4-6 bp TSDs (22). Among DNA transposons, the hAT superfamily is well-known for TSDs that are always 8 bp long (22). However, the sea anemone genome, in addition to the canonical hAT transposons contains two novel groups, hAT5 and hAT6, characterized by 5-and 6-bp TSDs, respectively. Importantly, using reverse transcriptase/integrase and transposase encoded by the anemone Troyka, hAT5, and hAT6 transposons as queries in TBLASTN searches against GenBank DNA sequences, we found that proteins closest to the queries (>30% protein identity) are encoded by TEs characterized by the same unusual lengths of TSDs. For instance, Troyka retrotransposons are present also in sea urchin, and the hAT5 and hAT6 transposons are wide spread in sea urchin, sea squirts and lancelet. The anemone genome is also populated by a novel superfamily of eukaryotic “cut and paste” DNA transposons, called IS4EU, characterized by their TPase distantly related to the bacterial IS4 TPase. Following identification of the IS4EU TEs in the anemone genome, members of this superfamily have been also found in other species, including lancelet. Analyzing anemone TEs, we have also advanced in our understanding of evolution of non-LTR retrotransposons (Fig.S2.4). For instance, the anemone genome harbors two families of Tx1-like non-LTR retrotransposons, Tx1-1_NV and Tx1-2_NV, inserted in 5S rRNA and U2 smRNA, respectively, at target sites identical to those of different Tx1 elements in fish (26), frog and lancelet. We suggest that Tx1-like elements form a novel clade of non-LTR retrotransposons differing from the L1 clade elements by the strong target-site specificity. RTE is another clade of non-LTR retrotransposons first described a few years ago (22, 27). All known RTE elements, including those in plants, insects, nematodes, and vertebrates, contain only one ORF and are characterized by extremely frequent 5’ truncations of the RTE elements during their retrotransposition. Here, we show that the anemone genome contains several families of RTE-like elements, RTEX in Fig.S2.4, which are longer than canonical RTE elements and contain an additional ORF at their 5’ terminal portion that codes for the esterase domain, analogously to elements from the CR1/L2 clade (28). Transposable Element Analysis Methods Transposable elements were identified using WU-BLAST (http://blast.wustl.edu) and its implementation in CENSOR (http://girinst.org/censor/). First, we detected all fragments of the anemone genome coding for proteins similar to transposases, reverse transcriptases, and DNA polymerases representing all known classes of TEs. The detected DNA sequences have been clustered based on their pairwise identities by using BLASTclust (standalone NCBI BLAST (19)). Each cluster has been treated as a potential family of TEs described by its consensus sequence. The consensus sequences were built automatically based on multiple alignments of the cluster sequences expanded in both directions and manually modified based on structural characteristics of known TEs. Using WU-BLAST/CENSOR we identified fragments of the anemone genome similar to the consensus sequences that were considered as copies of TEs. Second, given the identified consensus sequences, we detected automatically insertions longer than 50-bp present in the identified copies of the protein-coding TEs. The insertions have been treated as potential TEs, clustered based on their pairwise DNA identities and replaced by their consensus sequences built for each cluster. After manual refinements of the consensus sequences, the identified families of TEs were classified based on their structural hallmarks, including target site duplications, terminal repeats, encoded proteins and similarities to TEs classified previously. Identified TEs are deposited in Repbase (21).    Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 7 Chromosome Number The synchronous cell divisions during early development of Nematostella allowed easy access to large numbers of metaphase plates. Due to loss or overlapping of individual chromosomes, counts tend to underestimate the actual numbers. The analysis shows, however, that the great majority of counts showed 2n = 30 chromosomes (Fig.S2.5). Interestingly, as in Hydra, the chromosomes do not differ significantly in size, which makes it difficult to create a reliable karyotype. No evidence of morphologically distinct sex chromosomes was found. Based on the estimated genome size of 457 Mb, the average size of a chromosome is in the range of 30.5 Mb. The number of chromosomes found in Nematostella is roughly in the range of what has been reported from other cnidarians: a diploid chromosome set of 30 has been determined in several representatives of the genera Hydra and Pelmatohydra (29-31), which (with the exception of Hydra viridis) have a 3-4 fold larger genome size. The chromosome counts from 24 hydrozoan and one scyphozoan species apparently can be anything from 2n = 12 to 32 (reviewed in (32)). Among anthozoans the karyotypes of Aptasiomorpha sp. (2n = 32), several Acropora species (2n = 28) and two species of Anthopleura (2n = 18) have been reported (33-35). Supplement S3: Gene prediction Gene prediction and quality control The genome of Nematostella vectensis includes 27,273 predicted gene models built using the JGI Annotation Pipeline, described below. The genomic sequence, predicted genes and annotations of Nematostella, together with available evidence, are available at the JGI Genome Portal (www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella). The JGI Annotation Pipeline was used for annotation of the v1.0 Nematostella assembly described here. The pipeline includes the following annotation steps: (1) repeat masking, (2) mapping ESTs, full length cDNAs, and putative full length genes, (3) gene prediction using several methods, (4) protein annotation using several methods, and (5) combining gene predictions into a non redundant representative set of gene models, which are subject to genome-scale analysis. Transposons were masked in the Nematostella assembly using RepeatMasker (36) tools and a custom library of manually curated repeats (deposited in RepBase (21)). 146,095 ESTs were clustered into 30,813 consensus sequences and both individual ESTs and consensus sequences were mapped onto genome assembly using BLAT (18). Annotation of Nematostella v1.0 was based on several gene predictors ab initio FGENESH (37), homology-based FGENESH+ (37), homology-based GENEWISE (38), and available ESTs. A set of 1,678 genes derived from EST clusters with a putative full length ORF was directly mapped to the genomic sequence to build gene models. FGENESH was trained on this set to achieve sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 80%, respectively. To generate homology-based gene models, proteins from the NCBI NR database were aligned against genomic sequence using BlastX (19). High quality seed proteins were then used to build models using FEGENESH+ and GENEWISE. GENEWISE gene models were then filtered to remove models with frame shifts and internal stop-codons and extended to include start and stop codons where possible. FGENESH, FGENESH+ and GENEWISE gene models were then processed using ESTEXT to correct them according to splicing patterns observed in available ESTs and to extend 3’ and 5’ UTR of the genes. All gene models were annotated by homology to other proteins from NCBI NR, SwissProt and KEGG Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 8 databases. Using InterproScan (39) we predicted proteins domains. Using both these sources of information, annotation of each protein was mapped to the terms of Gene Ontology (40), KOG clusters of orthologs (41), and mapped to KEGG pathways (42). The large set of all predicted models was reduced to a non-redundant set of 27,273 representative models (Filtered Models), where a single best gene model according to the criteria of homology and EST support describes every locus. For this set of representative gene models we assigned GO (40) terms to 12,786 proteins, 16,625 (78%) proteins to KOG clusters (41), and 695 distinct EC numbers were assigned to 2,822 proteins mapped to KEGG pathways (42). Table S3.1 summarizes the set of predicted genes. The data are available from JGI Genome Portal (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella) and has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the project accession ABAV00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, ABAV01000000. Gene Content Human Genes Sharing Ancestry with Nematostella Genes To determine the number of genes in the Nematostella genome, we estimated how many of the 27,273 predicted gene models represent unique genes in the genome, as opposed to spurious gene predictions, fragmentary gene models, pseudogenes or unrecognized transposable element sequence. First, the Nematostella gene models were divided into categories based on the quality of their hits to the human proteome. Specifically we define the "best C-value", for each Nematostella gene, to be the ratio of the BLAST score of its best hit to the human genome to the highest BLAST score of the best-hitting human gene to any Nematostella gene. The number of genes with best C-value greater than or equal to Cmin, for Cmin from 0 to 1, is plotted in Figure S3.1 for two choices of BLAST e-value threshold. This value is by construction equal to 1 for genes with a mutual best, and the human and Nematostella curves converge at Cmin=1 for each choice of e-value. At the opposite extreme of Cmin=0, the curves reach the total number of genes with detectable alignment in the other genome. If a species has undergone extensive 'paralog-formation', for example by a genome duplication relative to the other, we will expect the curve for genes of the 'duplicated' species hitting genes of the 'unduplicated' species being above the vice versa, for ranges 0.8 <= Cmin <1, i.e. the 'co-orthologs' range, as we observe for human in the plot. If the curve for a species does not flatten as Cmin-> 0 this means that there are many genes in that species having low best C-values, which is what we expect for pseudogenes and/or transposons where partial gene predictions have been made. For Nematostella, this curve shows a large excess, exceeding the human curve for values of Cmin > 0.5, while falling below human at high Cmin values. To asses whether the excess of gene models with low best C-value in Nematostella reflect the contribution of a large number of small, fragmentary models and pseudogenes, 60 Nematostella genes were subjected to a detailed manual review. Twenty genes were selected at random from the JGI Nematostella Filtered Models version 1.0 ("FM1.0 set") in each of the following categories: 1) BCV (best C-value to human) = 0, meaning no BLAST hit to human. 5486 of the FM1.0 set have BCV = 0. 2) 0 < BCV < 0.4. 4889 of the FM1.0 set. 3) BCV >= 0.4. 18274 of the FM1.0 set. Manual review is by definition somewhat subjective, but using conservative criteria, i.e. avoiding dismissing too many genes, the results of the sampling indicate that about one third of all genes in the FM1.0 set could be expected to be rejected by manual reviews. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 9 Category 1), 8 of the 20 were deemed "real genes", i.e. from the total number of genes with BCV = 0 we would expect ~ 0.4 * 5489 = 2194 genes to "pass manual scrutiny". Note that 15 of the 20 in this category have 1 or 2 exons. Category 2). 10 of 20 were deemed real. 11 of the 20 have 1 or 2 exons. Predicted # genes to pass manual review: 4889 * 0.5 = 2445 Category 3). These are high BCV genes, 13 of which have BCV > 0.8. Here, 15 of the 20 are thought to be real genes. In some cases, it looked like two gene models should be merged, and we tried roughly to call a gene here every other time, to approximately get the right gene count. From the counts here, we would expect ~ 0.75 * 18274 = 13706 genes in this category. Adding up these expected numbers gives us an estimate of 18,345 bona fide Nematostella genes. Even this may be an overestimate, since quite a few of the genes with lower c-values are at the edges of short scaffolds, and their other half may be picked up by another scaffold, causing 2 annotations for a single gene. Additional observations on the Nematostella proteome • The human genome has more genes with a mutual best hit in Nematostella than in the proteomes of Ciona, fruit flies or nematodes. (Figure S3.2) • The Nematostella genome contains many proteins with domain architectures (combinations of PFAM domains) that are shared exclusively with vertebrate genes. (Figure S3.3) • Of the PFAM domains present in human, mouse, dog, chicken, frog and fugu, Nematostella has more in common than any of Ciona, fruit fly, or nematode. (Figure S3.4) • There are 5 large clusters of short proteins (around ~100aa), each comprising 55-74 members with weak similarity to hypothetical short ORFs from fungi (43) • There are 242 clusters of tandemly duplicated genes, comprising 2-13 members, with annotated Pfam domains, which apparently were duplicated after split of Bilateria • There are 9 neurotoxins genes, with an anemone neurotoxin domain (PF0076) previously found only in the Cnidaria, but not previously in Nematostella, and 5 copies of green fluorescent protein (PF01353), originally found in jellyfish and predominantly found in Cnidaria (44). • 16 Pfam domains previously exclusively found only in vertebrates, but not in other bilaterian phyla (or other eukaryotes), are present in Nematostella genome, including:     PF01500- Keratin, high sulfur B2 protein                          PF00040-Fibronectin type II domain     PF06954- Resistin     PF06990- Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase     PF05038- Cytochrome b558 alpha-subunit Lineage Specific Expansions We identified 809 “recent” tandem expansions in the Nematostella genome, comprising 1,854 protein-coding genes. A similar algorithm applied to the ENSEMBL annotation of the human genome detected 504 recent expansions with 1,317 genes. The algorithm is as follows: first, all genes on chromosomes or scaffolds with three or more annotated genes were numbered in occurring order. From an all-against-all Smith-Waterman alignment of these peptides, all hits with greater than 60% identity and with at least 25 conserved four-fold degenerate codons were retained. This filtering step helps eliminate pseudogenes and spurious hits of low-complexity regions, and allows a divergence epoch estimate for the pair based on four-fold degenerate transversion frequency (4DTv) (14). Since our focus is on expansions specific to the Nematostella lineage, we only consider hits with 4DTv < 0.2, i.e. 20% or less Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 10 observed transversions at four-fold degenerate 3rd codon positions. Extrapolating from vertebrate calibrations, this corresponds to gene duplications no older than 150-200 million years. Next, the scaffolds were scanned for pairwise hits under the above criteria with no more than three unrelated genes separating them. This allows for intervening spurious gene models as well as small-scale inversions. Finally, all such pairs with one of the genes being within three genes of a member of another pair were clustered in a single-linkage fashion. To assess the probability of detecting tandem expansions by chance, we repeated this approach on versions of the human and Nematostella gene sets in which the gene order had been randomly scrambled. We found a single spurious 2-member cluster in Nematostella and four in human. Hence, we expect the false positive rate of this approach to be less than 1%. In order to assess to what extent these relatively recent expansions have been retained by positive selection, and to compare the types of expansions found in Nematostella to those in vertebrates, we performed the following analysis: first, we scanned all of the genes in the human and Nematostella gene sets for PFAM-A domains using hmmpfam (45). We were able to assign one or more PFAM domains to 15,102 human genes and 12,202 Nematostella genes. We then formulated a neutral-evolution hypothesis that any gene has an equal probability of getting duplicated and fixed in the population. For genes with a certain domain we can then test the validity of this hypothesis by comparing the frequencies of such genes in the recent expansions to the overall frequency. For example, the number of recently created genes in Nematostella containing a PF000001 seven trans-membrane family (rhodopsin family) domain is 33 (subtracting one “seed” member of each tandem cluster). Since 779 of the 12,202 Nematostella genes contain this domain, the expected number in the recently expanded set (with a total of 572 genes with PFAM domains) under the neutral hypothesis is 36.5 +-5.8, where the binomial approximation has been used since the recent genes constitutes a small fraction of the total genes in both species. Hence, in Nematostella, there is no evidence for recent selection for retention of new genes created by tandem duplication with PF000001. In the human genome, on the other hand, 112 such genes are observed, with an expected value of 29 +-5.3, consistent with a strong recent selective retention of such receptors (olfactory and visual) within vertebrates or mammals. Tables S3.3 (Nematostella) and S3.4 (human) show all PFAM domains found in at least four genes in recent tandem expansions, and with a frequency of at least 3 sigma above the expected frequency under the neutral hypothesis. In general, the gene families showing strong expansions along the two lineages are different. In addition to olfactory and taste receptors, the human genome shows strong recent preference of C2H2 zinc finger genes with a KRAB domain, keratin, and immune defense proteins. This newly acquired repertoire almost certainly plays a key role in defining vertebrates and mammals. Similarly, the genes listed in Table S3.3 can be hypothesized to play a significant role in distinguishing Nematostella. Note that this analysis is biased towards vertebrates, for which more domains have been characterized. Supplement S4: Construction and characterization of eumetazoan gene families A simple way to identify putative orthologs (genes descended from the same gene in the common ancestor) between genomes is through reciprocal best-scoring BLAST hits. The human genome has more such orthologous pairs with Nematostella (6,989) than with non-vertebrate bilaterians, including Drosophila (5,772), C. elegans (4,846), and even the invertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis (6,313). To understand gene creation and duplication we designed a phylogenetically informed clustering algorithm that produces clusters at the base (most distant in time) and tip (most recent point) of a given internal branch (stem) of the species tree. Each cluster is composed of a group of modern genes that are the offspring of one gene in the common ancestor. Our algorithm takes as input: a) The genomes that have arisen as descendants from our stem of interest. These are our in-group genomes. b) Other genomes that serve as phylogenetic out-groups. c) Pairwise alignment scores for all pairs of genes in the in-and out-groups. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 11 d) Any previous clusterings made of the in-group genomes we want to preserve. From this data our algorithm operates as follows: i) A graph is made where each node is an in-group gene. Edges are added if two genes are mutual best hits between species. Edges are also added if two genes are in any clusters in input (d). ii) A single linkage clustering is done of the graph. This represents the clusters at the tip of our stem. The mutual best hits captures the likely orthologs between the organisms while the clusters passed in as input (d) captures the paralogs from the stems emanating from the tip of the current stem of interest. iii) For each cluster made in (ii), the top m hits to the out-groups are found where m = twice the number of out-groups. This collection of out-group genes is called the potential blockers for this cluster. iv) Two clusters from (ii) are merged if they share at least one potential blocker and for every potential blocker the genes with which it aligns are closer [by BLAST score] to each other than either is to its potential blocker. This gives us a set of clusters that existed at the base of our stem of interest. Blastp was run using BLOSUM45, e-value cutoff 0.001, and filtering was turned off. Only the top 1500 hits were considered if more hits passed these criteria. The genomes used are as follows: Xenopus tropicalis JGI v4.1 Takifugu rubripes JGI v4.0 Nematostella vectensis JGI V1.0 (this work) Homo sapiens Ensembl build 38 Drosophila melanogaster Ensembl build 38 Caenorhabditis elegans Ensembl build 38 Arabidopsis thaliana From NCBI on 11/2005 Saccharomyces cerevisiae From genome-ftp.stanford.edu, version released on July 7, 2004 Dictyostelium discoideum From dictybase.org, Annotations released on 7/11/2005 Supplement S5: Phylogenetic analysis of Metazoa We compared predicted protein sequences from Nematostella to those from other metazoan and out-group genomes, and find that Nematostella genes are more similar to vertebrate genes than to fly and nematode genes using Bayesian branch length estimation and an analysis of percent sequence identity. ((46) came to the same conclusion using ESTs and BLAST e-value to measure similarity.) Of the 7,766 ancestral metazoan gene clusters, 1,619 are composed of a single gene from each of the six representative metazoan genomes listed in Supplement S4: human, fish, frog, Nematostella, fruit fly and nematode. Starting with this set of apparently single-copy genes in these six genomes, we searched six additional complete or partial genome sequence data sets (of a tunicate, a gastropod mollusk, a hydrozoan cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, a sponge, and yeast), and a collection of ESTs from the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (see Table S5.1 for a list of data sources) for orthologous genes, making a total of twelve whole genome data sets, plus the EST-derived sequences from Mnemiopsis. For each additional genome, if a mutual-best hit existed to the human gene in the cluster, that gene was identified as an ortholog, and added to the cluster. We compared the results obtained with this set with those obtained using Nematostella rather than human as the anchor for identifying orthologs, and found that it did not change the results. By this method, 337 ortholog sets were identified that had one gene representing each of the twelve whole genome datasets. Only nine ortholog sets contained one gene from each of the twelve whole genomes plus a Mnemiopsis sequence. We constructed two concatenated multiple sequence alignments from the identified orthologs: one with and one without the ctenophore sequence. In each case, multiple sequence alignments for each orthologous set were computed with MUSCLE (47), and well-aligned regions extracted with GBLOCKS (48) using conservative settings (all available sequences in an orthologous group were required to be well aligned at the start and the end of each extracted block:-b1=N-b2=N, where N is equal to the Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 12 number of sequences in the alignment.) We constructed two concatenated multiple alignments for investigating metazoan phylogeny and relative rates of protein sequence evolution among the different lineages. The first (Alignment 1) excludes sequence from the Mnemiopsis ESTs, and includes only the 337-ortholog sets with representation from each of the other twelve genomes. The second (Alignment 2) was compiled from the multiple alignments including the Mnemiopsis data and includes all ortholog sets with twelve or thirteen members, plus all ortholog sets including a Mnemiopsis sequence. Alignment 1 consists of 19,563 columns, with no missing data. This data matrix was analyzed using mrbayes version 3.1.2 (49, 50), using a the WAG (51) model of protein evolution, a Gamma distribution of rate variation among sites, approximated by four rate categories, and a category for invariant sites. Multiple runs from different starting topologies all converged on the same topology, branch lengths and posterior probabilities for protein evolution model parameters within approximately 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations. The mean and variance of the posterior probabilities for total tree length, Gamma distribution shape parameter alpha and the fraction of invariable sites were 2.278 +-0.001, 0.818 +-0.001, and 0.2291 +-0.0001, respectively. Figure S5.1 shows the consensus tree topology and branch lengths. All nodes were resolved as shown in 100% of the samples trees. The sequences of the genes used in Alignment 1 are available in FASTA format in S5.fasta. Alignment 2 consists of 19,977 columns, however only 2272 columns contain Mnemiopsis sequence. To test whether this data could be used to shed light additional light on the phylogenetic relationships among cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians, we submitted this dataset to a maximum likelihood analysis using the PHYLIP package's PROML program (52), and compared the likelihood scores of three topologies: ctenophores sister to cnidarians+bilaterians, ctenophores sister to bilaterians, and ctenophores sister to cnidarians. Of these, the first had the highest likelihood score, but it was not significantly better than the second in a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. The branch lengths for the tree shown in Figure 1 were estimated using PROML, for the defined topology illustrated, with a trifurcation at the cnidarian/ctenophore/bilaterian divergence. To make an extremely rough estimate of divergence time between bilaterians and cnidarians, we interpolated following Dawkins (53) between recent molecular clock estimates (54) of the timing of the protostome-deuterostome (95% confidence interval: 640-760 Mya) and choanoflagellate-metazoan (95% CI: 760-960 Mya) divergences. Figure 1 in the main text shows that the cnidarian-bilaterian split lies ~30% of the way between these two nodes (adopting the midpoint rooting as shown), suggesting that the eumetazoan ancestor lived between 670 and 820 Mya. The relatively slow rate of protein sequence evolution in Nematostella compared to fly and nematode can be seen more directly by considering the amino-acid percent identity between reciprocal-best-hits of selected proteomes vs. human. Despite the fact that flies and nematodes share a more recent common ancestor with human than sea anemones do, we find that the anemone peptides are more similar to human than to either of the model protostomes (46, 55). Figure S5.1 shows, in a more direct way, the greater similarity between human and Nematostella proteins than between human and fly/nematode proteins. Supplement S6: Intron Splice Site Conservation Intron conservation can be unambiguously assessed by identifying well-aligned regions of orthologous proteins that are interrupted by introns in one or more species (Figure 3a). Note that this analysis is protected from the effects of gene modeling artifacts, since erroneous predictions in the vicinity of splice sites would disrupt alignment, thereby removing such sequences from consideration. To study intron loss and gain in orthologous genes in multiple species, we first aligned the Nematostella gene set to the set of human ENSEMBL models (release 26.35.1) and to the TIGR release 5 of Arabidopsis thaliana genes. In 2,347 cases, a human gene was found to have a mutual best hit to both a Nematostella and an Arabidopsis gene, forming a tentative cluster of orthologous genes to be studied further. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 13 Gene models are often incomplete in the 5’ ends and may have poorly determined splice sites, so we restrict our analysis to regions of highly conserved peptides in the orthologs of all three species. The independent identification of such regions in multiple species provides strong evidence for the accuracy of the gene models in these regions. Hence, we performed multiple alignments of the orthologous clusters and identified gap-free blocks flanked by fully conserved amino acids. We then identified annotated splice sites of all species within these regions, which the additional requirements that 1) none of the peptides must have a gap in the alignment closer than 3 AA from the splice site and 2) no two different peptides must have splice sites at different positions closer than 4 AA. Empirically, these requirements are necessary to avoid spurious detection of “intron losses” due to ambiguities in either the multiple alignment or the gene model’s splice sites. While some of these cases may reflect real sliding of donor or acceptor sites, we restrict ourselves to studying gains and losses of introns here. Finally, we required that at least 5 amino acids out of 10 in the flanking regions of the splice sites be either fully conserved or have strong functional similarity among all four species. 9,947 highly reliable intron splice sites were identified by these requirements. The results are summarized as a Venn diagram in figure S6.1, indicating the number of shared introns between the species. Remarkably, about 81% of the human introns (4,403 of 5,435) are shared with Nematostella. Assuming that intron losses have occurred independently in the human and Nematostella lineages, and that the probability of independent intron insertion events at the same location is negligible we estimate the loss in Nematostella since the last common ancestor (LCA) with human as 158/ (158 + 1258) = 11%. In a similar fashion, we estimate a loss of almost 22% along the human lineage, twice the amount of introns lost in the Nematostella lineage. The above results also allow us to place upper limits on intron gains within the human and Nematostella lineages: 28.6% of all introns shared by human and Nematostella (and hence present in their LCA) are also shared by Arabidopsis. If additional introns have been independently gained in each lineage we expect a lower fraction of the total introns in each species to be shared with Arabidopsis. In fact, we find 26.5% of all Nematostella introns and 26.1% of all human introns are shared with Arabidopsis, which translate into maximum intron gains of ~9% in human and ~7% in Nematostella. These results are strict upper limits, since the lower conservation with Arabidopsis can also be explained if the loss rate varies inherently between introns. In this case we will expect introns that are shared between human and Nematostella to be less prone to loss, and hence a larger fraction will also have survived in Arabidopsis. This scenario is very conceivable since some introns have been shown to contain regulatory elements and the loss of such introns would presumably be selected against.   To the extent that the introns in highly conserved peptide regions studied here are representative of introns in general, the above analysis suggests that the Nematostella genome has only lost 11% of its introns since the LCA with human, and gained at most 7%. We next identified 2,347 clusters of orthologous genes in all bilaterian orthologous clusters with an unambiguous 1:1:1 member relationship in human, Drosophila melanogaster (fly), and C. elegans. In 1,523 of these clusters, the human gene had a mutual best hit to a Nematostella gene, forming clusters of four orthologous genes. 4,951 highly reliable introns were identified by these requirements. The results are summarized in Table S6.1. Nematostella has the most introns at these conserved positions, followed by human with a relative intron frequency of about 0.91, whereas nematode and in particular fly have considerably fewer introns (0.37 and 0.21). From these numbers we estimate the intron losses in fly, nematode, and human since their LCA to be 82% , 77%, and 12% respectively. Note that the nematode, although having retained only ~23% of the introns since the LCA with human have ~37% of the number of human introns. This suggests a considerable gain of introns in the nematodes, as also reported by [Logsdon 2004]. This analysis of aligning conserved sequences to identify conservation of introns was further extended to include seven species-Nematostella vectensis, Homo sapiens, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Arabidopsis thaliana. 4342 Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 14 introns from the seven genomes at 2645 aligned positions that contain an intron in at least one of the seven orthologs. Methods for Intron Gain/Loss tree Starting from the binary character matrix compiled as described above of 2,645 intron positions across 7 taxa, we found the most parsimonious solution to the intron gain/loss problem by projecting these characters onto the (known) topology. Weighted parsimony as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10 (56) was used, with the cost of an intron gain significantly greater (more than 10X) the cost of an intron loss. The parsimony assignment of characters to internal nodes is independent of this gain/loss weight ratio. From the branch lengths produced by PAUP, and the known weights, we solved for the number of losses and gains along each branch as show in the main text figure. Supplement S7: Analysis of anciently conserved gene linkage We first searched for regions of approximately conserved gene order between Nematostella and human, allowing for local rearrangements as well as independent differential gene loss and/or duplication in each genome (57). We found 33 conserved syntenic segments, each containing 9 or more orthologous gene pairs, under conditions for which no such segments are expected when gene order is completely randomized in the two genomes (Figure S7.1). Within each segment, however, local gene order is considerably scrambled.  Further relaxing gene order constraints dramatically increases the number of such segments expected by chance, reducing the power of this approach to detect even more ancient conserved genome organization in the face of intra-chromosomal rearrangements. To overcome this limitation we developed a new method to search for statistically significant conserved linkage groups that does not rely on gene order. Local conservation of gene order To search the human and Nematostella genomes for regions of conserved linkage, we performed the following analysis. First, the genes on each genome were assigned unique identifiers according to the order in which they occur on the chromosomes or scaffolds. We then used the sequence alignments described in the clustering section to scan each genome for tandem expanded gene families, defined here as clusters of genes with a maximum of 4 intervening genes, showing similarity at e-values < 1x10-10. All but one member, the longest peptide, were excluded from further analysis at each such region in the genomes. From the human vs. Nematostella protein alignments we next excluded all genes with more than 15 hits with e-value < 1x10-10 from consideration. Finally, of the remaining pair-wise hits we included only hits with a score of more than 70% of the value of the highest score of either of the two genes to any of the genes in the opposite genome. This approach enriches the set for orthologous gene pairs while removing weak super-family similarities from the analysis. At this stage we were left with 11,351 pair-wise hits, involving 6,986 Nematostella genes and 8,426 human genes. We then recalculated the gene order IDs in the two genomes, featuring only the genes involved in these high-quality alignments, and scanned for regions of conserved synteny or linkage in the following manner: For the first pair-wise alignment of genes in the proteomes of the two species, the gene locations on the chromosomes were recorded and a one-pair segment of conserved synteny was defined. Subsequent gene pairs either defines new segments, or, if the genes in both species are located within a specified maximum distance, Nmax from a gene pair in an existing segment, the pair is added to that segment. If a pair can be added to two segments, these segments are joined into a larger segment of conserved synteny. Note that this method does not require strict conservation of gene order: inversions on scales Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 15 smaller than Nmax are tolerated. After traversing all alignments, we have a set of conserved regions, on which we can impose a minimum member limit (typical 3 pairs) to remove potentially spurious regions. For human-Nematostella, we found no strict significant conservation of gene order, but by choosing a large value of Nmax we nonetheless detect regions of conserved linkage in which the local gene order has been scrambled. In order to detect the significance of these regions, we randomly scrambled the order of the genes on each chromosome or scaffold and applied, for the same sequence alignment data, the algorithm to the scrambled data set. This allows us to choose parameters to minimize false positive detection. Note the importance of the filtering out weak hits in this method, as the presence of such hits would significantly increase the false positive rate in the detection of segments of conserved linkage. Using Nmax = 40 and considering only segments of 9 or more participating genes, we find 33 such segments of conserved synteny between human and Nematostella, with none expected by chance, as seen by running the algorithm on the scrambled set. Identification of human genome segments free of recent chromosomal fusions and large-scale rearrangements To facilitate the search for large-scale conservation of gene linkage in the presence of extensive changes in local gene order between humans and Nematostella, we identified 98 segments of the human genome which appear to be uninterrupted by inter-chromosomal translocations or fusions when compared to the genomes of other chordates. To identify likely locations of chromosomal fusions along the human genome that separate such segments, we followed the following procedure: 1. Putatively orthologous gene pairs were identified between the ENSEMBL human gene set and the chordate Branchiostoma floridae draft gene set [JGI web page] using the mutual best BLAST hit criterion. 2. Scaffolds of the B. floridae assembly were clustered as described below for Nematostella, based on the similarity of the distribution in the human genome of human genes orthologous the genes on the scaffold. 3. A representation of each human chromosome arm was constructed in which each gene along the chromosome was represented by the identifying number of the cluster of scaffolds in which its B. floridae ortholog resides. 4. A Hidden Markov Model, constructed and implemented in software for the purpose, was used to segment the human chromosomes into segments with an approximately uniform distribution of hits to a specific subset of the scaffold clusters. Figure S7.2 illustrates the results of this procedure for human chromosome arms 14q, 15q, 16p and 16q, and Table S7.1 lists the extent of the 98 identified segments in base pair coordinates on the NCBI Human genome build 36. Construction and Significance Testing of Putative Ancestral Linkage groups (PALs) To test for conservation of large-scale synteny in the presence of extensive local rearrangement of gene order, we compared 147 of the largest scaffolds of the Nematostella assembly to the segments of the 98 human genome described above. The examined scaffolds were selected because, like the 98 human segments, each contains descendants of 40 or more ancestral eumetazoan genes. For each scaffold-segment pair, we tabulated the number of ancestral gene clusters giving rise to descendants on both members of the pair. This number counts the number of independent orthologs shared by the scaffold and the segment. For each scaffold-segment pair, the number of observed orthologs was compared to a null model in which scaffolds and segments comprise genes descending from genes drawn Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 16 independently from the set of 7,766 ancestral genes. This method of counting orthologs, and this null model control naturally for independent tandem gene duplicates which could otherwise artifactually inflate the number of observed orthologs in circumstances where there is no remnant of conserved synteny, because tandem duplicates arising independently should be contained in a single reconstructed ancestral gene cluster.  The expected number of orthologs under this model is governed by the hypergeometric distribution, allowing us to compute a p-value for consistency for each scaffold-segment comparison with the null model. Since we compared 147 scaffolds with 98 segments, we applied a Bonferroni correction factor of 1/14406. The complete set of these numbers of shared orthologous genes are shown in figure S7.3, for all scaffolds (67/147) and segments (40/98) which participated in a statistically significant shared synteny relationship. Table cell backgrounds are colored yellow when p < 0.01/14406, and pink when p < 0.05/ 14406. A blue background indicates p<0.5/14406. Table S7.3 has 112 yellow cells, corresponding to 112 cases of statistically significant conservation of synteny between a Nematostella scaffold and a segment of the human genome. The rows and columns of this table have been ordered to reveal 13 sets of scaffolds and chromosome segments, defined by the criterion that none can be subdivided without separating into different sets a scaffold-segment pair with significant evidence (p<0.01) for conserved synteny.  We interpret these collections of modern sequences to be descended from the same chromosomes, or chromosomal segments of the common ancestor of eumetazoa, and refer to them therefore as putative ancestral linkage groups, or PALs. Table S7.3 lists the 255 ancestral gene clusters linked with the HOX clusters in PAL-A. A clustering method allows more extensive reconstruction of putative ancestral linkage groups. Having demonstrated that there is extensive conservation of linkage relationships among genes using the conservative statistical criteria described above, we developed a more sensitive method to reconstruct ancestral linkage groups based on clustering scaffolds or chromosome segments. In this method, a matrix of ortholog counts similar to that shown in figure S7.3 is constructed. The rows and columns of this table are then clustered hierarchically, using Pearson correlation as a measure of similarity and the average pairwise linkage method with the "cluster" program (58). Figure S7.4 shows the result as a "dot plot" as in figure S7.2. Horizontal and vertical lines divide clusters of scaffolds (vertical lines) and human chromosome segments (horizontal lines), defined by a cut of the hierarchical tree at a correlation coefficient of 0.2. This clustering of scaffolds and chromosome segments defines 15 large PALs, each with descendants of more than one hundred ancestral eumetazoan genes. 3055 ancestral genes, or 40% of the ancestral genes are assigned to one of these PALs. Supplement S8: Eumetazoan Ancestry of Genes Construction of "Centroid" sequences. We define the "centroid" of a cluster of orthologous amino acid sequences to be a synthetic amino acid sequence that maximizes the sum of BLAST alignment scores between the centroid and the members of the cluster. This provides a surrogate for the peptide sequence that is ancestral to each cluster. Classification of eumetazoan genes by ancestry Centroids (see above) of the ancestral eumetazoan gene clusters were aligned to non-animal entries in Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 17 SwissProt/TREMBL[Uniprot release 8 from http://www.uniprot.org] with BLAST (19), using the NCBI taxonomy database to remove metazoan entries. The Pfam (45) annotation of SwissProt/TREMBL from swisspfam [Version of Sept. 6 2006. Current version available from http://pfam.janelia.org] was parsed to identify Pfam domains found only in animals, as well as pairs of Pfam domains that occur separately in non-animals but only were found together in animals. Clusters whose centroid had a BLAST hit to out-group proteins of e-value <1e-6, and also clusters containing a member which is a mutual best hit to an Arabidopsis, Dictyostelium or Saccharomyces were annotated as "ancient," unless one of the following conditions was met: 1) if both the Nematostella peptide and at least one other animal protein had an "animal specific" Pfam domain, the cluster was designated a type II novelty. 2) if both the Nematostella peptide and at least one other animal protein had an "animal specific" Pfam domain combination, the cluster was designated a type III novelty. Note that type III (animal-specific eukaryotic domain combinations) are based only on pairwise combinations. Thus animal proteins that shuffle the order of domains found within an ancient eukaryotic family are not designated as novel in this analysis. Functional annotation of ancestral gene clusters Panther (59, 60) family annotations on the sequences of extant species were transferred to the inferred ancestral clusters when both Nematostella and bilaterian members of the clusters shared the same Panther annotation. These annotations were mapped to various overlapping functional categories using the Panther Pathways (60) and Panther Ontology databases. To asses whether specific functional categories were over-or underrepresented among the different types of novelties, we adapted the GOstat approach of Beissbarth and Speed (61) for use with the Panther ontologies, and computed p-values for enrichment and dearth relative the hypergeometric distribution. For both Panther Pathways and Panther Ontology, we limited our tests to the 100 ontology terms which had the greatest number of inferred ancestral genes assigned to them, and applied a Bonferroni correction for 100 tests, even though this is somewhat conservative, since the categories have significant overlap.

Figure S2.1: Observed density of polymorphic 4-fold degenerate codon positions. The rate of single nucleotide polymorphism observed in four-fold degenerate codon positions of gene Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 18 models is 0.85%. Figure S2.1 shows the observed (read) and Poisson ascertainment bias-corrected (green) frequency of polymorphic 4-fold degenerate sites as a function of local depth of assembly for a sampling of 17.3 million 4-fold degenerate codons [Left hand scale]. Positions are considered polymorphic if two or more WGS reads indicate each of two or more different bases at a given position. The blue histogram shows the number of positions considered for each depth of coverage [right hand scale]. Figure S2.2: Observed density of polymorphic sites The rate of single nucleotide polymorphism observed in the assembled genome sequence is 0.8%. Figure S2.2 shows the observed (red) and Poisson ascertainment bias-corrected (green) frequency of polymorphic positions as a function of local depth of assembly for a sampling of 14.4 million positions in the assembly [Left hand scale]. Positions are considered polymorphic if two or more WGS reads indicate each of two or more different bases at a given position. The blue curve shows the number of positions considered for each depth of coverage, and the gray curve shows Poisson distributed counts with the same mean. Figure S2.3: Four-haplotype polymorphism fit The number of polymorphic sites (red crosses) as a function of local depth of the assembly is compared with expected values for four independent haplotypes with average pairwise differences of 0.5% (green), 0.64% (blue) and 0.7% (purple). Figure. S2.4 Neighbor-joining tree of eukaryotic non-LTR retrotransposons constructed for their reverse transcriptase. Black circles mark novel families of non-LTR retrotransposons identified in this study. Unmarked retrotransposons have been described previously and are collected in Repbase Reports. Abbreviations of host species are as follows: NV, Nematostella vectensis; XT, frog Xenopus tropicalis; BF, lancelet Branchiostoma floridae; AG, mosquito Anopheles gambiae; DM, fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; DR, fish Danio rerio; CR, green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; TP, diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana; SP, sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; PS, turtle Platemys spixii; SJ, blood fluke Schistosoma japonica; Cis, sea squirt Ciona savignyi. Only >40% bootstrap values are shown next to corresponding nodes of the tree (based on MEGA3 (62)). Clades and groups of non-LTR retrotransposons are indicated by black and blue rectangles. Figure S2.5 Number of chromosomes The number of chromosomes was determined by analyzing over 90 metaphase plates in spreads. The conclusion is that 2N = 30, the same number as in Hydra. A sample metaphase plate is shown, with the histogram of the number of observed chromosomes per plate. Figure S3.1: Distribution of C-score The number of genes with a best C-value (see section S3) greater than Cmin, or Cmin from zero to one, with alignment e-value threshold Nematostella (red) and human (blue), with BLAST e-value threshold 1e-10 (solid curves) and 1e-3 (dashed). Figure S3.2: Number of bidirectional BlastP hits (potential ‘orthologs’) between 22,218 human genes (from Ensembl) and other organisms with known genomes. Despite early divergence, sea anemone shares more hits with human, than other bilaterians, except vertebrates. Figure S3.3: Fraction of unique multi (Pfam) domain (2 or more domains) gene models from Nematostella (total 983) shared by other metazoans and yeast. Figure S3.4: 2264 Pfam domains present in all 6 vertebrates with known genomes: human, mouse, dog, chicken, frog and fugu. Below is the histogram of numbers of these domains shared by Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 19 Ciona, fly, nematode and sea anemone. Figure S5.1: Distribution of percent ID Against Human Proteins The distribution of the percent identity in mutual-best-hit protein alignments between human genes and the genes of the frog, Xenopus tropicalis, pufferfish Takifugu rubripes, Nematostella, fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Figure S6.1: Venn diagram for three-way intron conservation comparison Venn diagram showing the distribution of 9,947 intron splice sites in Homo sapiens, Nematostella vectensis, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Figure S7.1: Synteny block search The size distribution of synteny blocks for human vs. Nematostella (blue bars) is compared to that for a synthetic data set in which gene positions have been artificially randomized (maroon bars), where synteny blocks are defined as maximal collections of ortholog pairs where pairs of adjacent orthologous pairs have no more than 40 non-participating genes intervening between them. Figure S7.2: HMM segmentation example Each graph plots the rank order of human genes along four human chromosome arms (horizontal coordinate) versus the rank position of the B. floridae mutual-best-hit ortholog within five clusters of B. floridae scaffolds. Vertical red lines indicate the boundaries between human chromosome arms, and horizontal red lines indicate boundaries between scaffold clusters. Discontinuities in the distribution of orthologous gene positions within chromosome arms identified by a hidden Markov model are indicated by the addition of vertical black lines on the right. These discontinuities are most easily explained by chromosomal fusions or large-scale re-arrangements in the human lineage that are recent compared to the time scale of gene order evolution. Figure S7.3: Clustering method for constructing putative ancestral linkage groups (PALs) Blue dots mark the position in human chromosome segments (vertical coordinate) and the Nematostella scaffolds (horizontal coordinate) of a pair of orthologous genes. Nematostella scaffolds and human chromosome segments have been ordered by a hierarchical clustering procedure, and concatenated together. Gene positions are in rank order rather than base pair coordinate, where only genes descended from the set of 7,766 ancestral gene clusters have been numbered. Descendants of ancestral eumetazoan clusters with more than 25 genes from the six representative animal genomes were excluded from the analysis. Horizontal and vertical lines divide clusters of human chromosome segments and Nematostella scaffolds defined by having an average pairwise correlation coefficient of their distribution of hits to the other genome greater than 0.2. The trees along the left and top of the plot are graphical representations of the average pairwise correlation scores among the hierarchically clustered human segments (left) and Nematostella scaffolds (top). Terminal branches are centered Figure S7.4: Detail of Human chromosome 12 showing genes contributing to PAL A. Detail of main text figure 4c, showing the region flanking the HOX C gene cluster on human Chromosome 12. Horizontal tick marks indicate positions of human genes descended from the set of 7,766 inferred ancestral genes. Genes with an ortholog in Nematostella on scaffolds 26, 61, 53, 46, 3 and 5 are labeled and connected by a colored line to the position of the Nematostella ortholog (See Fig 4c), except where the gene falls into an ancestral metazoan cluster for more than 25 genes from human, frog, fish, fly, nematode and Nematostella (Section S4). These large genes families are more likely to have members showing spurious conserved synteny, since they may have members in many regions of the genome. The genes of the HOX C cluster fall into such a large family, but have been labeled to show the position of the HOX cluster. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 20 Captions for Supplemental Tables Table S1.1 Partial list of the merits of Nematostella as a model organism. Table S2.1 Summary of WGS libraries Shotgun libraries are identified by their four-letter name, which is used as a prefix to the identifier of all reads from the library. For each library, the table lists: the mean size of genomic DNA inserts in base pairs; the number of sequencing reads attempted for each library; the number of reads with at least 100 bp of high-quality sequence after removal of vector and low-quality sequence, as described previously[Dehal 2002]; the number of reads which have a detected alignment to other reads in the shotgun data set (see discussion above); the number of reads which are placed in the contigs of the assembly; and the mean read length, after trimming. Column totals are shown in bold for selected columns, and the fraction of reads lost to trimming, lack of alignment, and lack of placement in the assembly is shown as a percentage of the previous total. Table S2.2: Summary of tandem repeat elements from raw WGS reads. Paired fosmid end reads were screened for highly abundant 16-mer DNA words appearing in both ends of fosmid clones, indicating their presence in the genome in large tandem arrays. Identified 16-mers were assembled with JUGGERNAUT, and their abundance in the whole genome shotgun reads was estimated by alignment to a sample of WGS reads from all libraries using BLAST (19). Table S2.3. Transposable elements in the sea anemone genome. Table S3.1: Summary of gene model statistics For Nematostella Filtered Models 1.0 Table S3.2: Compared abundances of PFAM domains for selected domains. The number of proteins with PFAM (45) hits to 10 abundant PFAM domains, along with the abundance rank of that PFAM domain in each genome, is compared among five metazoan genomes, including Nematostella. Table S3.3: Preferentially retained PFAM domains within recent tandem expansions in Nematostella Tandem gene expansions were identified based on 4DTv as described in the text. PFAM domains with a significantly greater number of observed examples among tandem expansions in the Nematostella genome relative to the prediction of a model of the neutral expectation are shown. Table S3.4: Preferentially retained PFAM domains within recent tandem expansions in Homo sapiens Tandem gene expansions were identified based on 4DTv as described in the text. PFAM domains with a significantly greater number of observed examples among tandem expansions in the human genome relative to the prediction of a model of the neutral expectation are shown. Table S5.1: Data sources for phylogenetic analysis Table S6.1: Four-way intron conservation comparison Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 2007 21 The distribution of 4,951 introns in highly conserved, orthologous peptide sequences from human, Drosophila melanogaster, and C. elegans, and Nematostella. The first four lines list the total number of introns in each species, followed in parentheses by the number that are unique to that species. The remaining table rows list the number of introns shared by selected combinations of genomes. Table S7.1: Table of human chromosome segments used in large-scale synteny search A list of the human genome segments used in that PAL analysis. For each segment, the segment name, the human chromosome, and the start and end points on the chromosome, in base pair coordinates on the NCBI Human genome build 36. Table S7.2: Complete Oxford Grid for Human-Nematostella comparison "Oxford grid" which tabulates the number of ancestral gene clusters shared between the 22 Nematostella scaffolds (columns) and 14 segments of the human genome (rows) that are assigned to PALs A, B and C. Cell colors indicate Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.01 (yellow), < 0.05 (pink), < 0.5 (blue). Table S7.3: The 225 ancestral gene clusters linked with the HOX clusters in PAL-A: Table S7.3 is available as SOM 2 on the Science web site. The table lists the inferred ancestral eumetazoan genes that show ancient conserved linkage with both the vertebrate HOX clusters and Nematostella scaffolds 3 and 61. Each row lists the internal ID number of the cluster, followed by the number of recognized descendant genes in each of the representative genomes used in the analysis, separated by commas: Human, Xenopus tropicalis, Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Nematostella; the genes in each of these species, separated by a semi-colon, with alternative identifiers for the same gene separated by a forward slash. Table S8.1: Table of functional categories enriched for novel genes of the three types. Panther ontology annotations of the inferred ancestral gene set have been tested for enrichment in each of the three categories of novelty (novel sequence, novel domain, and novel combination of domains), as described in section S8, and significant over-and under-representations have been tabulated here for (A) Panther Ontology Terms for Biological Process and Molecular Function, and (B) Panther Pathways. For each term with a significant over or under representation, the table shows: the ontology term ID from the Panther system; the natural log of the p-value for the enrichment; a "+" or "-" to indicate over-and under-representation, respectively; the number of inferred ancestral genes which both have the annotation in question, and belong to the category of novelty being considered [N(ont & cat)]; the number of inferred ancestral genes which have the annotation in question [N(ont)]; the number of inferred ancestral genes belonging to the category of novelty being considered [N(cat)] ; the total number of inferred ancestral genes [N(total) ; the percentage of novelties of the category being considered which are annotated with the ontology term [N(ont & cat)/N(cat)] ; the percentage of all ancestral genes which are annotated with the ontology term [N(ont)/ N(cat)]; and a short description of the ontology term.

TSPAN31 Table S1.1: Partial list of the merits of Nematostella as a model organism Developmental Biology  •  short generation time (8-10 weeks from fertilization to spawning) •  sexes are separate; sex determination is stable •  prolific sexual and asexual reproduction in the lab •  rapid regeneration and ease of generating clonal populations •  in situ hybridization protocols have been optimized Genomic Approaches •  relatively small genome (450 million base pairs haploid size) •  most primitive living eumetazoan •  outgroup to other animal genomic models (fly, mouse, nematode) •  most developmental gene families known from other animal systems have been found •  gene families generally appear simpler (fewer members) than in bilaterians •  cDNA and BAC libraries available •  EST projects under way, along with those from other Cnidarians Population Genetics and Ecology •  easily collected over a wide geographic range well documented since the 1950s •  representative of benthic marine invertebrates with sessile adults and planktonic larvae •  collected in both pristine and polluted sites •  native versus invasive populations may be compared •  asexual reproduction & gravid state are easily visualized in transparent animals  Table S2.1: Summary of WGS libraries ID Insert (bp) N Reads N Trimmed Reads N reads with alignments N placed Mean trimmed read length AFII 3149 7658 6867 4839 4035 574 AOWB 2840 1764309 1554340 1026838 880357 630 ATSY 2840 993061 881391 573406 494101 624 AFIK 6489 1864687 1549006 1076195 901598 640 ATWA 6489 915891 834861 592875 500265 709 AFIN 35000 163392 111408 66999 58809 525 ASYG 35000 209087 175771 92574 80041 613 AUNF 35000 50688 40845 35617 31468 656 AXOW 35000 19200 16536 14483 12810 666 AZGY 35000 9216 7056 5664 5001 658 5997189 5178081 3489490 2968485-14%-33%-15% Table S2.2: Summary of tandem repeat elements Element name len(bp) %WGS Est.
