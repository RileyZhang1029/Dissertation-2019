Self-sustaining laboratory cultures can be maintained year-round in artificial seawater,with daily feedings of brine shrimp (3, 4). While sexes are separate, they are not obviouslymorphologically distinguishable.
Nematostella is unique among cnidarians in that it can be induced tospawn repeatedly on a regular cycle in the laboratory to produce large numbers of gametes that can bemanipulated by simple in vitro fertilization methods (4). Fertilization is followed by cell divisionsresulting in a hollow blastula, which gastrulates by invagination and ingression to produce a ciliated,tear-drop-shaped planula larva that swims with an apical tuft of sensory cilia at the front and theblastopore at the rear (Figure S1.1 a-e, h, i). On the seventh day after fertilization, the planuladevelops into a juvenile polyp, with the blastopore becoming the mouth (3, 5, 6) (Figure S1.1f). Thismetamorphosis results in a four-tentacled juvenile polyp with two mesenteries (partitions that partially Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20072divide the gut and increase its surface area, also providing pouches for the production and storage ofgametes), with sexual maturity reached in 3-4 months.
Mature adults are hollow tubes typically 5-10cm in length, with eight mesenteries and an open (oral) end encircled by 10-20 tentacles a few cmlong, and a closed (aboral) end (Figure S1.1l). The animals are carnivorous, capturing and consumingplankton, including small animals and their larvae, using tentacles and the characteristic stinging cellsof cnidarians, which inject neurotoxin into prey.
Asexual reproduction can be induced by tying a fine thread around the body tube.
Within a few days,the animal will separate into two individuals, producing both a new mouth and basal disc.
As with othercnidarians, Nematostella possesses considerable regenerative abilities, reconstituting a complete andproperly proportioned adult from only a part of the animal.
Tentacles can also regenerate when cut.
Itis not known how tentacle number or body tube length is regulated, either in regeneration orembryogenesis. Voucher specimens of siblings of the original parental strain have been deposited inseparate sexes at the Peabody Museum at Yale, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. The sample numbersare as follows: YPM Nos.
39180, 39181, 39182, 39183.Table S1.1 contains a partial list of the merits of Nematostella as a model organism.Figure S1.1 MethodsNematocyst staining (Figure S1.1 g): (Methods adapted from (7)) Juvenile and small adult Nematostellapolyps were relaxed in 7.14% MgCl2 in dH2O for ten minutes and then washed quickly three times in1X PBS with 10mM EDTA. They were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTAfor one hour at 4oC. After washing three times for five minutes each in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA, theanimals were stained in a 200uM DAPI solution in 1X PBS for thirty minutes.
Animals were mounted in70% glycerol in Ptw after washing three times for five minutes each in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA.In situ hybridization (Figure S1.1 j,k): In situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (8).Supplement S2: Genome sequencing and characterizationSource material for genome sequencingGenomic DNA was prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau from larval F1 progeny of CH2 malesand CH6 females.
These parental strains  clones of which are widely available today in at least fourlaboratories and can be readily redistributed  are from the original colony established and maintainedby Cadet Hand at the Bodega Bay Marine Laboratory in the early 1990 s (3). Because commensals orsymbionts have been reported for Nematostella, gametic or embryonic DNA is preferred to avoidcontamination from symbionts and/or undigested food.
DNA from the same preparation was used tocreate a BAC library, described below.
Thanks to asexual reproduction, the haplotypes represented inthe draft genome sequence and BAC library [see below] can be propagated indefinitely.CHORI BAC libraryA Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library, CHORI-219, was produced by Drs. Baoli Zhu and Pieterde Jong at the Children s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI). This library provides a ten-foldcoverage of the genome.
The average size of the inserts in the library is 168 kb. Funding forconstruction of the library was provided by a grant from the NSF (Robert Steele, PI, Ulrich Technau, Co-PI). The library is available through the CHORI BACPAC resource (http://bacpac.chori.org). Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20073Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) Sequencing and Assembly.The genome of Nematostella vectensis was sequenced and assembled by whole genome shotgun (WGS)(9) as previously described (10). Briefly, genomic DNA prepared as described above was used to createshotgun libraries with inserts of approximately 3,000 bp, 6,500 bp and 35,000 bp. The libraries used,their mean insert sizes, and the numbers of reads sequenced are listed in Table S2.1. The shotgunreads were trimmed of low quality and vector-derived sequence, and assembled using JAZZ (10, 11). Approximately one third of the shotgun reads are composed entirely of high copy-number repeatsequences, and are therefore masked at the alignment stage of JAZZ, and therefore remainunassembled. Table S2.2 lists 10 abundant tandemly repeated sequences in the shotgun dataset whichtogether account for 32% of shotgun reads.The assembled genome contains a total of 59,124 contiguous reconstructed sequences ( contigs ) witha total length of 297 million base pairs (Mbp) and 10,804 scaffolds , or reconstructed fragments of thegenome that include gaps of unknown sequence, with a total length of 356 Mbp. Half of the contigsequence is contained in the largest 3,617 contigs, which are all at least 19,835 bp in length (N50). Half of the total scaffold sequence is contributed by the largest 181 scaffolds, which are each at least472 Kbp in length.PolymorphismTo avoid contamination from commensal microbes common to adult anemones and minimize the impactof allelic variation on assembly quality, we prepared genomic DNA from the larvae of a single matingpair originally isolated from the same lagoon.
Our dataset thus nominally contains up to four alleles ateach locus.
From the shotgun assembly and the analysis of alignments between shotgun reads, wemeasured a rate of single nucleotide polymorphism among the four parental alleles as 0.8%, or 1/125bp, approximately ten times the SNP rate in the human population.
Some 16,000 SNPs may besearched at the SNP browser available at StellaBase (http://stellabase.org) (12). After correcting forsampling, we estimated that each pair of alleles differs at 0.65% of nucleotide positions (Figure S2.3). Thus the parental anemones whose genomes we sampled have somewhat less allelic variation thanbroadcast spawning invertebrates such as sea squirts ( 2%) (10) and sea urchins (5-10%) (13), oroutbreeding plants like Populus ( 2%) (14), but a comparable amount to the pufferfish (0.5%) (11). Nematostella, however, is not a true broadcast spawner, since while males release sperm into thewater, females lay tens to hundreds of eggs encased in a jelly mass that becomes fixed to a benthicsubstrate. The egg mass may be a derived feature of Nematostella that is related to its colonization ofthe estuarine environment.
The relatively low level of intra-specific genetic variation in Nematostellavs. marine broadcast spawners might be explained if its estuarine habitat limited gamete dispersal andled to a smaller effective population size.
Genetic fingerprinting of wild Nematostella populationsindicates a high degree of genetic structuring at fine spatial scales, implying extremely low levels ofgene flow between neighboring estuaries (15). The source population for the genome sequence (RhodeRiver, Maryland) appears typical in this regard (16). After correcting for ascertainment bias, we estimate that 0.85% of four-fold degenerate sites inpredicted proteins are polymorphic in the sampled haplotypes (Figure S2.1). Approximately 0.8% ofpositions in the assembly contain a polymorphic site (Figure S2.2), and we estimate that the meanpairwise variation between the four alleles represented in the libraries is 0.64 % (Figure S2.3).We estimate that no more than 5 to 10 percent of the genome is represented redundantly in theassembly due to locally higher rates of heterozygosity between alleles.
This estimate is an upper boundbecause some apparent splits between haplotypes are likely to be recently duplicated regions (17). Toarrive at this estimate we compared EST contigs to the assembly, the predicted protein sequences toone another, and the assembled scaffolds to one another.
839 (11%) of the EST contigs hadalignments of at least 95% identity spanning at least 75% of their length with multiple locations in the Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20074assembly. 4421 predicted genes share at least 99% amino acid identity with another predicted gene.
If all these models are assumed to be alternate alleles, this corresponds to from 5% to 11% of locibeing represented in multiple alleles.
Finally, 898 randomly sampled 2 KB fragments of the assemblythat did not include any sequence gaps were aligned to the whole assembly.
132, or 14.7% of thesampled sequences, had alignments of at least 90% identity, covering at least 75% of their length to 1,2 or 3 (other) locations in the assembly.
The vast majority hit a single second location in the assembly,indicating that  8% of genomic loci are represented in multiple alleles in the assembly.
Expressed sequence tag (EST) library preparation, sequencing, andassemblyTwo mixed stage cDNA libraries for Nematostella were prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technauand Thomas W. Holstein, cloning polyA RNA from unfertilized eggs through metamorphosis into pSPORT6.1 (non-normalized library) and pBS-SK(+) (normalized library). The non-normalized library contains56 million colony-forming units (cfu) at a concentration of 4.7 million cfu/ml. The average insert size ofthe library is 1.96 kb, with greater than 99.5% recombinant. The normalized library was prepared fromthe same source of RNA has an average insert size of 0,9 kb and contains 6.5x105 cfu. In addition,several cDNA libraries were prepared from stage-specific RNA provided by Mark Q. Martindale. Detailedinformation about the libraries can be obtained upon request.Two mixed stage cDNA libraries for Nematostella was prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau cloning polyA RNA from unfertilized eggs through metamorphosis into pSPORT 6.1.
The library contains56 million colony-forming units (cfu) at a concentration of 4.7 million cfu/ml. The average insert size ofthe library is 1.96 kb, with greater than 99.5% recombinant, and an estimated 75% full length basedon pilot sequencing.
Of 1,152 sample sequences, 99.9% were passing, and 80% possessed significantBLASTX hits (E-value  1E-5). 780 contigs were produced, with 680 single clones the most abundantsequence was EF-1a, found in 3% of the sample, indicating that even without normalization this libraryhas a relatively low level of redundancy.
To enable the characterization of gene structures and to provide resources for further study, 88,704cDNA clones from the library were end-sequenced to provide 146,095 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The ESTs were clustered and assembled into 30,813 contigs via the JGI EST pipeline.
Of these, 7,925contigs were found to have a complete (start codon to stop codon) open reading frame (ORFs) of atleast 450 bp. These putatively full-length EST contigs were aligned to the assembled WGS scaffoldsusing BLAT (18) (-maxIntron=100000 -extendThroughN). To evaluate the completeness of the WGS assembly with respect to this collection of ESTs, weconsidered the number of putative full length EST contigs aligned to the genome at varying levels ofcompleteness. For alignments of at least 95% sequence identity, 7,738 (97.6%) had an alignmentspanning at least 25% of the length of the EST contig, 7,557 (95.4%) had an alignment spanning atleast 75% of the length of the EST contig, and 7,193 (90.8%) had an alignment spanning at least 95%of the length of the EST contig. 138 of the 222 EST contigs that lacked an alignment over at least 50%of their length had an identifiable alignment to human refseq genes by BLASTP (19) (-e 1e-5),indicating that they are likely to represent bona fide protein-coding transcripts rather than artifactualsequence. Others may be contaminants of the EST library, or novel genes.For Mnemiopsis leidyi, a cDNA library was created from total RNA prepared from gastrula stageembryos and reversed transcribed with oligo-dT primers and the ZAP cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene)by Kevin Pang and Mark Martindale. cDNA fragments with sizes ranging from 500-2000 base pairswere cloned into pBluescript SK, and 15,360 paired clone end sequences were generated at JGI. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20075Repeat sequences reconstructed from unassembled WGS readsRepeats were identified by assembling 16-mers (DNA sequences of length 16 bp) that frequentlyoccurred in both ends of a sample of 50,000 fosmid clones from the ASYG library.
Any 16-mers thatoccurred in both ends of at least 20 clones were used in the assemblies.
The assemblies wereperformed using juggernaut.pl, a script developed for this purpose.
tRNAScan-SE (20) was used tolook for tRNAs and BLASTN (19) against nr and Repbase (21) to identify the 5S,18S,28S,U2,U6 RNAs,and two Nematostella transposons (see below). The five elements lacking notes are not identified byeither of these methods.
The tandem array sizes are estimated by calculating the probability that a fosmid end matches therepeat given that its sister does.
This probability can be used to estimate the expected array size (anaverage over multiple arrays in some cases) in terms of the mean fosmid length (37kb). Theseestimates depend on the assumptions of normal cloning behavior for these repetitive sequences.
10 families of tandemly repeated sequences were identified which occur in arrays longer than fosmid-length and account for 32% of the WGS data set.
The key characteristics of these repeats aredescribed in Table S2.2. See the file juggernaut.fasta for the complete sequences of these 10elements, available from JGI Genome Portal (www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella). Transposable elements in the sea anemone genomeTransposable elements (TEs) constitute more than 26% of the assembled sea anemone genome (TableS2.3) and belong to  500 families.
These families are composed of a small number of copies (from 1to 5,000) and they all are relatively young: elements from the oldest families are less than 15%divergent from their consensus sequences and their ORFs coding for transposases, reversetranscriptases, and other transposon-specific proteins are not severely damaged by mutations.In terms of their bulk contribution to the genome size, DNA transposons are fourfold more abundantthan retrotransposons (Table S2.3). However, while different classes of anemone retrotransposons,including Gypsy, DIRS, Penelope, and CR1, are composed of more than 50-100 families each, just a fewfamilies represent different classes of autonomous DNA transposons. It appears that retrotranspositionof retrotransposons, despite their high diversity, has not been as efficient as propagation of DNAtransposons in the anemone genome.The variety of different types of DNA transposons found in the anemone genome is the highest amongeukaryotic species studied so far.
Representatives of all reported superfamilies and groups of eukaryoticDNA transposons (22-24), excluding the Transib superfamily and the Mariner group of the Marinersuperfamily, are present in the anemone genome.
Even, En/Spm (also called CACTA) and transposons,which were believed to populate plants genomes only (22), reside in the anemone genome.
While theanemone 10,632-bp EnSpm-1_NV and 9,347-bp EnSpm-2_NV transposons encode transposases(TPase) similar to the plant En/Spm TPase and are flanked by 3-bp targets site duplications typical forknown En/Spm elements, their 5 -CACAG termini differ from the 5 -CACTA termini of the planttransposons.Over 3% of the anemone genome is made of fossilized copies of self-synthesized Polinton DNAtransposons whose transposition depends on the Polinton-encoded DNA polymerase and integrase (25).It makes Nematostella the first metazoan with Polintons constituting a substantial portion of thegenome (25).Remarkably, the sea anemone genome is a safe haven for unusual transposons that have never been Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20076seen before.
For instance, Troyka, a novel type of LTR retrotransposons distantly related to the Gypsysuperfamily, is characterized by 3-bp target site duplications (TSDs), while all known LTRretrotransposons, including retroviruses, are defined by 4-6 bp TSDs (22). Among DNA transposons,the hAT superfamily is well-known for TSDs that are always 8 bp long (22). However, the sea anemonegenome, in addition to the canonical hAT transposons contains two novel groups, hAT5 and hAT6,characterized by 5- and 6-bp TSDs, respectively.
Importantly, using reverse transcriptase/integrase andtransposase encoded by the anemone Troyka, hAT5, and hAT6 transposons as queries in TBLASTNsearches against GenBank DNA sequences, we found that proteins closest to the queries ( 30% proteinidentity) are encoded by TEs characterized by the same unusual lengths of TSDs. For instance, Troykaretrotransposons are present also in sea urchin, and the hAT5 and hAT6 transposons are wide spread insea urchin, sea squirts and lancelet.The anemone genome is also populated by a novel superfamily of eukaryotic cut and paste DNAtransposons, called IS4EU, characterized by their TPase distantly related to the bacterial IS4 TPase.Following identification of the IS4EU TEs in the anemone genome, members of this superfamily havebeen also found in other species, including lancelet.Analyzing anemone TEs, we have also advanced in our understanding of evolution of non-LTRretrotransposons (Fig. S2.4). For instance, the anemone genome harbors two families of Tx1-like non-LTR retrotransposons, Tx1-1_NV and Tx1-2_NV, inserted in 5S rRNA and U2 smRNA, respectively, attarget sites identical to those of different Tx1 elements in fish (26), frog and lancelet. We suggest thatTx1-like elements form a novel clade of non-LTR retrotransposons differing from the L1 clade elementsby the strong target-site specificity.
RTE is another clade of non-LTR retrotransposons first described a few years ago (22, 27). All knownRTE elements, including those in plants, insects, nematodes, and vertebrates, contain only one ORF andare characterized by extremely frequent 5 truncations of the RTE elements during theirretrotransposition. Here, we show that the anemone genome contains several families of RTE-likeelements, RTEX in Fig.S2.4, which are longer than canonical RTE elements and contain an additionalORF at their 5 terminal portion that codes for the esterase domain, analogously to elements from theCR1/L2 clade (28). Transposable Element Analysis MethodsTransposable elements were identified using WU-BLAST (http://blast.wustl.edu) and its implementationin CENSOR (http://girinst.org/censor/). First, we detected all fragments of the anemone genome codingfor proteins similar to transposases, reverse transcriptases, and DNA polymerases representing allknown classes of TEs. The detected DNA sequences have been clustered based on their pairwiseidentities by using BLASTclust (standalone NCBI BLAST (19)). Each cluster has been treated as apotential family of TEs described by its consensus sequence.
The consensus sequences were builtautomatically based on multiple alignments of the cluster sequences expanded in both directions andmanually modified based on structural characteristics of known TEs. Using WU-BLAST/CENSOR weidentified fragments of the anemone genome similar to the consensus sequences that were consideredas copies of TEs. Second, given the identified consensus sequences, we detected automaticallyinsertions longer than 50-bp present in the identified copies of the protein-coding TEs. The insertionshave been treated as potential TEs, clustered based on their pairwise DNA identities and replaced bytheir consensus sequences built for each cluster.
After manual refinements of the consensus sequences,the identified families of TEs were classified based on their structural hallmarks, including target siteduplications, terminal repeats, encoded proteins and similarities to TEs classified previously.
IdentifiedTEs are deposited in Repbase (21). Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20077Chromosome NumberThe synchronous cell divisions during early development of Nematostella allowed easy access to largenumbers of metaphase plates.
Due to loss or overlapping of individual chromosomes, counts tend tounderestimate the actual numbers.
The analysis shows, however, that the great majority of countsshowed 2n = 30 chromosomes (Fig. S2.5). Interestingly, as in Hydra, the chromosomes do not differsignificantly in size, which makes it difficult to create a reliable karyotype. No evidence ofmorphologically distinct sex chromosomes was found.
Based on the estimated genome size of 457 Mb,the average size of a chromosome is in the range of 30.5 Mb.The number of chromosomes found in Nematostella is roughly in the range of what has been reportedfrom other cnidarians: a diploid chromosome set of 30 has been determined in several representativesof the genera Hydra and Pelmatohydra (29-31), which (with the exception of Hydra viridis) have a 3-4fold larger genome size.
The chromosome counts from 24 hydrozoan and one scyphozoan speciesapparently can be anything from 2n = 12 to 32 (reviewed in (32)). Among anthozoans the karyotypesof Aptasiomorpha sp. (2n = 32), several Acropora species (2n = 28) and two species of Anthopleura(2n = 18) have been reported (33-35).Supplement S3: Gene predictionGene prediction and quality controlThe genome of Nematostella vectensis includes 27,273 predicted gene models built using the JGIAnnotation Pipeline, described below.
The genomic sequence, predicted genes and annotations ofNematostella, together with available evidence, are available at the JGI Genome Portal(www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella).The JGI Annotation Pipeline was used for annotation of the v1.0 Nematostella assembly described here.The pipeline includes the following annotation steps: (1) repeat masking, (2) mapping ESTs, full lengthcDNAs, and putative full length genes, (3) gene prediction using several methods, (4) proteinannotation using several methods, and (5) combining gene predictions into a non redundantrepresentative set of gene models, which are subject to genome-scale analysis.Transposons were masked in the Nematostella assembly using RepeatMasker (36) tools and a customlibrary of manually curated repeats (deposited in RepBase (21)). 146,095 ESTs were clustered into30,813 consensus sequences and both individual ESTs and consensus sequences were mapped ontogenome assembly using BLAT (18).Annotation of Nematostella v1.0 was based on several gene predictors  ab initio FGENESH (37),homology-based FGENESH+ (37), homology-based GENEWISE (38), and available ESTs.A set of 1,678 genes derived from EST clusters with a putative full length ORF was directly mapped tothe genomic sequence to build gene models.
FGENESH was trained on this set to achieve sensitivityand specificity of 81% and 80%, respectively.
To generate homology-based gene models, proteins fromthe NCBI NR database were aligned against genomic sequence using BlastX (19). High quality seedproteins were then used to build models using FEGENESH+ and GENEWISE. GENEWISE gene modelswere then filtered to remove models with frame shifts and internal stop-codons and extended to includestart and stop codons where possible.
FGENESH, FGENESH+ and GENEWISE gene models were thenprocessed using ESTEXT to correct them according to splicing patterns observed in available ESTs andto extend 3 and 5 UTR of the genes.All gene models were annotated by homology to other proteins from NCBI NR, SwissProt and KEGG Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20078databases. Using InterproScan (39) we predicted proteins domains.
Using both these sources ofinformation, annotation of each protein was mapped to the terms of Gene Ontology (40), KOG clustersof orthologs (41), and mapped to KEGG pathways (42).The large set of all predicted models was reduced to a non-redundant set of 27,273 representativemodels (Filtered Models), where a single best gene model according to the criteria of homology and ESTsupport describes every locus.
For this set of representative gene models we assigned GO (40) termsto 12,786 proteins, 16,625 (78%) proteins to KOG clusters (41), and 695 distinct EC numbers wereassigned to 2,822 proteins mapped to KEGG pathways (42). Table S3.1 summarizes the set ofpredicted genes.The data are available from JGI Genome Portal (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella) and has beendeposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the project accession ABAV00000000. The version describedin this paper is the first version, ABAV01000000.Gene ContentHuman Genes Sharing Ancestry with Nematostella GenesTo determine the number of genes in the Nematostella genome, we estimated how many of the 27,273predicted gene models represent unique genes in the genome, as opposed to spurious gene predictions,fragmentary gene models, pseudogenes or unrecognized transposable element sequence.
First, theNematostella gene models were divided into categories based on the quality of their hits to the humanproteome. Specifically we define the best C-value , for each Nematostella gene, to be the ratio of theBLAST score of its best hit to the human genome to the highest BLAST score of the best-hitting humangene to any Nematostella gene.
The number of genes with best C-value greater than or equal to Cmin,for Cmin from 0 to 1, is plotted in Figure S3.1 for two choices of BLAST e-value threshold.
This value isby construction equal to 1 for genes with a mutual best, and the human and Nematostella curvesconverge at Cmin=1 for each choice of e-value.
At the opposite extreme of Cmin=0, the curves reachthe total number of genes with detectable alignment in the other genome.
If a species has undergone extensive 'paralog-formation', for example by a genome duplication relativeto the other, we will expect the curve for genes of the 'duplicated' species hitting genes of the'unduplicated' species being above the vice versa, for ranges 0.8 = Cmin 1, i.e. the 'co-orthologs'range, as we observe for human in the plot.If the curve for a species does not flatten as Cmin - 0 this means that there are many genes in thatspecies having low best C-values, which is what we expect for pseudogenes and/or transposons wherepartial gene predictions have been made.
For Nematostella, this curve shows a large excess, exceedingthe human curve for values of Cmin  0.5, while falling below human at high Cmin values.
To asseswhether the excess of gene models with low best C-value in Nematostella reflect the contribution of alarge number of small, fragmentary models and pseudogenes, 60 Nematostella genes were subjected toa detailed manual review.
Twenty genes were selected at random from the JGI Nematostella FilteredModels version 1.0 ( FM1.0 set ) in each of the following categories:1) BCV (best C-value to human) = 0, meaning no BLAST hit to human.
5486 of the FM1.0 set have BCV= 0.2) 0  BCV  0.4.
4889 of the FM1.0 set.3) BCV = 0.4.
18274 of the FM1.0 set.Manual review is by definition somewhat subjective, but using conservative criteria, i.e. avoidingdismissing too many genes, the results of the sampling indicate that about one third of all genes in theFM1.0 set could be expected to be rejected by manual reviews.
Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 20079Category 1), 8 of the 20 were deemed real genes , i.e. from the total number of genes with BCV = 0we would expect  0.4 * 5489 = 2194 genes to pass manual scrutiny.
Note that 15 of the 20 in thiscategory have 1 or 2 exons.Category 2). 10 of 20 were deemed real.
11 of the 20 have 1 or 2 exons.
Predicted # genes to passmanual review: 4889 * 0.5 = 2445Category 3). These are high BCV genes, 13 of which have BCV  0.8.
Here, 15 of the 20 are thought tobe real genes.
In some cases, it looked like two gene models should be merged, and we tried roughly tocall a gene here every other time, to approximately get the right gene count.
From the counts here, wewould expect  0.75 * 18274 = 13706 genes in this category.Adding up these expected numbers gives us an estimate of 18,345 bona fide Nematostella genes.
Eventhis may be an overestimate, since quite a few of the genes with lower c-values are at the edges ofshort scaffolds, and their other half may be picked up by another scaffold, causing 2 annotations for asingle gene.Additional observations on the Nematostella proteome The human genome has more genes with a mutual best hit in Nematostella than in theproteomes of Ciona, fruit flies or nematodes.
(Figure S3.2) The Nematostella genome contains many proteins with domain architectures (combinations ofPFAM domains) that are shared exclusively with vertebrate genes.
(Figure S3.3) Of the PFAM domains present in human, mouse, dog, chicken, frog and fugu, Nematostella hasmore in common than any of Ciona, fruit fly, or nematode.
(Figure S3.4) There are 5 large clusters of short proteins (around 100aa), each comprising 55-74 memberswith weak similarity to hypothetical short ORFs from fungi (43) There are 242 clusters of tandemly duplicated genes, comprising 2-13 members, with annotatedPfam domains, which apparently were duplicated after split of Bilateria There are 9 neurotoxins genes, with an anemone neurotoxin domain (PF0076) previously foundonly in the Cnidaria, but not previously in Nematostella, and 5 copies of green fluorescentprotein (PF01353), originally found in jellyfish and predominantly found in Cnidaria (44). 16 Pfam domains previously exclusively found only in vertebrates, but not in other bilaterianphyla (or other eukaryotes), are present in Nematostella genome, including:    PF01500 -  Keratin, high sulfur B2 protein                         PF00040 - Fibronectin type II domain    PF06954 -  Resistin    PF06990 -  Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase    PF05038 -  Cytochrome b558 alpha-subunitLineage Specific ExpansionsWe identified 809 recent tandem expansions in the Nematostella genome, comprising 1,854 protein-coding genes.
A similar algorithm applied to the ENSEMBL annotation of the human genome detected504 recent expansions with 1,317 genes.
The algorithm is as follows: first, all genes on chromosomesor scaffolds with three or more annotated genes were numbered in occurring order.
From an all-against-all Smith-Waterman alignment of these peptides, all hits with greater than 60% identity andwith at least 25 conserved four-fold degenerate codons were retained.
This filtering step helps eliminatepseudogenes and spurious hits of low-complexity regions, and allows a divergence epoch estimate forthe pair based on four-fold degenerate transversion frequency (4DTv) (14). Since our focus is onexpansions specific to the Nematostella lineage, we only consider hits with 4DTv  0.2, i.e. 20% or less Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200710observed transversions at four-fold degenerate 3rd codon positions.
Extrapolating from vertebratecalibrations, this corresponds to gene duplications no older than 150-200 million years.Next, the scaffolds were scanned for pairwise hits under the above criteria with no more than threeunrelated genes separating them.
This allows for intervening spurious gene models as well as small-scale inversions.
Finally, all such pairs with one of the genes being within three genes of a member ofanother pair were clustered in a single-linkage fashion.
To assess the probability of detecting tandemexpansions by chance, we repeated this approach on versions of the human and Nematostella gene setsin which the gene order had been randomly scrambled.
We found a single spurious 2-member cluster inNematostella and four in human.
Hence, we expect the false positive rate of this approach to be lessthan 1%.In order to assess to what extent these relatively recent expansions have been retained by positiveselection, and to compare the types of expansions found in Nematostella to those in vertebrates, weperformed the following analysis: first, we scanned all of the genes in the human and Nematostellagene sets for PFAM-A domains using hmmpfam (45). We were able to assign one or more PFAMdomains to 15,102 human genes and 12,202 Nematostella genes.
We then formulated a neutral-evolution hypothesis that any gene has an equal probability of getting duplicated and fixed in thepopulation. For genes with a certain domain we can then test the validity of this hypothesis bycomparing the frequencies of such genes in the recent expansions to the overall frequency.
Forexample, the number of recently created genes in Nematostella containing a PF000001 seven trans-membrane family (rhodopsin family) domain is 33 (subtracting one seed member of each tandemcluster). Since 779 of the 12,202 Nematostella genes contain this domain, the expected number in therecently expanded set (with a total of 572 genes with PFAM domains) under the neutral hypothesis is36.5 +- 5.8, where the binomial approximation has been used since the recent genes constitutes asmall fraction of the total genes in both species.
Hence, in Nematostella, there is no evidence for recentselection for retention of new genes created by tandem duplication with PF000001. In the humangenome, on the other hand, 112 such genes are observed, with an expected value of 29 +- 5.3,consistent with a strong recent selective retention of such receptors (olfactory and visual) withinvertebrates or mammals.
Tables S3.3 (Nematostella) and S3.4 (human) show all PFAM domains foundin at least four genes in recent tandem expansions, and with a frequency of at least 3 sigma above theexpected frequency under the neutral hypothesis.
In general, the gene families showing strongexpansions along the two lineages are different.
In addition to olfactory and taste receptors, the humangenome shows strong recent preference of C2H2 zinc finger genes with a KRAB domain, keratin, andimmune defense proteins.
This newly acquired repertoire almost certainly plays a key role in definingvertebrates and mammals.
Similarly, the genes listed in Table S3.3 can be hypothesized to play asignificant role in distinguishing Nematostella. Note that this analysis is biased towards vertebrates, forwhich more domains have been characterized.Supplement S4: Construction and characterization of eumetazoangene familiesA simple way to identify putative orthologs (genes descended from the same gene in the commonancestor) between genomes is through reciprocal best-scoring BLAST hits.
The human genome hasmore such orthologous pairs with Nematostella (6,989) than with non-vertebrate bilaterians, includingDrosophila (5,772), C. elegans (4,846), and even the invertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis (6,313). To understand gene creation and duplication we designed a phylogenetically informed clusteringalgorithm that produces clusters at the base (most distant in time) and tip (most recent point) of agiven internal branch (stem) of the species tree.
Each cluster is composed of a group of modern genesthat are the offspring of one gene in the common ancestor.
Our algorithm takes as input:a) The genomes that have arisen as descendants from our stem of interest.
These are our in-groupgenomes.b) Other genomes that serve as phylogenetic out-groups.c) Pairwise alignment scores for all pairs of genes in the in- and out-groups.
Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200711d) Any previous clusterings made of the in-group genomes we want to preserve.From this data our algorithm operates as follows:i) A graph is made where each node is an in-group gene.
Edges are added if two genes are mutualbest hits between species.
Edges are also added if two genes are in any clusters in input (d).ii) A single linkage clustering is done of the graph.
This represents the clusters at the tip of our stem.
The mutual best hits captures the likely orthologs between the organisms while the clusters passed inas input (d) captures the paralogs from the stems emanating from the tip of the current stem ofinterest.iii) For each cluster made in (ii), the top m hits to the out-groups are found where m = twice thenumber of out-groups.
This collection of out-group genes is called the potential blockers for thiscluster.iv) Two clusters from (ii) are merged if they share at least one potential blocker and for every potentialblocker the genes with which it aligns are closer [by BLAST score] to each other than either is to itspotential blocker.
This gives us a set of clusters that existed at the base of our stem of interest.Blastp was run using BLOSUM45, e-value cutoff 0.001, and filtering was turned off.
Only the top 1500hits were considered if more hits passed these criteria.
The genomes used are as follows:Xenopus tropicalis JGI v4.1Takifugu rubripes JGI v4.0Nematostella vectensis JGI V1.0 (this work)Homo sapiens Ensembl build 38Drosophila melanogaster Ensembl build 38Caenorhabditis elegans Ensembl build 38Arabidopsis thaliana From NCBI on 11/2005Saccharomyces cerevisiae From genome-ftp.stanford.edu, version released on July 7, 2004Dictyostelium discoideum From dictybase.org, Annotations released on 7/11/2005Supplement S5: Phylogenetic analysis of MetazoaWe compared predicted protein sequences from Nematostella to those from other metazoan and out-group genomes, and find that Nematostella genes are more similar to vertebrate genes than to fly andnematode genes using Bayesian branch length estimation and an analysis of percent sequence identity.
((46) came to the same conclusion using ESTs and BLAST e-value to measure similarity.) Of the 7,766ancestral metazoan gene clusters, 1,619 are composed of a single gene from each of the sixrepresentative metazoan genomes listed in Supplement S4: human, fish, frog, Nematostella, fruit flyand nematode.
Starting with this set of apparently single-copy genes in these six genomes, wesearched six additional complete or partial genome sequence data sets (of a tunicate, a gastropodmollusk, a hydrozoan cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, a sponge, and yeast), and a collection of ESTs fromthe ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (see Table S5.1 for a list of data sources) for orthologous genes,making a total of twelve whole genome data sets, plus the EST-derived sequences from Mnemiopsis. For each additional genome, if a mutual-best hit existed to the human gene in the cluster, that genewas identified as an ortholog, and added to the cluster.
We compared the results obtained with this setwith those obtained using Nematostella rather than human as the anchor for identifying orthologs, andfound that it did not change the results.
By this method, 337 ortholog sets were identified that had onegene representing each of the twelve whole genome datasets. Only nine ortholog sets contained onegene from each of the twelve whole genomes plus a Mnemiopsis sequence.We constructed two concatenated multiple sequence alignments from the identified orthologs: one withand one without the ctenophore sequence.
In each case, multiple sequence alignments for eachorthologous set were computed with MUSCLE (47), and well-aligned regions extracted with GBLOCKS(48) using conservative settings (all available sequences in an orthologous group were required to bewell aligned at the start and the end of each extracted block: -b1=N -b2=N, where N is equal to the Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200712number of sequences in the alignment.) We constructed two concatenated multiple alignments forinvestigating metazoan phylogeny and relative rates of protein sequence evolution among the differentlineages. The first (Alignment 1) excludes sequence from the Mnemiopsis ESTs, and includes only the337-ortholog sets with representation from each of the other twelve genomes.
The second (Alignment2) was compiled from the multiple alignments including the Mnemiopsis data and includes all orthologsets with twelve or thirteen members, plus all ortholog sets including a Mnemiopsis sequence.
Alignment 1 consists of 19,563 columns, with no missing data.
This data matrix was analyzed usingmrbayes version 3.1.2 (49, 50), using a the WAG (51) model of protein evolution, a Gammadistribution of rate variation among sites, approximated by four rate categories, and a category forinvariant sites.
Multiple runs from different starting topologies all converged on the same topology,branch lengths and posterior probabilities for protein evolution model parameters within approximately10,000 Monte Carlo iterations.
The mean and variance of the posterior probabilities for total treelength, Gamma distribution shape parameter alpha and the fraction of invariable sites were 2.278 +-0.001, 0.818 +- 0.001, and 0.2291 +- 0.0001, respectively.
Figure S5.1 shows the consensus treetopology and branch lengths.
All nodes were resolved as shown in 100% of the samples trees.
Thesequences of the genes used in Alignment 1 are available in FASTA format in S5.fasta.Alignment 2 consists of 19,977 columns, however only 2272 columns contain Mnemiopsis sequence.
Totest whether this data could be used to shed light additional light on the phylogenetic relationshipsamong cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians, we submitted this dataset to a maximum likelihoodanalysis using the PHYLIP package's PROML program (52), and compared the likelihood scores of threetopologies: ctenophores sister to cnidarians+bilaterians, ctenophores sister to bilaterians, andctenophores sister to cnidarians.
Of these, the first had the highest likelihood score, but it was notsignificantly better than the second in a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.
The branch lengths for the treeshown in Figure 1 were estimated using PROML, for the defined topology illustrated, with a trifurcationat the cnidarian/ctenophore/bilaterian divergence.To make an extremely rough estimate of divergence time between bilaterians and cnidarians, weinterpolated following Dawkins (53) between recent molecular clock estimates (54) of the timing of theprotostome-deuterostome (95% confidence interval: 640-760 Mya) and choanoflagellate-metazoan(95% CI: 760-960 Mya) divergences.
Figure 1 in the main text shows that the cnidarian-bilaterian splitlies 30% of the way between these two nodes (adopting the midpoint rooting as shown), suggestingthat the eumetazoan ancestor lived between 670 and 820 Mya.The relatively slow rate of protein sequence evolution in Nematostella compared to fly and nematodecan be seen more directly by considering the amino-acid percent identity between reciprocal-best-hitsof selected proteomes vs. human.
Despite the fact that flies and nematodes share a more recentcommon ancestor with human than sea anemones do, we find that the anemone peptides are moresimilar to human than to either of the model protostomes (46, 55). Figure S5.1 shows, in a more directway, the greater similarity between human and Nematostella proteins than between human andfly/nematode proteins.Supplement S6: Intron Splice Site ConservationIntron conservation can be unambiguously assessed by identifying well-aligned regions of orthologousproteins that are interrupted by introns in one or more species (Figure 3a). Note that this analysis isprotected from the effects of gene modeling artifacts, since erroneous predictions in the vicinity ofsplice sites would disrupt alignment, thereby removing such sequences from consideration.To study intron loss and gain in orthologous genes in multiple species, we first aligned the Nematostellagene set to the set of human ENSEMBL models (release 26.35.1) and to the TIGR release 5 ofArabidopsis thaliana genes.
In 2,347 cases, a human gene was found to have a mutual best hit to botha Nematostella and an Arabidopsis gene, forming a tentative cluster of orthologous genes to be studiedfurther. Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200713Gene models are often incomplete in the 5 ends and may have poorly determined splice sites, so werestrict our analysis to regions of highly conserved peptides in the orthologs of all three species.
Theindependent identification of such regions in multiple species provides strong evidence for the accuracyof the gene models in these regions.
Hence, we performed multiple alignments of the orthologousclusters and identified gap-free blocks flanked by fully conserved amino acids.
We then identifiedannotated splice sites of all species within these regions, which the additional requirements that 1)none of the peptides must have a gap in the alignment closer than 3 AA from the splice site and 2) notwo different peptides must have splice sites at different positions closer than 4 AA. Empirically, theserequirements are necessary to avoid spurious detection of intron losses due to ambiguities in eitherthe multiple alignment or the gene model s splice sites.
While some of these cases may reflect realsliding of donor or acceptor sites, we restrict ourselves to studying gains and losses of introns here.Finally, we required that at least 5 amino acids out of 10 in the flanking regions of the splice sites beeither fully conserved or have strong functional similarity among all four species.9,947 highly reliable intron splice sites were identified by these requirements.
The results aresummarized as a Venn diagram in figure S6.1, indicating the number of shared introns between thespecies.Remarkably, about 81% of the human introns (4,403 of 5,435) are shared with Nematostella. Assumingthat intron losses have occurred independently in the human and Nematostella lineages, and that theprobability of independent intron insertion events at the same location is negligible we estimate the lossin Nematostella since the last common ancestor (LCA) with human as 158  (158 + 1258) = 11%. In asimilar fashion, we estimate a loss of almost 22% along the human lineage, twice the amount of intronslost in the Nematostella lineage.The above results also allow us to place upper limits on intron gains within the human and Nematostellalineages: 28.6% of all introns shared by human and Nematostella (and hence present in their LCA) arealso shared by Arabidopsis. If additional introns have been independently gained in each lineage weexpect a lower fraction of the total introns in each species to be shared with Arabidopsis. In fact, wefind 26.5% of all Nematostella introns and 26.1% of all human introns are shared with Arabidopsis,which translate into maximum intron gains of 9% in human and 7% in Nematostella. These resultsare strict upper limits, since the lower conservation with Arabidopsis can also be explained if the lossrate varies inherently between introns. In this case we will expect introns that are shared betweenhuman and Nematostella to be less prone to loss, and hence a larger fraction will also have survived inArabidopsis. This scenario is very conceivable since some introns have been shown to containregulatory elements and the loss of such introns would presumably be selected against.
To the extent that the introns in highly conserved peptide regions studied here are representative ofintrons in general, the above analysis suggests that the Nematostella genome has only lost 11% of itsintrons since the LCA with human, and gained at most 7%.We next identified 2,347 clusters of orthologous genes in all bilaterian orthologous clusters with anunambiguous 1:1:1 member relationship in human, Drosophila melanogaster (fly), and C. elegans. In1,523 of these clusters, the human gene had a mutual best hit to a Nematostella gene, forming clustersof four orthologous genes.
4,951 highly reliable introns were identified by these requirements.
Theresults are summarized in Table S6.1. Nematostella has the most introns at these conserved positions,followed by human with a relative intron frequency of about 0.91, whereas nematode and in particularfly have considerably fewer introns (0.37 and 0.21). From these numbers we estimate the intron lossesin fly, nematode, and human since their LCA to be 82% , 77%, and 12% respectively.
Note that thenematode, although having retained only 23% of the introns since the LCA with human have 37% ofthe number of human introns. This suggests a considerable gain of introns in the nematodes, as alsoreported by [Logsdon 2004].This analysis of aligning conserved sequences to identify conservation of introns was further extendedto include seven species - Nematostella vectensis, Homo sapiens, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophilamelanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Arabidopsis thaliana. 4342 Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200714introns from the seven genomes at 2645 aligned positions that contain an intron in at least one of theseven orthologs.Methods for Intron Gain/Loss treeStarting from the binary character matrix compiled as described above of 2,645 intron positions across7 taxa, we found the most parsimonious solution to the intron gain/loss problem by projecting thesecharacters onto the (known) topology.
Weighted parsimony as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10 (56) wasused, with the cost of an intron gain significantly greater (more than 10X) the cost of an intron loss.
The parsimony assignment of characters to internal nodes is independent of this gain/loss weight ratio.
From the branch lengths produced by PAUP, and the known weights, we solved for the number of lossesand gains along each branch as show in the main text figure.Supplement S7: Analysis of anciently conserved gene linkageWe first searched for regions of approximately conserved gene order between Nematostella and human,allowing for local rearrangements as well as independent differential gene loss and/or duplication ineach genome (57). We found 33 conserved syntenic segments, each containing 9 or more orthologousgene pairs, under conditions for which no such segments are expected when gene order is completelyrandomized in the two genomes (Figure S7.1). Within each segment, however, local gene order isconsiderably scrambled.
Further relaxing gene order constraints dramatically increases the number ofsuch segments expected by chance, reducing the power of this approach to detect even more ancientconserved genome organization in the face of intra-chromosomal rearrangements.
To overcome thislimitation we developed a new method to search for statistically significant conserved linkage groupsthat does not rely on gene order.Local conservation of gene orderTo search the human and Nematostella genomes for regions of conserved linkage, we performed thefollowing analysis.
First, the genes on each genome were assigned unique identifiers according to theorder in which they occur on the chromosomes or scaffolds.
We then used the sequence alignmentsdescribed in the clustering section to scan each genome for tandem expanded gene families, definedhere as clusters of genes with a maximum of 4 intervening genes, showing similarity at e-values 1x10-10. All but one member, the longest peptide, were excluded from further analysis at each suchregion in the genomes.From the human vs. Nematostella protein alignments we next excluded all genes with more than 15hits with e-value  1x10-10 from consideration.
Finally, of the remaining pair-wise hits we includedonly hits with a score of more than 70% of the value of the highest score of either of the two genes toany of the genes in the opposite genome.
This approach enriches the set for orthologous gene pairswhile removing weak super-family similarities from the analysis.
At this stage we were left with 11,351pair-wise hits, involving 6,986 Nematostella genes and 8,426 human genes.
We then recalculated thegene order IDs in the two genomes, featuring only the genes involved in these high-quality alignments,and scanned for regions of conserved synteny or linkage in the following manner:For the first pair-wise alignment of genes in the proteomes of the two species, the gene locations on thechromosomes were recorded and a one-pair segment of conserved synteny was defined.
Subsequentgene pairs either defines new segments, or, if the genes in both species are located within a specifiedmaximum distance, Nmax from a gene pair in an existing segment, the pair is added to that segment.If a pair can be added to two segments, these segments are joined into a larger segment of conservedsynteny. Note that this method does not require strict conservation of gene order: inversions on scales Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200715smaller than Nmax are tolerated.
After traversing all alignments, we have a set of conserved regions,on which we can impose a minimum member limit (typical 3 pairs) to remove potentially spuriousregions.For human-Nematostella, we found no strict significant conservation of gene order, but by choosing alarge value of Nmax we nonetheless detect regions of conserved linkage in which the local gene orderhas been scrambled.
In order to detect the significance of these regions, we randomly scrambled theorder of the genes on each chromosome or scaffold and applied, for the same sequence alignment data,the algorithm to the scrambled data set.
This allows us to choose parameters to minimize false positivedetection. Note the importance of the filtering out weak hits in this method, as the presence of such hitswould significantly increase the false positive rate in the detection of segments of conserved linkage.Using Nmax = 40 and considering only segments of 9 or more participating genes, we find 33 suchsegments of conserved synteny between human and Nematostella, with none expected by chance, asseen by running the algorithm on the scrambled set.Identification of human genome segments free of recent chromosomalfusions and large-scale rearrangementsTo facilitate the search for large-scale conservation of gene linkage in the presence of extensivechanges in local gene order between humans and Nematostella, we identified 98 segments of thehuman genome which appear to be uninterrupted by inter-chromosomal translocations or fusions whencompared to the genomes of other chordates.
To identify likely locations of chromosomal fusions alongthe human genome that separate such segments, we followed the following procedure:1. Putatively orthologous gene pairs were identified between the ENSEMBL human gene set and thechordate Branchiostoma floridae draft gene set [JGI web page] using the mutual best BLAST hitcriterion. 2.
Scaffolds of the B. floridae assembly were clustered as described below for Nematostella, based onthe similarity of the distribution in the human genome of human genes orthologous the genes on thescaffold. 3.
A representation of each human chromosome arm was constructed in which each gene along thechromosome was represented by the identifying number of the cluster of scaffolds in which its B.floridae ortholog resides.4. A Hidden Markov Model, constructed and implemented in software for the purpose, was used tosegment the human chromosomes into segments with an approximately uniform distribution of hits to aspecific subset of the scaffold clusters.Figure S7.2 illustrates the results of this procedure for human chromosome arms 14q, 15q, 16p and16q, and Table S7.1 lists the extent of the 98 identified segments in base pair coordinates on the NCBIHuman genome build 36.Construction and Significance Testing of Putative Ancestral Linkagegroups (PALs)To test for conservation of large-scale synteny in the presence of extensive local rearrangement of geneorder, we compared 147 of the largest scaffolds of the Nematostella assembly to the segments of the98 human genome described above.
The examined scaffolds were selected because, like the 98 humansegments, each contains descendants of 40 or more ancestral eumetazoan genes.
For each scaffold-segment pair, we tabulated the number of ancestral gene clusters giving rise to descendants on bothmembers of the pair.
This number counts the number of independent orthologs shared by the scaffoldand the segment.
For each scaffold-segment pair, the number of observed orthologs was compared toa null model in which scaffolds and segments comprise genes descending from genes drawn Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200716independently from the set of 7,766 ancestral genes.
This method of counting orthologs, and this nullmodel control naturally for independent tandem gene duplicates which could otherwise artifactuallyinflate the number of observed orthologs in circumstances where there is no remnant of conservedsynteny, because tandem duplicates arising independently should be contained in a single reconstructedancestral gene cluster.
The expected number of orthologs under this model is governed by thehypergeometric distribution, allowing us to compute a p-value for consistency for each scaffold-segmentcomparison with the null model.
Since we compared 147 scaffolds with 98 segments, we applied aBonferroni correction factor of 1/14406. The complete set of these numbers of shared orthologousgenes are shown in figure S7.3, for all scaffolds (67/147) and segments (40/98) which participated in astatistically significant shared synteny relationship.
Table cell backgrounds are colored yellow when p 0.01/14406, and pink when p  0.05  14406.
A blue background indicates p 0.5/14406.Table S7.3 has 112 yellow cells, corresponding to 112 cases of statistically significant conservation ofsynteny between a Nematostella scaffold and a segment of the human genome.
The rows and columnsof this table have been ordered to reveal 13 sets of scaffolds and chromosome segments, defined bythe criterion that none can be subdivided without separating into different sets a scaffold-segment pairwith significant evidence (p 0.01) for conserved synteny. We interpret these collections of modernsequences to be descended from the same chromosomes, or chromosomal segments of the commonancestor of eumetazoa, and refer to them therefore as putative ancestral linkage groups, or PALs.Table S7.3 lists the 255 ancestral gene clusters linked with the HOX clusters in PAL-A.A clustering method allows more extensive reconstruction of putativeancestral linkage groups.Having demonstrated that there is extensive conservation of linkage relationships among genes usingthe conservative statistical criteria described above, we developed a more sensitive method toreconstruct ancestral linkage groups based on clustering scaffolds or chromosome segments.
In thismethod, a matrix of ortholog counts similar to that shown in figure S7.3 is constructed.
The rows andcolumns of this table are then clustered hierarchically, using Pearson correlation as a measure ofsimilarity and the average pairwise linkage method with the cluster program (58). Figure S7.4 showsthe result as a dot plot as in figure S7.2. Horizontal and vertical lines divide clusters of scaffolds(vertical lines) and human chromosome segments (horizontal lines), defined by a cut of the hierarchicaltree at a correlation coefficient of 0.2.
This clustering of scaffolds and chromosome segments defines15 large PALs, each with descendants of more than one hundred ancestral eumetazoan genes.
3055ancestral genes, or 40% of the ancestral genes are assigned to one of these PALs.Supplement S8: Eumetazoan Ancestry of GenesConstruction of Centroid sequences.We define the centroid of a cluster of orthologous amino acid sequences to be a synthetic amino acidsequence that maximizes the sum of BLAST alignment scores between the centroid and the members ofthe cluster.
This provides a surrogate for the peptide sequence that is ancestral to each cluster.Classification of eumetazoan genes by ancestryCentroids (see above) of the ancestral eumetazoan gene clusters were aligned to non-animal entries in Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200717SwissProt/TREMBL[Uniprot release 8 from http://www.uniprot.org] with BLAST (19), using the NCBItaxonomy database to remove metazoan entries.
The Pfam (45) annotation of SwissProt/TREMBL fromswisspfam [Version of Sept. 6 2006.
Current version available from http://pfam.janelia.org] wasparsed to identify Pfam domains found only in animals, as well as pairs of Pfam domains that occurseparately in non-animals but only were found together in animals.
Clusters whose centroid had a BLAST hit to out-group proteins of e-value 1e-6, and also clusterscontaining a member which is a mutual best hit to an Arabidopsis, Dictyostelium or Saccharomyceswere annotated as ancient, unless one of the following conditions was met:1) if both the Nematostella peptide and at least one other animal protein had an animal specific Pfamdomain, the cluster was designated a type II novelty.2) if both the Nematostella peptide and at least one other animal protein had an animal specific Pfamdomain combination, the cluster was designated a type III novelty.Note that type III (animal-specific eukaryotic domain combinations) are based only on pairwisecombinations. Thus animal proteins that shuffle the order of domains found within an ancienteukaryotic family are not designated as novel in this analysis.Functional annotation of ancestral gene clustersPanther (59, 60) family annotations on the sequences of extant species were transferred to the inferredancestral clusters when both Nematostella and bilaterian members of the clusters shared the samePanther annotation.
These annotations were mapped to various overlapping functional categories usingthe Panther Pathways (60) and Panther Ontology databases.
To asses whether specific functional categories were over- or underrepresented among the differenttypes of novelties, we adapted the GOstat approach of Beissbarth and Speed (61) for use with thePanther ontologies, and computed p-values for enrichment and dearth relative the hypergeometricdistribution. For both Panther Pathways and Panther Ontology, we limited our tests to the 100 ontologyterms which had the greatest number of inferred ancestral genes assigned to them, and applied aBonferroni correction for 100 tests, even though this is somewhat conservative, since the categorieshave significant overlap.

Figure S2.1 shows the observed (read) and Poisson ascertainment bias-corrected(green) frequency of polymorphic 4-fold degenerate sites as a function of local depth of assembly for asampling of 17.3 million 4-fold degenerate codons [Left hand scale]. Positions are consideredpolymorphic if two or more WGS reads indicate each of two or more different bases at a given position.
The blue histogram shows the number of positions considered for each depth of coverage [right handscale].Figure S2.2: Observed density of polymorphic sitesThe rate of single nucleotide polymorphism observed in the assembled genome sequence is 0.8%. Figure S2.2 shows the observed (red) and Poisson ascertainment bias-corrected (green) frequency ofpolymorphic positions as a function of local depth of assembly for a sampling of 14.4 million positions inthe assembly [Left hand scale]. Positions are considered polymorphic if two or more WGS readsindicate each of two or more different bases at a given position.
The blue curve shows the number ofpositions considered for each depth of coverage, and the gray curve shows Poisson distributed countswith the same mean.Figure S2.3: Four-haplotype polymorphism fitThe number of polymorphic sites (red crosses) as a function of local depth of the assembly is comparedwith expected values for four independent haplotypes with average pairwise differences of 0.5%(green), 0.64% (blue) and 0.7% (purple).Figure. S2.4 Neighbor-joining tree of eukaryotic non-LTR retrotransposons constructed fortheir reverse transcriptase. Black circles mark novel families of non-LTR retrotransposons identified inthis study.
Unmarked retrotransposons have been described previously and are collected in RepbaseReports. Abbreviations of host species are as follows: NV, Nematostella vectensis XT, frog Xenopustropicalis BF, lancelet Branchiostoma floridae AG, mosquito Anopheles gambiae DM, fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster DR, fish Danio rerio CR, green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii TP, diatomThalassiosira pseudonana  SP, sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus PS, turtle Platemys spixii SJ,blood fluke Schistosoma japonica Cis, sea squirt Ciona savignyi. Only 40% bootstrap values areshown next to corresponding nodes of the tree (based on MEGA3 (62)). Clades and groups of non-LTRretrotransposons are indicated by black and blue rectangles.Figure S2.5 Number of chromosomesThe number of chromosomes was determined by analyzing over 90 metaphase plates in spreads.
Theconclusion is that 2N = 30, the same number as in Hydra.
A sample metaphase plate is shown, withthe histogram of the number of observed chromosomes per plate.Figure S3.1: Distribution of C-scoreThe number of genes with a best C-value (see section S3) greater than Cmin, or Cmin from zero toone, with alignment e-value threshold Nematostella (red) and human (blue), with BLAST e-valuethreshold 1e-10 (solid curves) and 1e-3 (dashed).Figure S3.2: Number of bidirectional BlastP hits (potential orthologs ) between 22,218 humangenes (from Ensembl) and other organisms with known genomes.
Despite early divergence, seaanemone shares more hits with human, than other bilaterians, except vertebrates.Figure S3.3: Fraction of unique multi (Pfam) domain (2 or more domains) gene models fromNematostella (total 983) shared by other metazoans and yeast.Figure S3.4: 2264 Pfam domains present in all 6 vertebrates with known genomes: human,mouse, dog, chicken, frog and fugu. Below is the histogram of numbers of these domains shared by Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200719Ciona, fly, nematode and sea anemone.Figure S5.1: Distribution of percent ID Against Human ProteinsThe distribution of the percent identity in mutual-best-hit protein alignments between human genes andthe genes of the frog, Xenopus tropicalis, pufferfish Takifugu rubripes, Nematostella, fruit fly Drosophilamelanogaster, and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Figure S6.1: Venn diagram for three-way intron conservation comparisonVenn diagram showing the distribution of 9,947 intron splice sites in Homo sapiens, Nematostellavectensis, and Arabidopsis thaliana.Figure S7.1: Synteny block searchThe size distribution of synteny blocks for human vs. Nematostella (blue bars) is compared to that for asynthetic data set in which gene positions have been artificially randomized (maroon bars), wheresynteny blocks are defined as maximal collections of ortholog pairs where pairs of adjacent orthologouspairs have no more than 40 non-participating genes intervening between them.
Figure S7.2: HMM segmentation exampleEach graph plots the rank order of human genes along four human chromosome arms (horizontalcoordinate) versus the rank position of the B. floridae mutual-best-hit ortholog within five clusters of B.floridae scaffolds.
Vertical red lines indicate the boundaries between human chromosome arms, andhorizontal red lines indicate boundaries between scaffold clusters.
Discontinuities in the distribution oforthologous gene positions within chromosome arms identified by a hidden Markov model are indicatedby the addition of vertical black lines on the right.
These discontinuities are most easily explained bychromosomal fusions or large-scale re-arrangements in the human lineage that are recent compared tothe time scale of gene order evolution.
Figure S7.3: Clustering method for constructing putative ancestral linkage groups (PALs)Blue dots mark the position in human chromosome segments (vertical coordinate) and the Nematostellascaffolds (horizontal coordinate) of a pair of orthologous genes.
Nematostella scaffolds and humanchromosome segments have been ordered by a hierarchical clustering procedure, and concatenatedtogether. Gene positions are in rank order rather than base pair coordinate, where only genesdescended from the set of 7,766 ancestral gene clusters have been numbered.
Descendants ofancestral eumetazoan clusters with more than 25 genes from the six representative animal genomeswere excluded from the analysis.
Horizontal and vertical lines divide clusters of human chromosomesegments and Nematostella scaffolds defined by having an average pairwise correlation coefficient oftheir distribution of hits to the other genome greater than 0.2.
The trees along the left and top of theplot are graphical representations of the average pairwise correlation scores among the hierarchicallyclustered human segments (left) and Nematostella scaffolds (top). Terminal branches are centeredFigure S7.4: Detail of Human chromosome 12 showing genes contributing to PAL A.Detail of main text figure 4c, showing the region flanking the HOX C gene cluster on humanChromosome 12.
Horizontal tick marks indicate positions of human genes descended from the set of7,766 inferred ancestral genes.
Genes with an ortholog in Nematostella on scaffolds 26, 61, 53, 46, 3and 5 are labeled and connected by a colored line to the position of the Nematostella ortholog (See Fig4c), except where the gene falls into an ancestral metazoan cluster for more than 25 genes fromhuman, frog, fish, fly, nematode and Nematostella (Section S4). These large genes families are morelikely to have members showing spurious conserved synteny, since they may have members in manyregions of the genome.
The genes of the HOX C cluster fall into such a large family, but have beenlabeled to show the position of the HOX cluster.
Supplemental Online Material for Putnam et al., 200720Captions for Supplemental TablesTable S1.1 Partial list of the merits of Nematostella as a model organism.Table S2.1 Summary of WGS librariesShotgun libraries are identified by their four-letter name, which is used as a prefix to the identifier of allreads from the library.
For each library, the table lists: the mean size of genomic DNA inserts in basepairs the number of sequencing reads attempted for each library the number of reads with at least100 bp of high-quality sequence after removal of vector and low-quality sequence, as describedpreviously[Dehal 2002] the number of reads which have a detected alignment to other reads in theshotgun data set (see discussion above) the number of reads which are placed in the contigs of theassembly and the mean read length, after trimming.
Column totals are shown in bold for selectedcolumns, and the fraction of reads lost to trimming, lack of alignment, and lack of placement in theassembly is shown as a percentage of the previous total.
Table S2.2: Summary of tandem repeat elements from raw WGS reads.Paired fosmid end reads were screened for highly abundant 16-mer DNA words appearing in both endsof fosmid clones, indicating their presence in the genome in large tandem arrays.
Identified 16-merswere assembled with JUGGERNAUT, and their abundance in the whole genome shotgun reads wasestimated by alignment to a sample of WGS reads from all libraries using BLAST (19).Table S2.3. Transposable elements in the sea anemone genome.Table S3.1: Summary of gene model statistics For Nematostella Filtered Models 1.0Table S3.2: Compared abundances of PFAM domains for selected domains.The number of proteins with PFAM (45) hits to 10 abundant PFAM domains, along with the abundancerank of that PFAM domain in each genome, is compared among five metazoan genomes, includingNematostella.Table S3.3: Preferentially retained PFAM domains within recent tandem expansions inNematostellaTandem gene expansions were identified based on 4DTv as described in the text.

Cell colors indicate Bonferroni-corrected p-value  0.01 (yellow),  0.05 (pink),  0.5(blue).Table S7.3: The 225 ancestral gene clusters linked with the HOX clusters in PAL-A: Table S7.3 is available as SOM 2 on the Science web site.
The table lists the inferred ancestraleumetazoan genes that show ancient conserved linkage with both the vertebrate HOX clusters andNematostella scaffolds 3 and 61.
Each row lists the internal ID number of the cluster, followed by thenumber of recognized descendant genes in each of the representative genomes used in the analysis,separated by commas: Human, Xenopus tropicalis, Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Nematostella the genes in each of these species, separated by a semi-colon, with alternative identifiers for the same gene separated by a forward slash.Table S8.1: Table of functional categories enriched for novel genes of the three types.Panther ontology annotations of the inferred ancestral gene set have been tested for enrichment ineach of the three categories of novelty (novel sequence, novel domain, and novel combination ofdomains), as described in section S8, and significant over- and under-representations have beentabulated here for (A) Panther Ontology Terms for Biological Process and Molecular Function, and (B)Panther Pathways.
For each term with a significant over or under representation, the table shows: theontology term ID from the Panther system the natural log of the p-value for the enrichment a + or - to indicate over- and under-representation, respectively the number of inferred ancestral geneswhich both have the annotation in question, and belong to the category of novelty being considered[N(ont & cat)] the number of inferred ancestral genes which have the annotation in question [N(ont)] the number of inferred ancestral genes belonging to the category of novelty being considered [N(cat)] the total number of inferred ancestral genes [N(total)  the percentage of novelties of the categorybeing considered which are annotated with the ontology term [N(ont & cat)/N(cat)]  the percentage ofall ancestral genes which are annotated with the ontology term [N(ont)  N(cat)] and a shortdescription of the ontology term.
