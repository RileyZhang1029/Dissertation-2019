12, 20882095 dec. 2009 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy The natural tropism of most viral vectors, including adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, leads to predominant transduction of neurons and epithelia within the central nervous system (CNS) and retina.
Despite the clinical relevance of glia for homeostasis in neural tissue, and as causal contributors in genetic disorders such as Alzheimers and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, efforts to develop more efficient gene delivery vectors for glia have met with limited success.
Recently, viral vector engineering involving high-throughput random diversification and selection has enabled the rapid creation of AAV vectors with valuable new gene delivery properties.
We have engineered novel AAV variants capable of efficient glia transduction by employing directed evolution with a panel of four distinct AAV libraries, including a new semirandom peptide replacement strategy.
These variants transduced both human and rat astrocytes in vitro up to 15-fold higher than their parent serotypes, and injection into the rat striatum yielded astrocyte transduction levels up to 16% of the total transduced cell population, despite the human astrocyte selection platform.
Furthermore, one variant exhibited a substantial shift in tropism toward Mller glia within the retina, further highlighting the general utility of these variants for efficient glia transduction in multiple species within the CNS and retina.
Received 4 March 2009; accepted 15 July 2009; published online 11 August 2009. doi:10.1038/mt.2009.184 IntroductIon Glia play a number of critical roles in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system, including providing structural and nutritional support for neurons, maintaining tissue homeostasis, and participating in signal transmission in neural tissue.1,2 Given these natural roles, glia are an attractive therapeutic target, particularly because many regions of the brain possess significantly more glia than neurons,3 and since it is unlikely that neurons severely afflicted by disease or injury are the optimal source of secreted neuroprotective factors.
Furthermore, dysfunction of astrocytes likely plays a significant role in the pathology of genetic diseases, including Alzheimers4 or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,5 and reactive astrogliosis has been implicated as detrimental for neuroregeneration.
Mller cells, the radial glial cells of vertebrate retina, react similarly to astrocytes in many ocular injuries, including retinal detachment and retinal neovascular disease.
To date, the use of viral vectors including adeno-associated virus (AAV) to transduce glia in vivo has met with limited success,69 even when combined with glial-specific promoters.10 AAV, a nonpathogenic virus in humans, is capable of robust systemic delivery11 and exhibits a strong clinical safety profile.1214 Therefore, we sought to engineer an AAV variant for highly efficient gene delivery to glia.
AAVs single-stranded DNA genome has two open reading frames, including cap, which encodes for the structural proteins VP1-3 that assemble into the icosahedral viral capsid.15 AAV vectors based on the capsids of the natural variants16 mediate efficient gene delivery in a range of tissues.7,11,17 However, within the brain and retina, natural AAV variants predominantly exhibit neuronal tropism,7,9,1820 potentially due to inefficient uptake by astrocytes.21 Some level of astrocyte transduction in vivo has been reported for AAV4 and AAV5,7,8,18,22 though AAV4 transduces astrocytes only within the subventricular zone, and reports of AAV5 transduction of astrocytes have been highly variable, potentially due to differences in vector production and promoter usage.19,23 Recently, AAV9 has been shown to transduce astrocytes via intravenous injection, though expression was observed in other tissues including heart and muscle.24 Engineering the AAV capsid for targeted delivery based on the rational insertion of defined peptide sequences into the capsid has enjoyed some success.2528 As a complementary approach, we recently reported that directed evolution can successfully create AAV vectors with novel gene delivery properties,29 and this approach has since been extended to generate highly chimeric AAV variants by family shuffling.3033 Here, we successfully merged numerous AAV library strategies to engineer novel AAV vectors for CNS and retinal gene therapy.

12 dec. 2009 2089 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Evolved AAV Variants With Enhanced Glial Tropism followed by selection on primary human astrocytes.
In addition to enhanced properties in vitro, several resulting variants efficiently transduced astrocytes at levels up to 5.5-fold greater than the parental serotypes in the rat striatum, and one vector additionally exhibited enhanced tropism for Mller cells in the retina.
These novel vectors further demonstrate the utility of directed evolution for creating novel viruses and may enhance gene therapies for the treatment of numerous neurological disorders.
results Barriers in AAV gene delivery to astrocytes We first determined the relative gene delivery efficiencies of seven AAV serotypes (1, 2, 46, 8, and 9) on primary human astrocytes (Figure 1).
Iodixanol-purified, high-titer recombinant AAV (rAAV) cytomegalovirus (CMV) green fluorescent protein (GFP) vectors30 were generated, and we found that the transduction efficiencies of the serotypes varied considerably, over a 500-fold range, with the following order: AAV2 > 1 = 6 = 9 > 5 > 4 > 8.
Because high genomic multiplicity of infections (>104) were required to transduce >50% of the astrocytes even for the more efficient natural serotypes, and because all AAV variants are reportedly inefficient on glia in vivo,7,9,1820 we next probed potentially limiting steps in AAV gene delivery to human astrocytes.
We first quantified the relative-binding ability of several viral serotypes to astrocytes (Figure 1).
Intriguingly, the trend in viral binding (AAV2 > 4 > 6 > 1 = 5 = 9 > 8) closely matched that of viral transduction, except that AAV4 which bound almost as well as AAV2, was extremely poor in transducing astrocytes.
The low transduction efficiency observed for AAV4 is thus due to a later step in viral infection, such as internalization or inefficient unpackaging.34 Interestingly, treatment of astrocytes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the genotoxic agent hydroxyurea which reportedly overcome barriers in vector degradation and genome processing in some systems such as lung epithelium35 resulted in only modest (<1.5-fold) increases in GFP+ cells for all serotypes (data not shown).
The data indicate that vector engineering may be required to achieve efficient transduction of astrocytes because even serotypes that bind efficiently to astrocytes (AAV2 and 4) fail to achieve high levels of gene delivery (Figure 1).
library construction We conducted directed evolution of the AAV capsid to enhance astrocyte gene delivery using a panel of highly diverse (>107) viral libraries: an AAV2 random mutagenesis library (AAV2-EP),29 a chimeric AAV library (ShH),30 and an AAV2 peptide display library (AAV2 7mer).27,28 In addition, we generated new AAV2based libraries via a bioinformatics-based surface loop replacement strategy.
Previously, peptide-based AAV2 capsid engineering studies have predominantly manipulated the surface loop containing the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)binding site (i.e., ~585RGNR~);2528 however, recent studies of the AAV2 capsid have highlighted several other regions that significantly influence the transduction properties of AAV2.30,31,36 Therefore, we chose to engineer four important surface loops37 (Table 1 and Figure 2).
We replaced the wild-type (wt) AAV2 sequence with a semirandom sequence determined by bioinformatics analysis of 130 AAV cap genes obtained from the GenBank database.38 These loops include L1 (~262SQSGASN~, purple in Figure 2b), L2 (~446SRTNTPSGTTTQSR~, blue in Figure 2b), L3 (~545QGSEKTNVDIEK~, red in Figure 2b), and L4 (~585RGNRQAATADVNT~, green in Figure 2b).
Specifically, the VP1 protein sequences were aligned to identify positions within these loops highly conserved either in amino acid identity or in chemical properties (e.g., charge, polarity, hydrophobicity, etc.).
For each loop, residues that were conserved in >90% of sequences were fixed, whereas amino acids whose identity was limited to one of several residues in >90% of the sequences were encoded with a restricted codon (e.g., RGC for serine and glycine).
Finally, all other residues were replaced with a random amino acid, encoded by an NNK codon.
The resulting semi-random sequences (Table 1) were introduced into the AAV2 cap gene using spliced AAV1 AAV2 AAV4 AAV5 AAV6 AAV8 AAV9 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 N or m al iz ed fr ac tio n bo un d 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Infectivity Binding T U :v g ra tio x 1 04 Figure 1 characterization of natural AAV serotypes.

This library, which builds upon work conducted with the HSPG-binding site,2528 is the first to explore and exploit the modular nature of numerous additional surface loops and to engineer highly diverse libraries guided by bioinformatic analysis of many (>100) serotypes.
selection and in vitro characterization of successful viral variants One round of evolution consisted of initial library diversification followed by four or five selection steps.
An in vitro selection approach with primary astrocytes from the adult human cerebral cortex was implemented.
Briefly, 5 105 primary human astrocytes were infected with iodixanol-purified, replication-competent AAV libraries29,30 at a genomic multiplicity of infection of 103, and successful virions were amplified by the later addition of wt adenovirus type 5 to complete one round of selection.
After five rounds of selection, preliminary characterization of individual rAAV CMV-GFP generated with capsid clones from the AAV2 EP, AAV2 7mer, and chimeric AAV libraries failed to reveal variants with enhanced gene delivery (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figure S1, and data not shown).
Therefore, the cap genes from the AAV2 libraries (EP and 7mer) and the chimeric AAV library were pooled and further diversified using DNA shuffling and random mutagenesis.
The resulting library was then subjected to four additional selection steps.
Subsequent analysis of the mutants selected in this second round of evolution revealed several clones related to AAV2 and/or AAV6 that exhibited enhanced transduction of primary human astrocytes (two-to fivefold higher than wtAAV2 and tenfold higher than wtAAV6) (Figure 3a, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).
ShH13 was closely related to AAV6, whereas the others were based on AAV2 (Supplementary Figure S2).
Some variants (ShH7, ShH14, ShH21, and 2H22) differ from the parent serotype by up to five mutations, whereas several variants (ShH13, ShH18, ShH19, and ShH22) are viral chimeras with capsid regions from several serotypes swapped into either AAV2 (ShH18, ShH19, and ShH22) or AAV6 (ShH13) scaffolds.
Interestingly, no variants from the AAV2 7mer were found after the second evolutionary cycle.
Clones isolated after a single round of evolution with the loop replacement libraries contained new L1, L2, or L3 regions and were more efficient on astrocytes (2-to 15-fold) relative to wtAAV2 (Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure S3, and Table 1).
Furthermore, most of these new functional loops possessed very low sequence similarity to wtAAV2, demonstrating that these regions of the AAV2 capsid are highly modular.
Intriguingly, some variants (L2-17, L3-6, L4-7, L4-9, and L4-23) exhibited considerable reductions in viral infectivity (more than tenfold), potentially due to the loss of important complementary interactions between some residues within these loops and structurally adjacent regions of the capsid.
To characterize the gene delivery properties of the selected variants further, we analyzed their relative transduction efficiencies on SHSY-5Y (a human neuroblastoma cell line).
Interestingly, efficiencies for most of the viral variants were significantly less (two-to fivefold) than that of wtAAV2 (Figure 3b), perhaps implying potential astrocytic selectivity compared to AAV2s a 1 TAA Region encoding surface loop Design motif 2 3 4 Round 2 PCR Round 1 PCR and DpnI treatment Semi-random sequence motif b Figure 2 design of novel loop replacement library.

12 dec. 2009 2091 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Evolved AAV Variants With Enhanced Glial Tropism strong neuronal tropism.7,21 Gene delivery efficiencies of these novel variants varied on other glial cells, including rat astrocytes (where ShH19 exhibited highest transduction levels) and U87MG glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Figure S4).
Importantly, all of the AAV2-based variants exhibited HSPG dependencies similar to wtAAV2, except for two (L1-12 and L3-7) that were more dependent on HSPG than wtAAV2 (Supplementary Figure S5).
Therefore, the enhanced transduction efficiencies of these AAV2like mutants are likely due to improvements in either secondary receptor interactions or later stages of viral infection.
In vivo gene delivery of selected viral mutants To further demonstrate the potential of these novel variants for in vivo gene delivery to astrocytes, we generated double-stranded (ds) AAV vectors expressing GFP under the control of the hybrid CAG (CMV early enhancer/chicken-actin) promoter, which has been shown to mediate more robust gene expression within the CNS, and in particular within astrocytes, than the CMV promoter.10,18,19 Capsids from the most efficient human astrocyte variant (L1-12), the most efficient rat astrocyte variant (ShH19, Supplementary Figure S4), the AAV6-like variant (ShH13), and the corresponding control parent serotypes AAV2 and AAV6 were analyzed.
Hightiter rAAV dsCAG-GFP vectors were purified via the same method (iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation followed by heparin affinity chromatography), to avoid differences in vector purity that have been implicated in altering astrocyte transduction in vivo.19 A volume of 3 l DNase-resistant genomic particles (5 108 vg) were stereotactically injected into striatum of female rats, and all AAV variants and control serotypes exhibited robust GFP expression AAV2 AAV6 ShH13ShH19 L1-12 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% AAV2 AAV6 ShH13 ShH19 L1-12 P er ce nt c el ls G F P +/G F A P + * ** Figure 4 enhanced in vivo astrocyte tropism of evolved AAV variants.

12 dec. 2009 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Evolved AAV Variants With Enhanced Glial Tropism 3 weeks after injection (Figure 4).
For all variants and serotypes, >99.5% of the GFP+ cells were either NeuN+ or GFAP+, with minimal transduction of other cell types, such as microglia (data not shown).
Similar to previous reports utilizing the CAG promoter,18,23 wtAAV2 transduced astrocytes infrequently (2.7 1.8%), whereas wtAAV6 mediated somewhat higher gene delivery to astrocytes (8.4 1.6%).
ShH13 transduction of astrocytes was not significantly higher than wtAAV6.
In contrast, the AAV2-like variants ShH19 and L1-12 transduced 5.5-fold (14.9 3.0%) and 3.3-fold (9.0 3.0%) greater numbers of astrocytes, respectively, compared to wtAAV2.
Furthermore, these enhanced transduction levels may further increase when utilized in a human, as the selections were performed with primary human cells.
To explore further the utility of these variants in glia in vivo, we injected recombinant variants into the subretinal space in rat eyes to observe their efficiency in infecting a glial subtype within the retina, Mller cells.
Three weeks after injection, observation of GFP expression revealed that ShH13 exhibited the most pronounced shift in tropism toward glia, with expression localized predominantly to Mller cells and retinal pigment epithelium, while its parent vector AAV6 showed much lower GFP expression and primarily within photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (Figure 5).
dIscussIon Glia are a potentially important therapeutic target within the CNS and retina, either to counteract disease pathology directly involving these cells or to harness them to secrete therapeutic proteins and thereby protect neighboring neurons from injury or disease.
Most current AAV serotypes fail to efficiently transduce astrocytes or Mller glia in vivo, and even serotypes such as AAV4 and AAV5 that can infect astrocytes either transduce only a subset within a specific brain region (the subventricular zone for AAV4)8 or exhibit variable efficiencies (AAV5).7,18 Additionally, recent work in the retina utilizing AAV vectors that are more resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation resulted in greatly improved efficiencies, yet still relatively low gene delivery to Mller glia.20 Accordingly, we have employed directed evolution to engineer a novel AAV vector capable of efficient gene delivery to astrocytes and potentially other glia cells.
Furthermore, while the selections were performed on human cell in vitro, the resulting variants exhibited enhanced infection of astrocytes upon injection into the rat striatum (ShH19 and L1-12) (Figure 4) or Mller glia within the rat retina (ShH13) (Figure 5), making them attractive candidates for future studies in disease models.
These results suggest that directed evolution coupled with stringent selections can engineer novel capsid variants that can effectively transduce related cells across multiple species.
Barriers to efficient AAV gene deliverysuch as poor binding, proteasome degradation, and genome processingvary greatly among cell types.25,27,28,35 Our results indicate that while efficient cell binding is likely one such barrier present within astrocytes, downstream barriers may also play a significant role as evidenced by the binding results for AAV4 (Figure 1) and the improved efficiencies of numerous AAV2-and AAV6-based variants with similar HSPG dependencies as their parents (Supplementary Figure S5).
Of particular note, a previous study using fluorescently labeled AAV2 failed to detect any significant viral uptake in astrocytes,21 reflecting poor internalization of AAV2, potentially due to inefficient interactions with secondary protein receptors that facilitate receptor-mediated endocytosis.36 Importantly, while a lack of detailed mechanistic knowledge of specific gene delivery barriers in this and other cases can preclude rational design strategies to improve vector properties, a broader black box approach to engineer efficient AAV vectors through random diversification and high-throughput selection can still succeed.
Recent efforts in AAV capsid engineering30,31,39 have suggested that certain loop regions may be highly modular and may therefore enable functional loop swapping methods among various serotypes.
Based on these observations, we developed a new semirandom loop replacement strategy for the engineering of novel vectors.
Strikingly, after four rounds of selection, many of these variants, which contained new loop sequences of up to 14 amino acids in length, demonstrated enhanced levels of gene delivery (Figure 3a).
For example, replacement of loop 2 (L1, ~262SQSGASN~) of wtAAV2 (shown in purple in Figure 2b) with an octamer sequence, analogous to the size of wtAAV6, yielded clones with improved gene delivery efficiencies on a panel of cell types (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S4 and S5).
This loopwhose length in natural serotypes varies from four (AAV4, AAV11, and AAV12) to eight (AAV1, AAV5, AAV6, and AAV9) amino acids modulates the tropism of AAV vector, potentially via interactions with secondary protein receptors.30,36 Our loop-engineering strategy focused on identifying residues that are conserved among the serotypes.
However, it does not detect amino acid positions that may have coevolved with other positions within a given serotype, due for example to physical contact between a loop and another region in the tertiary or quaternary structure of the capsid, but whose identity may not be strictly conserved from serotype to serotype.
For instance, this approach initially considered amino acid 553 within L3 as random; however, all six selected clones retained the aspartic acid of wtAAV2 at this location.
Within the AAV2 capsid structure,37 D553 (within L3) forms an ionic interaction with R459 (within L2), which may help stabilize these two capsid loops and ensure proper capsid assembly.
Similar analysis of the selected L2 sequences revealed the retention of a hydrogen bond acceptor (serine) or basic residue (arginine) at the randomized amino acid position 447 (R for wtAAV2), which interacts with both E499 and N551.
Future refinement in this approach may incorporate information regarding key structural contacts37,40,41 to aid the engineering of novel AAV vectors with customized gene delivery properties.
Analysis of the novel AAV2 and AAV6 variants yields several interesting insights.
Within the AAV2-like clones, mutations N496H, located at the apex of the threefold axis of symmetry, and Q598L, located within the crater at the threefold axis, may play a role in the enhanced transduction (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).
These sites may thus represent new targets for vector engineering.
Interestingly, none of the mutations in the AAV6-based mutant ShH13 is predicted to be surface-exposed, and these changes may thus indirectly alter receptor binding via modulating the surface structure of the viral capsid, or alter later infection steps such as intracellular trafficking or vector unpackaging.
For example, one such interior mutation (F129L) lies within the VP1-unique region but does not overlap with previously identified functional domains Molecular Therapy vol.

12 dec. 2009 2093 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Evolved AAV Variants With Enhanced Glial Tropism within VP1.42 In a recent directed evolution study, we demonstrated that changes within this region can significantly enhance the gene delivery properties of the evolved variant, potentially due to changes in endosomal escape of the virus.33 Finally, the most efficient AAV variants in vivo (ShH19 and L1-12) acquired very similar loop 2 sequences (SQDTQASN and SASTGASN for L1-12 and ShH19, respectively, compared to SQSGASN for wtAAV2, shown in purple in Figure 2b) through distinct methods (i.e., shuffling for ShH19 and loop replacement for L1-12).30,36 Together, these results highlight how exploring complementary yet distinct libraries can reveal key common features (i.e., capsid regions) that may be exploited in future directed evolution experiments.30 The ability of ShH13 to transduce two glia cell types, astrocytes and Mller cells, suggests a common mechanism for the improved gene delivery.
Mller glia possess apical-basal polarity, and many astrocytes also retain some features of this polarity.43 In epithelial cells, cell polarity has previously been shown to result in inefficient trafficking of AAV to the nucleus,35 and an analogous nonproductive infection may occur within some glia.
ShH13, which contains only mutations on the interior of the capsid and within the VP1-unique region, may exhibit enhanced transport through the cytoplasm through altered PLA2 activity.
33,42 Alternatively, the variant could utilize a receptor more highly expressed in astrocytes and Mller cells relative to the surrounding neuronal cells, such as epidermal growth factor receptor or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3.44,45 In summary, by employing directed evolution with a diverse array of novel AAV libraries including a new peptide loop replacement library, we engineered novel AAV vectors capable of highly efficient delivery to astrocytes in vitro and importantly to astrocytes and Mller glia in vivo.
These AAV capsids in conjunction with cell-specific promoters, such as GFAP, and other recently identified capsid mutations20 may yield further enhancements in the targeted gene delivery to astrocytes and Mller glia to treat a variety of genetic diseases.
For example, modulating mutant superoxide dismutase-1 expression within astrocytes may reduce neuronal cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,5 or therapeutic gene delivery may prevent the accumulation of amyloid-plaques in Alzheimers disease.4 Furthermore, because Mller cells span the entire retina and surround every class of neuron present within this tissue, transduction of Mller cells would permit spread of neurotrophic factors throughout all layers of this tissue to significantly augment existing therapies for retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration and neovascularization.1214,46 These novel capsids may thus endow AAV vectors with the capacity to treat a variety of neurodegenerative disorders in disease models and ultimately in the clinic.
MAterIAls And MetHods Cell lines and viral production.
Cell lines were cultured at 37 C and 5% CO2, and unless otherwise mentioned were obtained from the American type culture collection (Manassas, VA).
Primary human astrocytes from the cerebral cortex (ScienCell, San Diego, CA) were cultured according to the manufacturers instructions.
AAV293 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), rat astrocytes (primary cells derived from adult rat brain), and the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium.
SHSY-5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line, was cultured in minimum essential medium, alpha modification (MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO).
All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Library generation and viral production.
Random mutagenesis libraries were generated by subjecting cap genes from AAV2 to error-prone PCR using CAP For and CAP Rev as forward and reverse primers, respectively, as previously described.29 All primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table S2.
Peptide display libraries were generated similar to previous reports.27,28 Briefly, a unique AvrII was introduced into pSub2Cap2 between amino acid 587 and 588 by PCR mutagenesis.
A random 21 nucleotide insert, 7mer For, was used to synthesize dsDNA inserts, along with the antisense primer 7mer Rev.
The resulting dsDNA inserts were cloned into the AvrII site of pSub2Cap2 after digestion with NheI.
A previously generated AAV library constructed by DNA shuffling of cap genes from AAV1, 2, 46, 8, and 9 was also used.30 The novel random loop replacement libraries were constructed as follows (Figure 2).
First, sequences of 130 AAV cap genes were obtained from the GenBank database38 and aligned with BioEdit (www.mbio.ncsu.
edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html).
Positions within each wtAAV2 loop (Table 1) were then analyzed for several characteristics: amino acid identity, charge, polarity, and hydrophobicity.
Any feature contained within >90% of the sequences was then encoded into the new AAV2 loop sequence using defined or restricted codons.
All other positions were then replaced by a random codon (NNK).
Next, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a stop codon (TAA) into each of the loops of interest within the AAV2 cap gene to generate four template plasmids and prevent carryover of wtAAV2 sequences into the final viral library.
Spliced overlap extension was performed using two partial cap products: P1, which contains fully wtAAV2 sequence (using flanking forward and loop reverse primers), and P2, which contains a wtAAV2 anchor sequence to anneal with the 3-end of P1 followed by the semi-randomized loop sequence and the remainder of the wtAAV2 sequence (using loop forward and flanking reverse primers).
The resulting products were gel purified, and various molar ratios were used as templates for a second PCR using the flanking primers.
Primers used for the mutagenesis are provided in Supplementary Table S2.
Finally, the resulting cap genes were cloned into pSub2 for replication competent AAV production.29 The rcAAV libraries and rAAV vectors expressing GFP under a CMV promoter were packaged as previously described.29,30 DNase-resistant genomic titers were obtained via quantitative PCR, and transduction titers were obtained by flow cytometry.29,30 Library selection and evolution.
Primary human astrocytes (5 105) were infected with each viral library at a genomic multiplicity of infection of 103.
Twelve hours after infection, the media were changed, and cells were infected with wt adenovirus to amplify successful AAV variants.
Fortyeight hours later, cells were harvested and lysed to yield the viral pool for the next selection round.
After four such rounds of selection, successful cap genes were recovered by PCR.
The resulting pool of cap genes was subjected to DNA shuffling and EP PCR to generate a new library for the next selection rounds.29,30 In total, the AAV2 EP/7mer library and chimeric AAV library were subjected to two evolutionary cycles (i.e., mutagenesis plus selection steps), and the random loop libraries were subjected to one evolutionary cycle.
In vitro transduction and cell-binding analysis.
Transduction studies using rAAV CMV-GFP were performed with 5 104 cells (primary human astrocytes, rat astrocytes, U87MG, CHO, pgsD, and SHSY-5Y) in 12-well plates.
Cells were transduced with rAAV GFP vectors at a genomic multiplicity of infection of 103105 (n = 3), and the percentage of GFP-expressing cells was determined by flow cytometry 48 hours after infection.
Viralbinding assays were performed as previously described.33 In vivo characterization.
ds rAAV vectors expressing GFP under a CAG promotercomposed of the CMV enhancer, chicken-actin promoter, and rabbit-globin intron10were packaged with capsids from AAV2, AAV6, ShH13, ShH19, and L1-12 and purified using iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation followed by heparin column purification as previously 2094 www.moleculartherapy.org vol.

12 dec. 2009 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Evolved AAV Variants With Enhanced Glial Tropism described.29 rAAV vectors were stereotaxically injected into the striatum of the rat brain (AP, +0.2; ML, 3.5; DV, 4.5 from skull) of adult female Fischer 344 rats (100 g, 6 weeks).
The animals were anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg animal) and xylazine (10 mg/kg animal) prior to injection, and 3 l of high-titer AAV vectors (5 108 vg/l) were injected using Hamilton syringe as described.47 After 3 weeks, animals (n = 4 per vector) were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and the retrieved brains were postfixed by immersing in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 C, with subsequently stored in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection before sectioning.
Coronal sections (40 m) were cut using a freezing, sliding microtome.
Cell phenotype was identified by the primary antibodies mouse-anti NeuN (1:200; Chemicon, Billerica, MA) and guinea pig-anti GFAP (1:1,000; Advanced ImmunoChemical, Long Beach, CA), and GFP expression was amplified using primary rabbit anti-GFP (1:2,000; Invitrogen).
Corresponding secondary antibodies (labeled with AlexaFluor 488, 546, and 633) were used for detection.
For nucleus staining, some sections were counterstained using TO-PRO-3 (1:2,000; Invitrogen).
Animal protocols were approved by the UCB Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.
rAAV6 and ShH13 were also injected subretinally into adult wt Sprague Dawley rats.
Before vector administration, rats were anesthetized with ketamine (72 mg/kg) and xylazine (64 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.
An ultrafine 30-gauge disposable needle was inserted through the sclera to create an entryway for a Hamilton syringe for subsequent injection of 3 l of high-titer AAV vector (1 1012 vg/ml) between the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor layer.
Three weeks after vector injection, the eyes were enucleated, a hole was made in the cornea, and eyes were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 23 hours.
The cornea and lens were removed, and the resulting eyecups were stored in 30% sucrose overnight.
Eyes were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature embedding compound (OCT; Miles Diagnostics, Elkhart, IN) and oriented for making 510-m thick transverse retinal sections using a freezing, sliding microtome.
Mller glia were visualized using the primary antibody rabbit anti-glutamine synthetase (1:2,500; Sigma, St Louis, MO), and the corresponding Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was used for detection.
All procedures were handled according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals and approved by the UCB Animal Care and Use Committee.
