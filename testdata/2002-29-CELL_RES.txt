v12_n2_143-150.p65 Cell Research (2002); 12(2):143-150Recombinant scorpion insectotoxin AaIT kills specifically insect cells but not human cells SHENG JIAN JI, FENG LIU, ER QIU LI, YU XIAN ZHU* The National Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Plant Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China ABSTRACT The nucleotide sequence deduced from the amino acid sequence of the scorpion insectotoxin AaIT was chemically synthesized and was expressed in Escherichia coli.
The authenticity of this in vitro expressed peptide was confirmed by N-terminal peptide sequencing.
Two groups of bioassays, artificial diet incorpo ration assay and contact insecticidal effect assay, were carried out separately to verify the toxicity of this recombinant toxin.
At the end of a 24 h experimental period, more than 60% of the testing diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae were killed in both groups with LC50 value of 18.4 M and 0.70 M respectively.
Cytotoxicity assay using cultured Sf9 insect cells and MCF-7 human cells demonstrated that the toxin AaIT had specific toxicity against insect cells but not human cells.
Only 0.13 M recombinant toxin was needed to kill 50% of cultured insect cells while as much as 1.3 M toxin had absolutely no effect on human cells.
Insect cells produced obvious intrusions from their plasma membrane before broken up.
We infer that toxin AaIT bind to a putative sodium channel in these insect cells and open the channel persistently, which would result in Na+ influx and finally cause destruction of insect cells.
Key words: Scorpion toxin, AaIT, prokaryotic expression, cytotoxicity.

The effective components of the venom are a group of proteins composed of 30-80 amino acids which possess neurotoxicity[1].
Ion channels are the main targets for various neurotoxins[2].
The scorpion tox ins can be classified mainly into two major catego ries according to their sizes and pharmacological tar get sites: the short-chain toxins composed of 31-37 amino acids and bridged by three or four disulfide bonds that affect mainly K+ channels, and the long chain toxins composed of 60-70 amino acids and bridged by four disulfide bonds that affect mainly Na+ channels[3-5].
The long-chain insect toxins can be further subdivided into two groups: the depres sant toxins and the excitatory toxins[6].
The former induces a progressive flaccid paralysis of insects by blocking the action potentials[7], and is represented by BmK IT4, Aa IT5, Ba IT2, Bot IT4 and Bot IT5, Bj IT2, Lqh IT2, and Lqq IT2[1], [8-13].
The later causes an immediate spastic paralysis of insects by inducing repetitive firing in the motor nerves[14], and is represented by AaIT, Bj IT1, Bjxtr IT, Lqq IT1, Amm IT, Lqh IT1 [12],[13], [15-17].
The insect toxin AaIT (Androctonus australis Hector Insect Toxin) is produced by the highly toxic scorpion Androctonus australis Hector and is among the first toxins purifieded from scorpion venom.
AaIT is an excitatory long-chain toxin specific to insects and is composed of 70 amino acids with four disul fide bridges[18],[19].
The specificity of AaIT to in sects was revealed both at the organism level and 144 the tissue level[20].
Here we carried out in vitro cell toxicity assay to explore the selectivity of AaIT to cultured insect cells.
In vitro cell toxicity assay is commonly used in toxicity assessment since it is not only simple, sensitive, economical and homogeneous, but also it has ethical advantages for it is animal free[21].
In the current work, we evaluated the tox icity of bacterially expressed AaIT to diamondback moth larvae as well as to cultured cell lines.
We verify that the prokaryotically expressed toxin has appar ent specific toxicity only to insect cells, but not to human cells.

E.coli strain DH5a and HB101 were used for plasmid construction, propaga tion and prokaryotic expression.
MCF-7 human breast-tumor cells were stored in our laboratory and Sf9 insect cells (from Spodoptera frugiperda ovary) were kindly given to us by Professor Meihao Hu at our university.
The temperature-induced, non-fusion ex pression vector pBV220, which contains PRPL promoter, was kindly given to us by Professor Zhiqing Zhang[22].
Insect larvae were purchased from Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing were commercially done by GIBCO BRL (USA) and Shanghai BioAsia Company (China) respectively.
Peptide N-terminal sequencing was carried out by our laboratory.
Synthesis of the full-length AaIT coding sequence, construction of cloning vector and prokaryotic expression vector We designed and synthesized four partially complementary oligonucleotides (A1, A2, A3 and A4) according to the nucleotide sequence reported previously[19](Fig 1A), and obtained the entire AaIT coding sequence through annealing and filling (Fig 1B and Fig 1C).
Full-length AaIT coding sequence was cloned into pBluescript II SK to produce the vector pBS-AaIT.
The identity of the synthetic gene was verified by DNA sequencing and the cod ing sequence was then cloned into expression vector pBV220.
The authenticity of the constructed expression vector pBV220/AaIT was confirmed by DNA sequencing again.
Large-scale expression and purification of recombi nant AaIT protein About 5-6 g of frozen DH5a cell pellets expressing the AaIT toxin were resuspended in 30 ml TN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1 M MgCl2) with 35 g/ml DNase I added.
The lysate was sonicated thoroughly.
The inclusion bodies were pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml TN buffer.
The pellets were washed and resuspended in denaturing buffer [5.6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) dissolved in degassed sterile H2O] by gentle agitation for 6-16 h at 4oC.
The solubilized protein was rapidly diluted 1:25 into degassed refolding buffer [final concentrations: 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1m M EDTA, 40 mM DTT, 1mM ZnCl2, 280 mM guanidine hydrochloride, 500 mM L-arginine, 2 mM glu tathione (GSH), 1 mM glutathione disulfide (GSSG)] and allowed to refold for 24 h at 4oC[23].
The sample was concentrated and desalted by ultrafiltration with a 1K Mini-Ultrasette system (Pall Gelman, USA).
Insoluble debris and misfolded proteins were then removed by centrifugation (8000 g, 15 min) and the supernatant was loaded onto Sephacryl S-100 HR resin pre-equilibrated with 0.01M NH4HCO3.
The toxin was eluted with the same buffer.
Fractions were collected and lyophilized to dryness.
The recombi nant toxin was separated by electrophoresis through a 15% poly acrylamide gel and stained by Coomassie Blue.
N-terminal peptide sequencing of recombinant toxin AaIT The purified recombinant toxin AaIT was loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred from the gel to PVDF membrane in a CAPS buffer system (100 mM CAPS, 10% methanol, pH11).
The membrane was stained for 3 min in Coomassie Blue R-250 solution (1% Coomassie Blue R-250, 50% methanol, 1% acetic acid) and then destained in 50% methanol till the protein band appeared.
Peptide sequencing was carried out on Applied Biosystem 491 Protein Sequencer.
Bioassays of prokaryotically expressed toxin AaIT The recombinant toxin AaIT was dissolved in distilled water and then diluted consecutively to produce 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, and 40 mM toxin solutions.
Insect bioassays were carried out using early third instar diamondback moth larvae.
Artificial diet incorporation assay.
Fresh cabbage leaves were first treated with absorbent cotton to remove the wax present on the surface before being cut into leaf disks (F 1.5cm) and soaked into the toxin solutions for 10 seconds.
The leaf disks were then air-dried and fed to the diamondback moth larvae in culture dishes (5 leaf disks per 10 larvae).
The assay on each concentration point was repeated for 4 times.
The dishes were placed in the light incu bator (25 1oC, 16L:8D) for 24 h. Dead larvae were counted at the end of 24 h experimental period.
Contact insecticidal effect assay.
The larvae were soaked in various toxin solutions for 5 seconds and were then placed on filter paper to absorb the extra moisture.
The treated larvae were placed in the culture dishes and fed with fresh cabbage leaves.
The assay on each concentration point was carried out with 10 larvae Toxicity studies of recombinant AalT 145 and was repeated for 3 times.
Dead larvae were counted at the end of 24 h experimental period.
Construction of the standard curve for cell number Various numbers of Sf9 insect cells and MCF-7 human cells (1104, 2104, 4104, 6104, 8104, 10104, 12104, 14104, 16104, 18104, 20104 cells) were added to the wells of a 96-well plate, followed by adding the medium (TNM-FH medium for Sf9 cells and RPMI 1640 medium for MCF-7 cells, both containing 10% FBS) to give the final volume of 100 l. The cultures were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h before 20 l/well of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent was added.
After 1 h incubation (Sf9 cells at 27 in a normal atmosphere, and MCF-7 cells at 37 in a 5% CO2 atmosphere), the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).
The standard curve for cell number was drawn with cell number per well on X axis and absor bance at 490nm on Y axis.
Cytotoxicity assays of recombinant toxin AaIT to Sf9 insect cells and to MCF-7 human cells 1 104 Sf9 and MCF-7 cells were added to the wells of a 96 well plate seperately.
The wells contained 100 l either TNM-FH growth media or RPMI 1640 growth media with 0, 0.00026, 0.00052, 0.
0026, 0.013, 0.026, 0.13, 0.26 or 1.3 M toxin added.
The plates were incubated for 48 h before 20 l of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent was added to each well.
After 1-4 h of further incubation, the absorbance at 490nm was recorded using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
The cytotoxicity assay for each of the two cell lines was done in triplicates.
RESULTS Expression of recombinant AaIT in E.coli Upon induction by transferring the culture from 30oC to 42oC, a protein of ~ 7 kDa identical to the deduced molecular weight of the toxin was expressed in E.coli strains harboring the plasmid pBV220/ AaIT (Fig 2, lanes 2-5).
The expression reached its maximum level after 8 h high temperature treatment with no more apparent increase in 10 h (Fig 2, lanes 4-5).
Purification and sequence identification of the recombinant toxin AaIT Preliminary experiments showed that most of the toxin produced in E.coli was localized in inclusion bodies (data not shown).
The recombinant protein was purified via ultrafiltration followed by Sephacryl S-100 HR gel filtration and was finally lyophilized to dryness.
A small fraction of the powder was dis solved in distilled water and was loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel (Fig 2, lane 7).
Gel-purified re combinant toxin AaIT was subjected to automated protein sequence analysis.
The first eight cycles of an Edman degradation gave the sequence Met-Lys Lys-Asn-Gly-Tyr-Ala-Val, which was identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from nucleotide se quence (Fig 1C).
Though the recombinant toxin starts with an additional Met residue compared with the native toxin, it is unlikely to affect the function of AaIT because it is N-terminal.

Bioassays using prokaryotically expressed toxin AaIT Very different toxicities were observed as the result of two different bioassays.
In the artificial diet incorporation assay, no larvae were killed by feed ing leaves treated with solutions containing less than 0.2 M toxin (Tab 1).
By contrast, in contact insec ticidal effect assay, we observed significant amount of dead larvae with as low as 0.02 M toxin (Tab 2).
The median lethal concentration (LC50) of the two assays was 18.40 M and 0.70 M, respectively.
Cytotoxicity assays of recombinant toxin AaIT to Sf9 insect cells and to MCF-7 human cells We first constructed a standard curve to show that there was a linear response between cell num ber and absorbance at 490nm (Fig 3, inset).
The background absorbance shown at 0 cell/well was subtracted from each data point.
In the cytotoxicity assay, the cell number in each well was calculated by the absorbance at 490 nm according to the stan dard curve.
The mortality curve was drawn with toxin concentrations on X axis and cell mortality on Y axis.
About 50% of insect cells were killed in a toxin concentration of 0.13 M in 48 h, and all MCF 7 human cell survived even in a toxin concentration as high as 1.3 M (Fig 3), which demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of the toxin to human cells must have been extremely low.
We also observed a change in the morphology of insect cells after 48 h toxin treatment.
At the begin ning of the experiment, both insect and human cells were spherical (Fig 4A, D).
However, when toxin was included in the growth media, many insect cells produced obvious intrusions from their plasma mem brane as shown in the inset of Fig 4B.
These cells broke up into pieces very rapidly with longer incu bation time or with increasing toxin concentrations in the media (Fig 4A, B, C).
Human cells did not produce any obvious intrusions throughout the whole experiment (Fig 4D, E, F).
DISCUSSION We constructed originally an efficient system for the expression of a scorpion toxin AaIT coding se quence in E.coli and carried out three different bio assays to study the toxicity of this recombinant Fig 3.

Interestingly, the median lethal concentra tion (LC50) for the three assays differed by more than two orders of magnitude (Tab 1 and 2, Fig 3).
Com paring with an LC50 of 0.13 M observed in cultured insect cells and an LC50 of 0.7M observed in the contact insecticidal effect assay, low toxicity with an LC50 of 18.4 M was recorded in artificial diet incor poration assay in which the toxin was consumed by the testing insect through feeding.
We suggested that this might be a result of toxin degradation by digestion.
This raised an important question regard ing agricultural application of the toxin.
According to our calculation, 18.4 M toxin spread on the leaf surface equaled to 0.04% toxin protein expressed in the leaves (suppose total leaf protein content is 3.
0%).
This was comparable to the level previously ob Fig 4.

Cells were all magnified100 except in the insets which were 500.
Toxicity studies of recombinant AalT 149 tained in insect resistant transgenic plants which was about 0.05-0.1%[24-26].
Even with a toxin as potent as AaIT, high level expression was still im perative for transgenic plants to show decent insect resistance.
In the cytotoxicity assay, the toxin showed higher toxicity with an LC50 of 0.13 M, which was comparable to the cytotoxicity of Wt-hTNFa to the HEp-2 cells[27].
Due to the limitation in the amount of toxin that could be added to the media, we could not obtain an LC50 for cultured human cells (Fig 3).
However, it was intriguing to see that 1.3 M toxin had abso lutely no effect on the morphology of these human cells while more than 80% of the cultured insect cells were torn and collapsed in media containing the same amount of toxin (Fig 4).
The intrusions from the intoxicated insect cells we observed were simi lar to the blebbing of the plasma membrane observed from wasp venom toxicity studies[28].
Cohen et al [29] argued that the disruption of the plasma mem brane might be due to other components present in their raw venom preparations.
However, here we verified that the purified recombinant AaIT toxin was able to disrupt the cell membranes before kill ing the cells.
Since AaIT showed high affinity for the sodium channel in insect neuronal membranes and no affinity at all for the same site in the mam malian neuronal membranes[20], we suggest that AaIT toxin bind specifically to the sodium channel of the cultured insect cells in the similar manner.
The binding of the toxin would result in a persis tent opening of the sodium channel and the follow ing Na+ influx would cause cell blebbing and collapse due to oncosis.
The finding that wasp venom in creased plasma membrane permeability to Na+, re sulting in cellular swelling and death due to oncosis [28],[30], supported our suggestion.
In vitro cultured insect and human cell lines may be used to study resistance development and in systemic toxicity evaluation as well.
