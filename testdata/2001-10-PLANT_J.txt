Summary Arabidopsis copper chaperone (CCH) belongs to a family of eukaryotic proteins that participates in intracellular copper homeostasis by delivering this metal to the secretory pathway.
In this work we show that the CCH protein is mainly located along the vascular bundles of senescing leaves and petioles, as shown by tissue prints and immunohistochemical detection.
CCH protein also accumulates in stem sieve elements and is collected in phloem exudates.
Accordingly, Arabidopsis CCH is the only member of the metallochaperone family described to function intercellularly to date.
Moreover, the CCH protein remains stable when plants are subjected to excess copper that causes a rapid and specic decrease in its mRNA.
These facts point to a role for CCH in copper mobilization from decaying organs towards reproductive structures, as a result of metalloprotein breakdown.

Introduction Intracellular free copper levels must be tightly regulated through homeostatic networks to ensure proper function of key metalloproteins while avoiding toxic excess.
Complementation studies performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that similar copper homeostatic path ways operate in all eukaryotes (for reviews see Koch et al., 1997; Pen a et al., 1999).
In plants, copper homeostasis has been brought to centre stage (Himelblau and Amasino, 2000) since ethylene perception has been shown to require the proper ow of copper through the secretory pathway (Hirayama et al., 1999).
One of the copper network components in Arabidopsis thaliana is the copper chaperone CCH, a member of an emerging family of proteins that binds copper ion within the cytosol and delivers it to the appropriate subcellular destinations (for review, see Harrison et al., 2000).
CCH is the homologue of S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic copper chaperone Antioxidant 1 (Atx1), that delivers Cu(I) to Ccc2, a P-type ATPase that pumps the metal ion into the lumen of a post-Golgi compartment (Lin et al., 1997).
The Arabidopsis Ccc2 homologue, RAN1, is involved in ethylene signalling by transporting copper to the secretory pathway (Hirayama et al., 1999; Woeste and Kieber, 2000), where it is required for the creation of functional ethylene receptors (Rodriguez et al., 1999).
By analogy with the homeostatic model from yeast, CCH could be involved in directing Cu(I) to RAN1.
Thus, ethylene receptors and other secreted copper-binding proteins (e.g.extracellular multi copper oxidases) might also depend on the CCH/RAN1 copper route to acquire the copper cofactor.
In spite of the fact that these data indicate a role for CCH in the homeostatic regulation of copper within plant cells, little is known about the function that this protein might have in the physiology and development of plants.
Dealing with this, it has been recently demonstrated that CCH mRNA is up-regulated during natural and ozone-acceler ated leaf senescence (Himelblau et al., 1998; Miller et al., 1999), although the role of the copper chaperone during these processes is unclear.
Leaf senescence is characterized by an orderly loss of structures and metabolic functions collectively referred to as the senescence syndrome, a progression of changes that ultimately lead to cell death (Bleecker, 1998; Nooden and Guiamet, 1996; Weaver et al., 1997).
Leaf senescence involves degradation of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, and mobilization of the resulting nutrients to other parts of the plant, where the vascular The Plant Journal (2001) 25(5), 521528 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd 521 system plays a pivotal role in the translocation of resources, therefore contributing to growth of developing organs.
In this paper, we analyse some of the exclusive features that the Arabidopsis copper chaperone CCH presents in comparison to its homologues from all other organisms studied, with the aim of gaining clues regarding the role of copper chaperones in plants.
Special attention has been paid to the location and protein stability of this plant metallochaperone and its implication in senescence.
Results CCH accumulation and distribution during senescence A plant-specic characteristic of copper homeostasis is the increase in the mRNA levels during senescence of several described homeostatic components such as CCH (Himelblau et al., 1998) and RAN1 (Himelblau and Amasino, 2000).
We studied CCH protein accumulation during natural leaf senescence in Arabidopsis by Western blot analysis.
Leaves at different stages of development were chosen from the rosette by visual estimation, taking into consideration the percentage of yellow leaf surface.
In mature green, 25%, 50% and 100% yellow senescing leaves, both mRNA and protein followed the same accu mulation pattern: progressively rising from mature green to 50% yellow leaves and decreasing thereafter (Figure 1a,b).
In order to examine the spatial distribution of the CCH protein within the leaf, tissue prints of senescing rosette leaves at the above indicated stages were per formed.
Figure 1(c) shows that CCH protein is mainly restricted to the midrib vascular vein (class I vein) and to the petiole of 50% yellow senescing leaves.
A parallel experiment where Rubisco antibodies were used to develop leaf tissue prints, as a control for non-specic protein release, did not show any preferential Rubisco distribution in the midrib vein (result not shown).
Tissue location of CCH protein In order to further address the question of cellular location of the CCH protein during leaf ageing, immunohisto chemical detection of CCH was carried out in transverse sections of mature green and 50% yellow leaves.
Preimmune serum used as a control virtually gave no signal both in green (Figure 2a) and in senescing (not shown) leaf sections.
Immunohistochemical labelling was mainly detected in the class I and class II phloem veins from both green leaves (Figure 2b) and the green portion of 50% yellow leaves (Figure 2c), although the signal dramatically increased in senescing leaves.
After a closer examination of the vascular bundles of green leaves where CCH is mainly located, we observed CCH protein accumulation in specic phloem cells (Figure 2e), whereas other cell types displayed undetectable labell ing (comparable to the preimmune control, Figure 2d).
In contrast, CCH accumulated at high levels all over the phloem of senescing leaves (Figure 2f).
In addition, immunoreactivity was also observed in phloem-associated parenchyma cells and in the apoplast regions surrounding phloem and xylem elements (arrows in Figure 2f).
Transverse sections of green (Figure 2g) and senescing (Figure 2h) petioles displayed a similar CCH distribution pattern.
In order to check phloem tissues other than leaf and petiole, protein location studies were also undertaken in stem transverse (Figure 3a,c,d) and longitudinal sections (Figure 3e).
After immunodetection, samples were stained with DAPI for nuclei (Figure 3b,c,d,f) and with water blue for callose detection (results not shown).
The use of both stains helped to discriminate between phloem companion cells and sieve elements, revealing that accumulation of the CCH protein occurs in stem sieve elements but not in their associated companion cells.
Presence of the CCH protein in phloem exudates CCH protein location along the phloem was further assessed by Western blot analysis of leaf phloem exudates Figure 1.

While the CCH protein almost disappeared in the leaf after 48 h, it became detectable in the exudate, most likely due to unloading of the phloem sap (Figure 4).
In order to check if extensive protein degradation is taking place in leaves under our experimental conditions, or if exudates are contaminated by non-phloem proteins, the same samples were also analysed using a Rubisco antiserum.
The Rubisco signal was detected in detached leaves before and after incub ation, but was not detected in their exudates (Figure 4).
Effects of metal treatment on CCH expression and protein stability Another fact that differentiates the Arabidopsis metallo chaperone CCH is that its mRNA is down-regulated by copper treatment (Himelblau et al., 1998), whereas homo logues in other organisms are not susceptible to copper status, but rather subjected to iron-regulated gene expres sion (Lin et al., 1997).
With the aim of checking whether the CCH mRNA decay in plants is specically regulated by copper ions, the mRNA was quantied by Northern blot analysis after 30 min treatment of whole plants with different metals such as copper, iron, zinc and cadmium.
As shown in Figure 5(a), only copper treatment induced a decrease in CCH mRNA.
Since copper levels have been shown to diminish during senescence in Arabidopsis (Himelblau and Amasino, 2000) and to further address if protein location is related to copper status in the plant, Arabidopsis excised leaves were treated with copper or with the copper chelator BCS.
The effectiveness of the treatments was assessed by measur ing the enzymatic activity of the copper-binding protein ascorbate oxidase.
When compared to the control, ascorb ate oxidase activity increased and decreased after copper and BCS treatments, respectively (Figure 5b).
Northern and Western blots revealed that, under conditions where CCH mRNA levels were undetectable and expression of copper detoxifying systems such as metallothionein MT1a was induced, the amount of CCH protein remained unaltered in Arabidopsis leaves (Figure 5c).
Discussion The CCH gene appears to be in a single copy in the Arabidopsis genome based on a database search.
The CCH protein is ubiquitously detected by Western blot through out all the plant organs analysed (results not shown), which is in accordance with the gene transcription prole (Himelblau et al., 1998).
The protein is also detected in leaf protoplasts mainly obtained from mesophyll cells (results not shown), in agreement with the intracellular house keeping function associated with metallochaperones Figure 2.

In this sense, the apparent absence of signal in mesophyll cells, shown in Figures 2 and 3, can be explained by the staining conditions used for micro scopy experiments that emphasize the high abundance of CCH protein in sieve elements of green leaves and stems, but do not allow detection of low levels of protein present in other cells from the same sample.
Based on the CCH transcript and protein levels observed during senescence (Figure 1a,b), CCH can be classied as a senescence-associated gene (SAG), a group of diverse genes that are mainly involved in salvage functions (Gan and Amasino, 1997).
However, since total protein decays during senescence (Brady, 1988; Lohman et al., 1994), the increase in relative abundance of the CCH protein could simply reect the maintenance of its levels during this period.
Nevertheless, considering results obtained from tissue print experiments, it seems the concentration of CCH protein indeed rises during senescence on a per leaf area basis and in leaf vascular bundles (Figure 1c), suggesting a role in nutrient transport.
Our results show that the CCH protein belongs to the pool of soluble polypeptides found in phloem sap, as it is detected by Western blot analysis of Arabidopsis phloem exudates (Figure 4), which further indicates that CCH could partici pate in long-distance copper transport in vascular plants.

524 Helena Mira et al.Blackwell Science Ltd, The Plant Journal, (2001), 25, 521528 During sieve element differentiation, cells undergo a selective degradation of internal structures.
As a result, sieve elements of owering plants loose their capacity for transcription, translation and protein maturation, and depend upon associated companion cells for much of their metabolic functions (Oparka and Turgeon, 1999; Thompson and Schulz, 1999).
Thus, like other proteins found in sieve elements, CCH must be synthesized in companion cells and imported to the sieve elements through plasmodesmata connecting both cell types, and once inside the sieve tube, the protein would ow from source to sink organs in an osmotically driven trans location stream (Fischer et al., 1992).
Therefore, our results demonstrate that CCH crosses the sieve element/com panion cell interface.
Because in organisms other than plants copper chaperones have been ascribed to function exclusively inside the cells, this CCH intercellular trafck ing between companion cells and sieve elements repre sents a differential feature of plant chaperones.
It is therefore tempting to speculate that the exclusive CCH protein C-terminal domain of unknown function (Himelblau et al., 1998) could be involved in this transport.
It has been described that plants recycle metal ions from senescing leaves to the growing organs (Drossopoulos et al., 1994; Drossopoulos et al., 1996; Hocking, 1994; Mauk and Nooden, 1992).
Organic compounds such as nicotian amine and metal-binding proteins have been implicated in the phloem-mediated copper redistribution, at least in certain species (Garca-Hernandez et al., 1998; Miller et al., 1999; Schmidke and Stephan, 1995; Stephan and Scholtz, 1993).
In this sense, the Arabidopsis MT1a gene is highly expressed in tissues involved in nutrient transport and its mRNA has been located to the vascular bundle (Garca Hernandez et al., 1998).
However, metallothioneins such as MT1a presumably act as chelators that both bind copper in a nonexchangeable form and are up-regulated by copper once toxic metal concentrations are achieved inside the cell (Zhou and Goldsbrough, 1994).
On the contrary, CCH expression is specically repressed by copper (Figure 5) and the CCH protein has the ability to bind and deliver copper to a specic target, at least when produced in yeast (Himelblau et al., 1998), thus indicating that MT1a and CCH function might be different.
It is possible that the high levels of CCH in the phloem are necessary to compete with other molecules for copper and to guarantee its delivery to the secretory pathway, mediating the loading of extra cellular copper-requiring proteins en route from senescing tissues to developing organs.
Moreover, due to the antioxidant role demonstrated for other non-plant CCH homologues (Lin and Culotta, 1995; Portnoy et al., 1999) and for CCH in yeast (Mira and Pen arrubia, unpublished results) a nonexcluding possibility is that CCH may participate in the protection of the vascular system from oxidant toxic molecules produced during senescence, Figure 5.

Arabidopsis copper chaperone functions intercellularly 525 Blackwell Science Ltd, The Plant Journal, (2001), 25, 521528 preventing the damage of these structures and keeping them functional for the proper and organized dismantling of other cells in a senescing organ.
We have found that CCH mRNA is specically down regulated by copper when compared to treatments with other metals (Figure 5a).
After severe copper exposure of detached leaves to 1 mM copper solutions, used by other authors to check the molecular effects of copper on plants (Mehta et al., 1992), whereas CCH mRNA levels are undetectable and MT1a expression is already induced, CCH protein levels remain constant (Figure 5b).
CCH mRNA instability in Arabidopsis under copper treatment suggests that its product is not required in the presence of excess copper.
However, the protein is stable under these conditions that usually induce degradation of other proteins such as Rubisco (Mehta et al., 1992).
CCH protein stability under copper-induced oxidative stress could be based on its amino acid composition.
Cysteine residues have been proposed as the main targets of protein oxidative-induced turnover (Moreno et al., 1995; Stadtman, 1990).
In CCH, there are only two Cysteine residues and they are likely to be involved in copper binding (Himelblau et al., 1998).
This probably blocks the sensitivity of the protein to environmental redox condi tions.
Thus, these apparently contradictory effects of copper on CCH mRNA and protein levels could simply reect differences in stability of both molecules under oxidative stress caused by copper excess and probably indicate that under these conditions the CCH protein present in cells is enough to perform its function.
These results add new aspects to the discussion on the role played by CCH during senescence.
First, the stability of CCH protein under enhanced oxidative conditions, which also characterize senescence, would agree with CCH operating during this physiological process.
Moreover, as senescence progresses, different leaf cells would suffer from copper excess or defect, depending on the path and kinetics that metal follows to exit these organs.
In this sense, the role of CCH remains still unsolved, since CCH could participate either when copper is abundant (as discussed above) or, on the other hand, CCH could function by delivering copper, when scarce, once the bulk of copper has left the organ, to cells that have to be functional in order to guarantee a thorough leaf dismantling.
Although further experimental support would be necessary to explore this possibility, the decrease in CCH mRNA levels under copper excess (Figure 5) seems to point to a preponderant role of CCH under copper defect.
Briey, our results indicate a specic cell-to-cell role of metallochaperones in plants and the implication of CCH in phloem-mediated copper reallocation during senescence associated nutrient salvage.
Experimental procedures Plant growth conditions Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia (Col 0), were grown in pots and covered with a clear plastic dome.
The covered pots were placed in a cold room at 4C for 2 days to synchronize germination, and then moved to a growth cabinet at 23C with a 16 h photoperiod (65 mmol m2 of cool-white uorescent light).
Plants were harvested after indicated times.
Metal and BCS treatments For metal and bathocuproinedisulphonic acid (BCS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) treatments, either plants or rosette leaves from 4-to 5-week-old Arabidopsis were excised and then immediately submerged in 1 mM copper, iron, zinc or cadmium sulphates or 1 mM BCS solutions for 30 min or 18 h. Exudate collection To obtain phloem exudates, rosette leaves from 4-to 5-week-old Arabidopsis were excised and their petioles immediately submerged in 5 mM EDTA solution for 48 h, and placed in a moist chamber as described elsewhere (Weibull et al., 1990).
Protein extraction, gel electrophoresis, Western blot analysis, tissue prints and ascorbate oxidase determinations Plant tissue was extracted using 2 volumes of extraction buffer [50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM PMSF, 2 g l1 leupeptin, aprotinin].
After 1 min of vortexing followed by centrifugation twice at 5000 g for 10 min, the total protein in the supernatants was determined by Lowry's method following the protocol of Ausubel et al.(1995).
Ten mg of total protein were separated using reducing 14% SDSPAGE.
Gels were either stained with Coomassie blue or electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for immunodetection with antiserum against CCH recombinant protein (H. Mira and L. Pen arrubia, unpublished results) or against Rubisco from Euglena gracilis (Garca-Ferris and Moreno, 1994).
Detection of antigen-antibody complexes was performed using the ECL System (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Tissue prints were performed on nitrocellulose membranes and developed as Western immunoblots.
Ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) activity was measured on total protein extracts from Arabidopsis leaves utilizing the protocol from Diallinas et al.(1997).
RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis tissues as described by Prescott and Martin (1987).
RNA was quantied by UV spectrophotometry and its integrity was visually assessed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels.
For RNA blots, 5 mg of total RNA were separated by denaturing-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane as described by Sambrook et al.(1989).
RNA blots were hybridized overnight at 65C with [a-32P]dATP-labelled cDNA probes which were previously puried in a Sephadex G-10 spin column (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, 526 Helena Mira et al.Blackwell Science Ltd, The Plant Journal, (2001), 25, 521528 Sweden).
After washing, the lters were analysed using a radioanalytical imaging system (InstantImager 2024, Packard, Canberra, Australia) or were exposed to X-ray lms at 80C using an intensifying screen.
Immunohistochemistry Arabidopsis leaves, petioles and stems were sectioned and incubated overnight in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with paraformaldehide 4% (w/v).
Samples were rinsed thoroughly in the same buffer, dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared in xylene and embedded in low temperature-melting paraplast wax (Sigma).
Ten-micron transverse or longitudinal sections of leaves, petioles and stems, obtained with a rotating microtome, were mounted onto slides using TESPA (Sigma) as the adhesive medium.
After de-waxing and hydrating the slides, the avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) indirect immunoperoxidase detection of CCH was performed.
Where indicated, nuclear DNA was stained with 3 mg ml1 4-6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI, Sigma) or with 0.01% aniline blue prepared in 67 mM K2HPO4, pH 12 buffer.
Prior to the immunohistochemical protocol, endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by bathing the sections in 2% H2O2 prepared in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (TBS) for 30 min at room temperature.
Samples were incubated overnight at 4C in a moist chamber with primary antibody (1 : 2000 dilution) followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h with 1 : 200 diluted biotinylated IgG goat antirabbit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Immunodetection was carried out with the avidin/biotin ABC (Vector Labs) system.
The resulting peroxidase label was histochemically developed with 0.025% (w/v) 3,3diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) and 0.01% H2O2 for 2030 min at room temperature.
Finally, slides were dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared with xylene and coverslipped using Permount (Fisher Scientic, NJ, USA).
For comparison, all samples were treated in parallel with the same solutions and reagents and controls with preimmune serum were performed in consecutive sections.
