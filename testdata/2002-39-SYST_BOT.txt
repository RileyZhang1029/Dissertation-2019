A previous analysis of two chloroplast gene regions, rbcL and the rps16 intron, showed a clear phylogenetic pattern in Gunnera. However, these regions were not informative enough to completely resolve the phylogeny.
In this study the nuclear ITS region was sequenced for 24 specimens representing 22 species of Gunnera. 223 characters out of 819 were informative and supported the same monophyletic groups as the chloroplast gene regions.
Because of its greater information content, the ITS region identiﬁed additional well-supported clades. In an analysis based on the three gene regions together, 272 characters out of 3154 were informative.
The results show that the South American annual, G. herteri is sister to all other species.
The African G. perpensa is well-supported as sister to the remaining species, which form two well-deﬁned clades, one with the Malayan G. macrophylla as sister to subgenus Milligania from New Zealand and Tasmania. In the other clade, the South American subgenus Misandra is sister group to subgenus Panke from South America and Hawaii. Within Panke the two Hawaiian species form a sister group to the American species.
The morphological classiﬁcation of Schindler, together with some biogeographical and morphological features, is discussed.
The systematically isolated genus Gunnera, with 30 40 species in Central and South America, Africa, Mad- agascar, Tasmania, New Zealand, Hawaii, and the Ma- layan Archipelago (Bader 1961), has long intrigued botanists.
It has usually been included in the Halora- gaceae in the Myrtales, but the systematic position has remained doubtful, and the genus is sometimes placed in a family of its own.
Even though the disjunct south- ern distribution and its unique relationship with en- dosymbiotic cyanobacteria continued to attract atten- tion, it was not until recently that the isolated position of Gunnera in the tricolpate clade was recognized (Chase et al. 1993). The only monograph of the genus was published by Schindler in 1905.
He divided Gunnera into ﬁve sub- genera, Perpensum, Pseudogunnera, Panke, Misandra, and Milligania, mainly based on size, means of vegetative propagation, and geographic distribution.
Schindler s subgenus Perpensum only includes the African G. per- pensa, which is the type species for the genus (Linnae- us 1767). For nomenclatural reasons (Greuter et al. 2000), the subgenus name Perpensum should therefore be replaced with Gunnera. The species from New Zea- land and the single Australian species G. cordifolia were included in subgenus Milligania. Subgenus Misandra includes only two species, G. lobata and G. magellanica, restricted to the southern part of South America. To subgenus Panke belong all the huge South and Central American species of Gunnera as well as the two Ha- waiian species.
Subgenus Pseudogunnera includes only the Malayan G. macrophylla. Schindler s classiﬁcation was completed in 1933 by the addition of a new sub- genus, Ostenigunnera (Mattfeld 1933), in connection with the discovery of the new, morphologically dis- tinct, species G. herteri, among the sand dunes of the Atlantic coast in Uruguay. That G. herteri is an annual species, the only in the genus, was noted only recently (Wanntorp et al. 2001). In 1995, some preliminary results on the phylogeny of Gunnera based on morphological and anatomical characters were summarized in an abstract by Fuller.
In 2001, Wanntorp et al. published a phylogenetic study of Gunnera based on sequences from the chlo- roplast genome (Fig. 1). It was found that the South American Gunnera herteri is sister to all other species.
Gunnera perpensa from Africa was weakly supported as sister group to the remaining species, which in turn formed two, well-supported clades. One included the Malayan G. macrophylla, the single Australian species G. cordifolia and the species from New Zealand. The second clade comprised the South American and Ha- waiian species.
The rbcL and rps16 intron regions used in that study gave only 49 informative characters, which was not enough to completely resolve the phylogeny.
The po- sition of the African G. perpensa remained doubtful.
The relationship was still unresolved between G. ma- gellanica and the Panke group in the South American species as was much of the relationship within the Ma- layan-Australasian clade (Fig. 1). A better resolved phylogeny of Gunnera will aid in studying its disjunct distribution as well as in under- standing the evolution of characters such as means of propagation and those traits connected with the sym- biosis with the cyanobacteria (Wanntorp in prep.). The aim of the present study is to further investi- gate the phylogeny of Gunnera by including several more species and by studying another gene region, the 512  2002] WANNTORP ET AL. : GUNNERA PHYLOGENY 513 FIG.1.

A small African genus of shrubby plants, Myrothamnus, is well supported as sister group and the only close relative of Gunnera in recent molecular studies based on rbcL, atpB and 18S (Hoot et al. 1999 Soltis et al. 2000). Myrothamnus includes two species, M. ﬂabellifolius from parts of Africa and M. moschatus endemic to Madagascar (Endress 1989). Of these two species, only M. ﬂabellifolius has been sequenced so far.
This species was also used as outgroup in the previous rbcL/rps16 intron study of Gun- nera (Wanntorp et al. 2001). Myrothamnus could unfortunately not be used as outgroup in the present study because the primers used for the ampliﬁcation of the ITS region in Gunnera did not work for M. ﬂabellifolius. The lack of adequate primers led us to try universal primers that produced DNA of low yield.
Multiple copies of ITS were also detected.
The rbcL/rps16 intron analysis identiﬁed G. herteri as sister group to all the other included species of Gunnera (Wanntorp et al. 2001). The support for this placement was very high, so G. herteri was used as outgroup in the present ITS anal- ysis. In the analysis combining rbcL, rps16 intron, and ITS sequenc- es, M. ﬂabellifolius was used as outgroup and its missing ITS se- quence was replaced by questions marks.
Ingroup Sampling.
The intention of this study was to include as many species as possible of Gunnera. Sequences of 24 specimens representing 22 different species of Gunnera (Table 1) were includ- ed in the combined analysis.
Twelve species belonging to subge- nus Panke were sampled to cover as much of geographic distri- bution as possible.
Unfortunately, Panke is still under-represented from Colombia, where many endemic species occur (Mora-Osejo 1984). Gunnera chilensis was collected in mainland Chile G. peltata, G. bracteata, and G. masafuerae were collected in the Juan Ferna ndez Islands, and the ITS sequences from the latter two species were kindly provided by Dr. E. Ruiz (Universidad de Concepcio n, Chile). Material of G. brasiliensis collected in the Serra do Mar in southeastern Brazil as well as a cultivated specimen of G. manicata were included in the present study.
In the previous molecular study of Wanntorp et al. (2001), the rbcL sequence of G. manicata was retrieved from GenBank but the rps16 intron for this species was not sequenced due to the lack of material from the same source.
In this study, a cultivated specimen of G. manicata not stud- ied previously was sequenced.
Although we are working with dif- ferent specimens for the rbcL and ITS sequences, we treat these cultivated specimens as representing the same taxon in the com- bined analysis.
Subgenus Panke is also represented by G. boliviana, G. pilosa, G. talamancana, and G. insignis collected in Bolivia, Equa- dor, Costa Rica, and Panama, respectively.
From Hawaii, G. peta- loidea was collected on Maui and G. kauaiensis on Kauai. Gunnera perpensa has sometimes been considered to consist of a complex of different species or varieties (Schindler 1905 Skottsberg 1936). For this reason two specimens, one collected in Tanzania, the other in South Africa, were included.
Gunnera macrophylla from subgenus Pseudogunnera, sometimes regarded as a complex species (van der Post 1855) was represented by two different specimens from Su- matra and Java, respectively.
The previous discovery of structur- ally different sequences of rbcL in these specimens (Wanntorp et al. 2001) was another reason for including both in the present anal- ysis. Subgenus Misandra from South America was represented by G. magellanica and G. lobata, both collected in Chile. From subgenus Milligania, four species from New Zealand were included (G. den- tata, G. hamiltonii, G. monoica, and G. prorepens), together with G. cordifolia from Tasmania. Lastly, Gunnera herteri collected in Uru- guay was added to the ingroup in the rbcL/rps16 intron/ITS anal- ysis. DNA Extraction, Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing.
Extracts were made from living plants or from silica-gel dried leaf fragments collected in the ﬁeld. DNA extractions, PCR ampliﬁcation, and se- quencing were conducted following Wanntorp et al. 2001.
The primers (18SF and 26SR) used for ampliﬁcation and sequencing of Gunnera were situated at the 3 -end of 18S and the 5 -end of the 26S, respectively (the primer sequences were obtained from C. Ry-  514 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 27 a c i o n o m.
