O. Box 50007, SE-107 05 Stockholm, Sweden 3Author for correspondence: (livia.wanntorp@botan.su.se) Communicating Editor: Paul Wilson ABSTRACT. A previous analysis of two chloroplast gene regions, rbcL and the rps16 intron, showed a clear phylogenetic pattern in Gunnera. However, these regions were not informative enough to completely resolve the phylogeny. In this study the nuclear ITS region was sequenced for 24 specimens representing 22 species of Gunnera. 223 characters out of 819 were informative and supported the same monophyletic groups as the chloroplast gene regions. Because of its greater information content, the ITS region identified additional well-supported clades. In an analysis based on the three gene regions together, 272 characters out of 3154 were informative. The results show that the South American annual, G. herteri is sister to all other species. The African G. perpensa is well-supported as sister to the remaining species, which form two well-defined clades, one with the Malayan G. macrophylla as sister to subgenus Milligania from New Zealand and Tasmania. In the other clade, the South American subgenus Misandra is sister group to subgenus Panke from South America and Hawaii. Within Panke the two Hawaiian species form a sister group to the American species. The morphological classification of Schindler, together with some biogeographical and morphological features, is discussed. The systematically isolated genus Gunnera, with 30 40 species in Central and South America, Africa, Mad-agascar, Tasmania, New Zealand, Hawaii, and the Ma-layan Archipelago (Bader 1961), has long intrigued botanists. It has usually been included in the Halora-gaceae in the Myrtales, but the systematic position has remained doubtful, and the genus is sometimes placed in a family of its own. Even though the disjunct south-ern distribution and its unique relationship with en-dosymbiotic cyanobacteria continued to attract atten-tion, it was not until recently that the isolated position of Gunnera in the tricolpate clade was recognized (Chase et al. 1993). The only monograph of the genus was published by Schindler in 1905. He divided Gunnera into five sub-genera, Perpensum, Pseudogunnera, Panke, Misandra, and Milligania, mainly based on size, means of vegetative propagation, and geographic distribution. Schindler’s subgenus Perpensum only includes the African G. per-pensa, which is the type species for the genus (Linnae-us 1767). For nomenclatural reasons (Greuter et al. 2000), the subgenus name Perpensum should therefore be replaced with Gunnera. The species from New Zea-land and the single Australian species G. cordifolia were included in subgenus Milligania. Subgenus Misandra includes only two species, G. lobata and G. magellanica, restricted to the southern part of South America. To subgenus Panke belong all the huge South and Central American species of Gunnera as well as the two Ha-waiian species. Subgenus Pseudogunnera includes only the Malayan G. macrophylla. Schindler’s classification was completed in 1933 by the addition of a new sub-genus, Ostenigunnera (Mattfeld 1933), in connection with the discovery of the new, morphologically dis-tinct, species G. herteri, among the sand dunes of the Atlantic coast in Uruguay. That G. herteri is an annual species, the only in the genus, was noted only recently (Wanntorp et al. 2001). In 1995, some preliminary results on the phylogeny of Gunnera based on morphological and anatomical characters were summarized in an abstract by Fuller. In 2001, Wanntorp et al. published a phylogenetic study of Gunnera based on sequences from the chlo-roplast genome (Fig.1). It was found that the South American Gunnera herteri is sister to all other species. Gunnera perpensa from Africa was weakly supported as sister group to the remaining species, which in turn formed two, well-supported clades. One included the Malayan G. macrophylla, the single Australian species G. cordifolia and the species from New Zealand. The second clade comprised the South American and Ha-waiian species. The rbcL and rps16 intron regions used in that study gave only 49 informative characters, which was not enough to completely resolve the phylogeny. The po-sition of the African G. perpensa remained doubtful. The relationship was still unresolved between G. ma-gellanica and the Panke group in the South American species as was much of the relationship within the Ma-layan-Australasian clade (Fig.1). A better resolved phylogeny of Gunnera will aid in studying its disjunct distribution as well as in under-standing the evolution of characters such as means of propagation and those traits connected with the sym-biosis with the cyanobacteria (Wanntorp in prep.). The aim of the present study is to further investi-gate the phylogeny of Gunnera by including several more species and by studying another gene region, the 2002] 513WANNTORP ET AL.: GUNNERA PHYLOGENY FIG. 1.

A small African genus of shrubby plants, Myrothamnus, is well supported as sister group and the only close relative of Gunnera in recent molecular studies based on rbcL, atpB and 18S (Hoot et al. 1999; Soltis et al. 2000). Myrothamnus includes two species, M. flabellifolius from parts of Africa and M. moschatus endemic to Madagascar (Endress 1989). Of these two species, only M. flabellifolius has been sequenced so far. This species was also used as outgroup in the previous rbcL/rps16 intron study of Gun-nera (Wanntorp et al. 2001). Myrothamnus could unfortunately not be used as outgroup in the present study because the primers used for the amplification of the ITS region in Gunnera did not work for M. flabellifolius. The lack of adequate primers led us to try universal primers that produced DNA of low yield. Multiple copies of ITS were also detected. The rbcL/rps16 intron analysis identified G. herteri as sister group to all the other included species of Gunnera (Wanntorp et al. 2001). The support for this placement was very high, so G. herteri was used as outgroup in the present ITS anal-ysis. In the analysis combining rbcL, rps16 intron, and ITS sequenc-es, M. flabellifolius was used as outgroup and its missing ITS se-quence was replaced by questions marks. Ingroup Sampling. The intention of this study was to include as many species as possible of Gunnera. Sequences of 24 specimens representing 22 different species of Gunnera (Table 1) were includ-ed in the combined analysis. Twelve species belonging to subge-nus Panke were sampled to cover as much of geographic distri-bution as possible. Unfortunately, Panke is still under-represented from Colombia, where many endemic species occur (Mora-Osejo 1984). Gunnera chilensis was collected in mainland Chile; G. peltata, G. bracteata, and G. masafuerae were collected in the Juan Fernández Islands, and the ITS sequences from the latter two species were kindly provided by Dr. E. Ruiz (Universidad de Concepción, Chile). Material of G. brasiliensis collected in the Serra do Mar in southeastern Brazil as well as a cultivated specimen of G. manicata were included in the present study. In the previous molecular study of Wanntorp et al. (2001), the rbcL sequence of G. manicata was retrieved from GenBank but the rps16 intron for this species was not sequenced due to the lack of material from the same source. In this study, a cultivated specimen of G. manicata not stud-ied previously was sequenced. Although we are working with dif-ferent specimens for the rbcL and ITS sequences, we treat these cultivated specimens as representing the same taxon in the com-bined analysis. Subgenus Panke is also represented by G. boliviana, G. pilosa, G. talamancana, and G. insignis collected in Bolivia, Equa-dor, Costa Rica, and Panama, respectively. From Hawaii, G. peta-loidea was collected on Maui and G. kauaiensis on Kauai. Gunnera perpensa has sometimes been considered to consist of a complex of different species or varieties (Schindler 1905; Skottsberg 1936). For this reason two specimens, one collected in Tanzania, the other in South Africa, were included. Gunnera macrophylla from subgenus Pseudogunnera, sometimes regarded as a complex species (van der Post 1855) was represented by two different specimens from Su-matra and Java, respectively. The previous discovery of structur-ally different sequences of rbcL in these specimens (Wanntorp et al. 2001) was another reason for including both in the present anal-ysis. Subgenus Misandra from South America was represented by G. magellanica and G. lobata, both collected in Chile. From subgenus Milligania, four species from New Zealand were included (G. den-tata, G. hamiltonii, G. monoica, and G. prorepens), together with G. cordifolia from Tasmania. Lastly, Gunnera herteri collected in Uru-guay was added to the ingroup in the rbcL/rps16 intron/ITS anal-ysis. DNA Extraction, Amplification and Sequencing. Extracts were made from living plants or from silica-gel dried leaf fragments collected in the field. DNA extractions, PCR amplification, and se-quencing were conducted following Wanntorp et al. 2001. The primers (18SF and 26SR) used for amplification and sequencing of Gunnera were situated at the 39-end of 18S and the 59-end of the 26S, respectively (the primer sequences were obtained from C.

In ad-dition, the primers C26A (TTTCTTTTCCTCCGCT, designed by Dr. Youngbae Suh at Seoul National University, Korea) and 340F (GGCAACGGATATCTCGGCTCTCG, designed by L. Wanntorp) were used for sequencing. All sequences were assembled and ed-ited using the Staden package (Staden 1996) and GDE (Smith et al. 1994). The sequences have been deposited in GenBank. The Genbank accession numbers are given in Table 1. In the previous study of Wanntorp et al. (2001) the rbcL sequenc-es of G. monoica and G. macrophylla were shorter. It was suspected that the phylogenetic relationship between these two species was due to a retrieved pseudogene. Recently the rbcL gene of G. mon-oica was sequenced once again (Wardle et al. 2001), and this time a sequence of usual length was found. In the combined analysis of the three genes in the present study we felt more confident in using this rbcL sequence instead of the sequence used in the pre-vious molecular study. New in this analysis is also the rbcL se-quence of G. lobata (Wardle et al. 2001). Phylogenetic Analyses. A variety of parameters was explored in the alignment of the ITS sequences performed with the package ClustalX 1,8-PPC (Thomson et al. 1997). The final alignment was adjusted manually, so as to keep the number of the total muta-tional changes to a minimum (the aligned data matrix can be ob-tained from the first author upon request). Indels were included in the analyses and coded according to the principles suggested by Simmons and Ochoterena (2000). Substitutions and indels were given equal weight in all phylogenetic analyses. An analysis of the ITS region alone was performed using Gun-nera herteri as outgroup. A combined analysis based on rbcL, rps16 intron, and ITS was then performed using Myrothamnus flabellifol-ius as outgroup. For some of the species, sequences of all the three gene regions were not available (Table 1). Question marks were therefore used for these sequences. We chose to do this, rather than to prune all these sequences from the analysis, to get as much information as possible from our material. As a result, 37% of the total data set was scored as missing data, representing 16% of the informative data matrix. All phylogenies were inferred using the program PAUP* version 4.0b6 (Swofford 2001). Bootstrap analyses based on 1,000 repli-cates were performed to explore the robustness of the trees. The following options were used for all analyses: parsimony, branch and bound search, stepwise furthest addition sequence, collapse zero-length branches. Bremer support (1994) was calculated using the program Autodecay version 4.0.29 PPC (Eriksson 1998). RESULTS The ITS Analysis. The sequenced 22 nucleotides of the 18S region did not contain any informative char-acters, six informative characters were detected in the sequenced part of the 26S region (79 nucleotides), ITS1 and ITS2 contributed 105 and 92 informative charac-ters, respectively. The conserved 5.8 S subunit yielded four informative characters. A complication sometimes encountered working with the ITS region is the pres-ence of polymorphic copies of this region. This prob-lem was not encountered in Gunnera. The ITS analysis included 24 sequences representing 22 species. Using G. herteri as outgroup, 223 characters out of 819 were informative (including 16 informative indel characters). The strict consensus tree of 30 most parsimonious trees is shown in Fig.2 (tree length 5 452; CI 5 0.84; RI 5 0.94). The two specimens of G. perpensa group strongly to-gether (bootstrap value 100%; decay index 47) and form the sister group of all other species of the ingroup (bootstrap value 100%; decay index 16). These remain-ing species are divided into two very well-supported clades, one including the American and Hawaiian spe-cies (bootstrap value 100%; decay index 31), and an-other including the species from Malaya, New Zea-land, and Tasmania (bootstrap value 100%; decay in-dex 26). The South American/Hawaiian clade forms a trichotomy. One subclade is formed by the two species G. magellanica and G. lobata (bootstrap value 100%; de-cay index 8). The second subclade consists of the Ha-waiian species, G. petaloidea and G. kauaiensis (bootstrap value 100%; decay index 15). The third subclade con-sists of all American species of subgenus Panke (boot-strap value 99%; decay index 5). Within this subclade there is generally little resolution. Gunnera manicata and G. brasiliensis group strongly together (bootstrap value 98%; decay index 4), forming a poorly supported group with G. boliviana (bootstrap value 52%; decay index 1). This group is weakly supported as sister group to the remaining American species. Among them, the Chilean species form a weakly supported group (bootstrap value 51 %; decay index 1). This was in turn divided into two subclades: Gunnera chilensis groups strongly with G. masafuerae (bootstrap value 98%; decay index 4), G. peltata and G. bracteata are sister species (bootstrap value 69%; decay index 1). In the second main clade, the two specimens of the Malayan G. macrophylla form the sister group (boot-strap value 87%; decay index 2) to a subclade including all the species from New Zealand and Tasmania (boot-strap value 86%; decay index 4). Within this subclade G. monoica is sister taxon to the other species (bootstrap value 84%; decay index 3). Next, Gunnera hamiltonii is the well-supported (bootstrap value 96%; decay index 4) sister to a subclade formed by G. cordifolia, which is in turn sister to G. dentata and G. prorepens, the latter two forming a weakly supported group (bootstrap val-ue 62%; decay index 1). The Combined Analysis. In the combined analysis of rbcL, rps16 intron, and ITS, 272 of 3154 characters were informative. The strict consensus tree for the 15 most parsimonious trees recovered is shown in Fig.3 (tree length 5 722; CI 5 0.82; RI 5 0.92). As in the previous rbcL/rps16 intron analysis, G. herteri emerged as sister to all other Gunnera species with a very high support (bootstrap value 100%, decay index 8). Apart from some different support values, the general topol-ogy obtained by the ITS analysis was again retrieved in the combined analysis. The only significant change from the ITS topology is that subgenus Misandra (G. magellanica and G. lobata) now emerges as a poorly sup-ported sister group to a monophyletic Panke (bootstrap value 57%, decay index 1). The Hawaiian species (G. kauaiensis and G. petaloidea) are now the sister group of the American species of the subgenus (bootstrap value 99%, decay index 5). 516 [Volume 27SYSTEMATIC BOTANY FIG. 2.

J 5 Java, S 5 Sumatra, SA 5 South Africa, T 5 Tanzania DISCUSSION The present study has generally corroborated the re-sults obtained in the rbcL/rps16 intron study (Wann-torp et al. 2001). The considerably higher number of informative characters in the ITS region and the en-hanced number of taxa of this study led to the further resolution of the tree, and some of the previously sug-gested monophyletic groups received higher support. The well-supported position of Gunnera herteri as sister group to the remaining species, found by the chloro-plast data (Wanntorp et al. 2001), was not further in-vestigated in the present study (see Choice of Out-group). Here, Gunnera perpensa was found as sister to two main clades, one containing all species from New Zealand, Tasmania, and Malaya, the other formed by South American and Hawaiian representatives. Within the former clade there was good resolution. Within the South American/Hawaiian clade, the position of the Hawaiian species as sister to the American Panke was retrieved with considerable support. The phylogenetic relationships of the 22 species of Gunnera examined in the present study is discussed below in relation to the classification of Schindler. Some morphological and biogeographical issues are also introduced. Subgenus Ostenigunnera, the Annual Species. Gun-nera herteri was originally thought to be a perennial like all other Gunnera species (Mattfeld 1933). Its annual habit was first discovered in the field by the two first authors and this was corroborated through cultivation (Wanntorp et al. 2001). This species is placed at the base of the cladogram based on the chloroplast se-quences. Gunnera herteri is somewhat divergent from the rest of the species in its molecular sequences. Sev-eral of the traits in its habit are also unique, which would make G. herteri a poor standard for deducing ancestral morphological traits in Gunnera. Gunnera her-teri was also supported as sister to the other species of the genus in the morphological study of Fuller (1995). Subgenus Gunnera, the African Species. The ITS and the rps16 intron data suggested that G. perpensa is sister group to a clade consisting of all remaining spe-cies of Gunnera. The rbcL data, instead, placed G. per-pensa as sister to the South American subgenera Mis-andra and Panke. The placement of G. perpensa in a sep-2002] 517WANNTORP ET AL.: GUNNERA PHYLOGENY FIG. 3.

J 5 Java, S 5 Sumatra, SA 5 South Africa, T 5 Tanzania. arate subgenus as suggested by Schindler (1905) is confirmed by our study (Fig.3). Like Panke, Gunnera perpensa is characterised by thick, polystelic rhizomes (Wilkinson 2000), but in contrast to the erect or as-cending unbranched stems of Panke, the rhizomes of G. perpensa are creeping and branching. According to our results (Fig.3), the thick, polystelic rhizomes are not homologous in these two subgenera. The morpho-logical study of Fuller (1995) suggested that the Afri-can species G. perpensa and the Malayan G. macrophylla could ‘‘best be merged into a single lineage.’’ We did not find any support for this result. The position of G. perpensa as sister to the other species of Gunnera, ex-cepting only G. herteri, is, in contrast, a well-supported result of the present study as well as the position of G. macrophylla as sister to Milligania. Gunnera perpensa occurs in South Africa and on mountains along the Great Rift Valley from Zimbabwe and Mozambique, over Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Ken-ya, Tanzania, and Uganda all the way to Sudan and Ethiopia (Boutique and Verdcourt 1973). It is also found in the central parts of Madagascar. Schindler (1905) considered G. perpensa to consist of three vari-eties different in geographic distribution. The variety growing in Madagascar was named angusta due to its narrow inflorescence. The variety kilimandscharica from East Tropical Africa and Ethiopia is said to differ from the South African type specimen by hairless petals and stalked drupes. Skottsberg (1936) considered the sub-genus to include four species, one growing in South Africa, one in Tanzania, one in Ethiopia, and one on Madagascar, and he thought the distribution to be very ancient. We had access to two of Skottsberg’s pre-sumed taxa of G. perpensa, the one from Tanzania and the other from South Africa. Their ITS sequences were not completely identical, but still very similar, differing at a few base pairs only, and grouped together with high support. We could also notice how similar the two plants were in morphology, but the differences re-ported between at least some of the ‘‘varieties’’ seem to us no less than those considered to separate species in the subgenus Panke. Subgenus Pseudogunnera, the Malayan Species. Subgenus Pseudogunnera consists of the single species G. macrophylla, which is widespread in the Malayan area, occurring on mountains in New Guinea, the Sol-518 [Volume 27SYSTEMATIC BOTANY omon Islands, Sulawesi, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Philippines. The analyses based on the single ITS re-gion, as well as on all three gene regions, clearly place G. macrophylla as a well-supported sister to subgenus Milligania, which includes all species from New Zea-land and Tasmania (Figs. 2, 3). In the cladogram from Wanntorp et al. (2001) based on rbcL and rps16 intron only, G. macrophylla was placed inside Milligania as sister group of G. monoica from New Zealand. Because the rps16 intron alone in-stead placed G. macrophylla as sister group to Milligan-ia, the previous result was suspected to have been caused by the isolation of the same paralogous pseu-dogene copy of the rbcL in these two species (Wann-torp et al. 2001). A recent study (Wardle et al. 2001) identified a rbcL sequence from G. monoica of usual length. When this sequence was used in the rbcL anal-ysis there was no longer any indication of a close re-lationship between G. monoica and G. macrophylla. This supports the presence of two copies of the rbcL gene in these species, and that the apparent close relation-ship between G. monoica and G. macrophylla was due to the isolation of a pseudogene. In its large size and reniform leaf shape G. macro-phylla is somewhat similar to G. perpensa and the spe-cies of subgenus Panke, but the Malayan species shares the propagation by slender stolons with the species of subgenus Milligania and Misandra. As in subgenus Mil-ligania, the stolons have two opposite apical bracts, subtending the short erect leafy stem. Also the bright-colored juicy drupes of G. macrophylla, are more similar to the fruits of the species in Milligania than to the greenish, drier drupes mostly present in Panke and G. perpensa. Just as in G. perpensa, individuals of G. macrophylla from different parts of the Malayan area have some-times been hypothesized to belong to different varie-ties or species. For example, plants from Sumatra were identified by van der Post in 1855 as different from specimens from Java. Our study includes one specimen from Sumatra and one from Java. These specimens showed rbcL sequences of different length (Wanntorp et al. 2001). The ITS sequences for these two speci-mens, however, were identical. Subgenus Milligania, the Species from New Zealand and Tasmania. This subgenus includes all species from New Zealand and G. cordifolia from Tasmania which are characterized by small size and propagation by stolons. The present study found four well-sup-ported clades. G. monoica is well-supported as sister to the remainder of Milligania. It has bisexual inflores-cences carrying female flowers basally and male flow-ers apically, and is in this respect similar to G. macro-phylla. In contrast, the other New Zealand species, as well as the Tasmanian G. cordifolia, have male and fe-male flowers on separate inflorescences. The position of the Australian G. cordifolia, securely nested among the New Zealand species, suggests a comparatively late dispersal from New Zealand rather than an ancient vicariance involving the Antarctic con-tinent. If our hypothesis is correct, then the fossil Gun-nera pollen recorded from upper Cretaceous Campan-ian strata in Australia, (Jarzen and Dettmann 1989) must derive not from this species but from more dis-tant relatives, possibly closer to G. macrophylla. Subgenus Misandra, the Stoloniferous South Amer-ican Species. South America is the area with the highest diversity of Gunnera with representatives of three different subgenera. Of these, subgenus Misandra includes small-sized dioecious, perennial species that spread by stolons. The shoot apex is protected by a membranous hood or ochrea, a character that does not occur in any other species of Gunnera. In most other traits these species are quite similar to the species of Milligania, however. Indeed, it was recently suggested that these two subgenera are not clearly distinguish-able on morphological grounds and could perhaps be amalgamated (Wilkinson 2000). Gunnera magellanica is the most widespread of all South American Gunnera species and occurs from Cape Horn and the Falkland Islands along the Andean Cordillera to Colombia (Mora-Osejo 1984). Gunnera lob-ata occurs in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. In the former study (Wanntorp et al. 2001), Misandra was rep-resented by G. magellanica only, which was placed in an unresolved position with members of the subgenus Panke. However, the analysis based on the single rps16 intron showed clear support for G. magellanica as close-ly related to Panke. The ITS study revealed a close re-lationship between G. lobata and G. magellanica. When combining the three different gene regions, the group formed by G. magellanica and G. lobata was found to be the sister group to subgenus Panke. The phylogenetic signal in the rbcL gene had obviously been comple-mented by the ITS data. Despite the general morphological similarity there is no evidence for a close relationship between the sub-genera Misandra and Milligania. Their inclusion in two clearly separate clades is among the most well-sup-ported results of the entire analysis. It seems reason-able to conclude that stolons, which are the main unit-ing character, may have been an ancestral feature in Gunnera, possibly excluding G. perpensa and G. herteri. Their absence in subgenus Panke, then, is due to a loss of this means of vegetative dispersal. Subgenus Panke, the Giants of the Cordilleras. The Andean Cordilleras from Patagonia to Mexico in South and Central America contain the highest species di-versity of subgenus Panke, with at least 20 endemic species, often allopatric and similar in morphology. Outside the Andes, the two species of Gunnera from Hawaii also belong in Panke as do the species from the 2002] 519WANNTORP ET AL.: GUNNERA PHYLOGENY Juan Fernández Islands. Gunnera brasiliensis is also dis-junct from the rest of the subgenus, being restricted to the Serra do Mar near the Atlantic coast in southern Brazil. The difficult demarcation of species and their frequent hybridization (Palkovic 1978; Pacheco et al. 1991) indicate that speciation within Panke is still on-going. It seems reasonable to connect at least most of the diversification of Panke with the uprising of the Andes. This was initiated in the South, already during the Cretaceous, while the Colombian Cordilleras in the north are of Plio-Pleistocene age (Putzer 1968). Neither the previous rbcL/rps16 intron analysis nor the ITS study strongly supported the monophyly of subgenus Panke, which morphologically is very clearly defined. Subgenus Panke are usually large plants with ascending to erect polystelic rhizomes covered by large often frilled scales, palmate leaves and huge com-pound inflorescences. The well-supported association of Misandra and Panke in our analysis, on the other hand, has almost no support in morphological traits, unless, as proposed by Skottsberg (1936), the ‘‘ochrea’’ of Misandra is indeed homologous to the large scales, which are one of the distinguishing features of Panke. As in the rbcL/rps16 intron analysis, the Hawaiian species of subgenus Panke are the sister group of the South American species, but now this relationship is well-supported. Several Gunnera species have been de-scribed from the Hawaiian islands (St. John 1946). Though there seems to be considerable geographical variation, the number has recently been reduced to the two species included in this study, G. petaloidea and G. kauaiensis (Wagner et al. 1990). The Hawaiian species form a very well-supported clade. The resolution within subgenus Panke was higher than in the previous study, but the information in the ITS region is still insufficient to fully resolve the phy-logeny of the American species. However, a significant result was the well-supported position of G. manicata in the tree (Fig.3) and its corroborated identity with G. brasiliensis. There exists considerable confusion about the identity and origin of the frequently culti-vated G. manicata. This species is sometimes considered to have been introduced from Brazil (Linden 1867; Ay-res Fevereiro and Perazzo Barbosa 1976) and to be pos-sibly identical to the wild G. brasiliensis (Schindler 1905). However, it has also been claimed to be of Col-ombian origin (Mora-Osejo 1984). This study consti-tutes a first attempt to clarify the matter phylogeneti-cally. The ITS region of a cultivated plant of G. manicata of garden origin was sequenced as well as the ITS of G. brasiliensis. These sequences were completely iden-tical and the two specimens grouped together with strong support. Among the remaining species, those from the South form a poorly supported clade. Among these, Gunnera chilensis grows in mainland Chile. It is sister to G. mas-afuerae, an endemic to Masafuera (the youngest, and outermost, of the Juan Fernández Islands). These two species are the sister group of G. peltata and G. bracteata which also appear as sister species. The latter two grow on Masatierra (the inner and more ancient of the Juan Fernández Islands), where they form hybrids (Skottsberg 1914, Pacheco et al. 1991). Generally these four ITS sequences differ in very few base pairs. The sequences from the morphologically quite distinct G. peltata and G. bracteata were completely identical. The Juan Fernández Islands are only two to three million years old (Stuessy et al. 1984), and the diversification of these species is likely to have taken place within this time span. In 1959, Macbride suggested that the Peruvian G. bolivari could be closely related to G. bracteata based on smaller leaf size and also on the glabrousness of these plants. A phylogenetic study of the relationship of the Juan Fernández species was undertaken by Pacheco et al. (1993). This was based on flavonoids and morphol-ogy and indicated that G. bolivari is more closely relat-ed to other species such as G. mexicana and G. boliviana than to G. bracteata. On the other hand, flavonoid com-pounds unique to G. chilensis and to the species from Juan Fernández Islands were identified. Based on mor-phological as well as flavonoid data they considered G. chilensis to be the closest mainland relative of all the Juan Fernández species. In a phylogenetic analysis of the relationship of the Juan Fernández species they chose G. chilensis as an outgroup. Gunnera masafuerae was most closely related to G. peltata, but this clade was supported by one morphological character only, while the flavonoid data were uninformative. The pre-sent phylogenetic study for the first time allows the comparison of the species from the Juan Fernández Is-lands with species not only from Chile, but also from Tropical South America, Central America and Hawaii. The close relationship with G. chilensis suggested by Pacheco et al. (1993) is supported (even though G. bo-livari is not included in our analysis). The relationship among the Juan Fernández species, however, is in con-flict since in our analysis G. masafuerae is most closely related to the mainland G. chilensis, rather than to G. peltata from Masatierra. This indicates two separate col-onizations of the Juan Fernandez Islands, one by the ancestor of G. peltata/G. bracteata and the other by G. masafuerae. More information is needed to resolve the positions of G. pilosa from Equador, G. insignis from Panama, and G. talamancana from Costa Rica. The South American species of Panke show a high degree of similarity, morphologically as well as in ITS sequences, which could support a recent origin for this part of the subgenus. If so, the late Cretaceous findings of Gunnera pollen (Jarzen and Dettmann 1989), as well as putative macrofossils of leaves attributed to subge-nus Panke (Wilkinson 2000) from North America comes 520 [Volume 27SYSTEMATIC BOTANY into new light. If Panke, including the Hawaiian spe-cies, is of southern origin, a late diversification seems to rule out the possibility that the North American fos-sils could belong to this clade. If these fossils, on the other hand, truly represent Panke, a quite different and more complicated history for Gunnera may be envi-sioned, involving colonization of South America also from the north. This scenario is in agreement with the basal position of the Hawaiian species. While few or no other close South American relatives of Hawaiian species are known, a relationship between North America and Hawaii is a well-known biogeographic feature (Skottsberg 1936; Vargas et al. 1998).
