S1 to S3 Tables S1 and S2 References  Supporting Online Material  Methods  Bulk sediment samples were washed using a sodium hexametaphosphate solution and picked for benthic foraminifera using the 250 µm size fraction, supplemented with 150- 250 µm specimens where necessary.
Toward the end of this study, picked foraminifera were also briefly sonicated in methanol (Table S1). Foraminiferal samples were hydrolyzed with H3PO4 and reduced to graphite using an Fe catalyst in the presence of H2. The 19 published radiocarbon samples (S1) were graphitized at the National Ocean Sciences AMS Facility in Woods Hole (NOSAMS), while the 31 new samples were graphitized at the INSTAAR Laboratory for AMS Radiocarbon Preparation and Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder (NSRL). All published radiocarbon data (S1) were analyzed at NOSAMS, while all new data were analyzed at the Keck Carbon Cycle AMS Facility at the University of California, Irvine (KCCAMS). δ13C corrections were based on off-line measurement for NOSAMS results, and on measurement within the AMS for KCCAMS results.
KCCAMS δ13C values are not suitable for paleoceanographic interpretation, and are therefore not reported.
Age-corrected 14C calculations were based on the conventions of Stuiver and Polach (S2). 14C error bars were calculated by compounding radiocarbon age errors with estimated calendar age errors listed in Table S1. Calendar age errors depend solely on the estimated precision of our picks with respect to the GISP2-Hulu chronology, and not on any errors in the GISP2-Hulu chronology itself.
The latter would affect both our record and the Cariaco Basin atmospheric 14C record similarly.
Hulu Cave adjustments to GISP2 age model  In order to compare PC08 results with the most recent and most consistent atmospheric 14C reconstructions (S3-S5), the correlation between PC08 reflectance and GISP2 δ18O (S6) (used to derive calendar ages for calculating PC08 14C) requires that the GISP2 chronology be consistent with the Hulu Cave chronology (S7), as outlined in the main text.
Younger than  20-25 kyr BP the Hulu Cave and GISP2 chronologies appear to be consistent with each other, so no corrections need to be applied to the more recent parts of the GISP2 age model (Fig. S1). GISP2 also agrees with the latest NGRIP chronology (GICC05) to within 250 yr over this interval (S8). We adjusted the GISP2 chronology older than 23.4 kyr BP (the start of Interstadial 2) by linearly interpolating between three Hulu Cave tie-points corresponding to major interstadial warmings in Greenland. The resulting GISP2 age model appears to agree with Hulu Cave to within a few hundred years throughout the past 50 kyr (Fig. S1). The resulting age-depth relationship for PC08 is shown in Fig.S2A. Methane synchronization of Dome C and GISP2  As outlined above and in the main text, the GISP2, Hulu Cave, and coral chronologies are similar over the last  20-25 kyr. However, these chronologies differ from the glaciological age model on which the EPICA Dome C CO2 and δD records of Monnin et al. (S9) were originally presented.
To obtain a timescale that is consistent with the various 14C reconstructions, we have used CH4 records from the Dome C, GISP2, and GRIP ice cores (S9-S11) to derive a GISP2 synchronized gas age scale for Dome C.    Seven tie-points (Table S2) were defined based on the comparison of the Dome C CH4 record (on the EDC3 time scale (S12, S13)) and the GISP2 and GRIP CH4 records (on the GISP2 time scale (S10)). Between the tie-points the EDC3 gas age scale was linearly interpolated to GISP2 ages.
The associated ice age scale for Dome C was derived from the synchronized gas age scale described above and the delta ages (gas age to ice age differences in the ice core) taken from the EDC3 time scale (S12, S13). Sedimentary artifacts  The two deglacial intervals of depleted radiocarbon activity that we report appear, in part, as large age plateaus in the conventional radiocarbon age:depth relationship (Table S1). During the first (earlier) event, radiocarbon age is nearly constant over 90 cm of core depth, and during the second event, radiocarbon age is nearly constant over at least 45 cm.
Near-instantaneous massive inputs of sediment, namely slumps, could theoretically produce age plateaus.
However, such events would necessarily produce large kinked offsets in the calendar age:depth relationship, which are clearly not observed (Fig. S2). Additionally, slumps are much more likely to produce age reversals than plateaus.
Radiocarbon age plateaus could also theoretically be created during intervals of very intense bioturbation, such that age is homogenized over some depth interval.
However, it is unreasonable to postulate a complete, simultaneous bioturbational homogenization of the upper 90 cm (or 45 cm) of the sediment column, especially in this low-O2 environment.
The entire MC19/GC31/PC08 record is dominated by low-O2 benthic foraminiferal taxa (mainly Bolivina and Uvigerina), and sedimentary Mo remains enriched by  4-8 times crustal values during deglaciation, indicative of shallow pore water sulfide and suboxic bottom waters (S14). Finally, very intense bioturbation would homogenize other paleoclimate proxies in this core.
Notably, our second age plateau crosses the Allerød-Younger Dryas boundary in GC31/PC08, which is marked by a sharp reflectance change that is inferred to record a shift in surface ocean productivity (S15). We therefore conclude decisively that the 14C age-depth patterns in our record reflect changes in intermediate water 14C activity and not sedimentary processes.
Alternate PC08 age model  We have also calculated Baja California 14C based on correlation to GISP2 using the original layer-counted age model of Meese et al. (S16) (Fig. S3). This record only differs from our preferred GISP2-Hulu age model prior to 23.4 kyr BP. In Fig.S3 we compare this alternate record to the original Cariaco Basin  14C record based on correlation to GISP2 (S17). It is clear that our conclusions are not affected by the choice of age model, though the agreement between Cariaco Basin and coral 14C is better in Fig.1 than in Fig.S3 (S5). The PC08 age-depth relationship for the alternate age model is shown in Fig.S2B. 2      Fig.S1. Derivation of GISP2-Hulu Cave composite age model.

Red points are tie-points and gray points represent radiocarbon measurements.
The unusually constant sedimentation rate allows for relatively precise calendar age assignments between tie-points.
