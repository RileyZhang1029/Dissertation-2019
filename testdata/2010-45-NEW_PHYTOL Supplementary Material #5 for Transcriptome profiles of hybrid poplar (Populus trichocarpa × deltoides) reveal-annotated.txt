Experiments were designed to study temporal and spatial patterns of poplar herbivore defense responses. Each circle indicates a specific leaf type and time point of harvest. Blue circles indicate leaves from untreated control trees; orange circles indicate leaves from trees with local source (LSo) leaves at the base of the tree treated by mechanical wounding and FTC OS application. Each arrow represents a hybridization on a microarray slide; solid arrows indicate dye-flipped direct comparisons between treated and respective control leaves, dashed arrows indicate balanced loops between leaf types or time points for either treated or control samples. LSo, local source leaves; SSo, systemic source leaves; SSi, systemic sink leaves; 2 h, 6 h, or 24 h timepoints. A total of 54 hybridizations were performed.  Figure S2: Comparison of variance and response obtained by microarray hybridizations using samples from individual trees separately or as pooled samples (see Ralph et al., 2006). (a) Similar level of variation of microarray data obtained with separate samples from individual trees (biological and technical variation) or with pooled samples (technical variation). (b) Plot of differential expression of genes measured in 2 h OS-treated samples with pooled tree samples compared to individual tree samples. Number/Count scale from light grey to black correlates with an increasing number of genes in that category.  2   Figure S3: Overall spatial and temporal patterns of differentially expressed (DE) genes in local and systemic leaves in response to FTC OS detected by transcriptome analysis on a microarray platform of 15,496 cDNA elements. Genes were classified as DE between treated (T) and control (C) leaves using a threshold of fold-change > 1.5, P < 0.050, Q < 0.050. The change of transcript abundance for DE genes is shown on the x-axis as ln of fold change between T and C leaves. The number of array elements for each level of change of expression is shown on the y-axis. The 5% most up-or down-regulated genes are outside of the dotted vertical lines. Solid vertical lines mark the minimum and maximum DE. The number of genes significantly up-and down-regulated is given for each leaf type and time point.   Figure S4: Amino acid sequence alignment of galactinol synthases (GOLS). Alignments of protein sequences predicted from cDNA and gDNA sequences were generated using ClustalW (BLOSUM matrix, gap open penalty = 50, gap extension penalty = 0.5) and Boxshade. Conserved similarity shading was based on 50% identity (black) and 50% similarity (grey). A black bar above the alignment indicates a conserved carboxyl terminal pentapeptide signature. The hypothetical manganese-binding motif DXD is indicated with ‘***’. The serine phosphorylation site is indicated with ‘X’. Nomenclature is as follows: Pt, Populus trichocarpa; Ptd, Populus trichocarpa x deltoides; At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Ar, Ajuga reptans; Le, Lycospersicon esculentum; Os, Oryza sativa; Zm, Zea mays. The sequences with identifiers ending with ‘g’ are predicted gene models from the P. trichocarpa v2.0 genome (www.phytozome.net/poplar); corresponding full-length cDNA versions end with a ‘period-number’ designation.

Values represent fold-change (FC) relative to control trees. Values obtained by qPCR represent the mean of three or more independent technical replicates, each consisting of pooled RNA from five biological replicates. A Student’s t-test (two-sample, unpaired, one-sided) was performed to test significance (P) of up-or down-regulation of each transcript between treated and control plants. For each transcript, qPCR data are shaded light-grey, with the corresponding microarray data provided below (see Table S1 for the complete microarray dataset). ‘--‘ indicates that this gene is not represented on the 15.5K microarray.   Methods S1  Microarray hybridization and gene expression data analysis Details of the hybridization protocol for the 15.5K poplar microarray, along with fabrication and quality control details, have been reported in Ralph et al. (2006). For each treatment, leaf group, and time point, equal amounts of total RNA were combined from each of the five biological replicate trees prior to cDNA microarray analysis. Samples were indirectly labelled with Cy5 and Cy3 fluorescent dyes using the 3DNA Array 350 kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA, USA). All microarray experiments were designed to comply with MIAME guidelines (Brazma et al., 2001).  All scanned microarray TIF images, an ImaGene grid, the gene identification file and Imagene quantified data files have been submitted to GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; series GSE16383). A total of fifty-four hybridizations were performed using the hybridization scheme  6  shown in Figure S1. Total RNA samples from OS-treated leaves 2hrs, 6hrs, and 24hrs after treatment from all three leaf types were each compared with total RNA from the corresponding leaf types in control trees harvested at the same time point, using two slides each with a dye-flip [2 x (3x3) = 18 slides]. Balanced loops were also incorporated to compare both OS-treated or control trees, each either to the other two time points for a single leaf type, or to the other two leaf types at a single time point [2 x (3+3) = 12 loops @ 3 slides/loop = 36 slides].   To validate our findings with pooled biological replicates, we also performed additional hybridizations using independent biological replicates to examine differential gene expression in SSi leaves at 2hrs in response to OS-treatment. Total RNA from four individual OS-treated trees was compared directly against four individual untreated control trees using four hybridizations, balanced to have each sample type labelled twice with each dye. Similarly, total RNA from a single pool of OS-treated leaves from each of five independent biological replicate trees (described above) was compared to untreated control leaves from five independent biological replicate trees using four hybridizations, again balanced to have each sample type labelled twice with each dye.  In order to assess the biological response to mechanical damage plus FTC OS (OS), in local source (LSo), systemic source (SSo), and systemic sink leaves (SSi), and through time (2hrs, 6hrs, 24hrs), a mixed-effects model containing a dye effect and a treatment effect for OS minus control (C) was fit using data from 54 microarray slides. In order to assess the differences in variance between microarray experiments involving pooled or individual tree samples, models containing a dye effect and a treatment effect for OS minus C were fit using data from four microarray slides for the individual replicate analysis, and four microarray slides for the pooled replicate analysis. Before data normalization, the lowest 10% of median foreground intensities  7  was subtracted from the median foreground intensities to correct for background intensity. After quantification of the signal intensities, data were normalized to compensate for non-linearity of intensity distributions using the variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) method (Huber et al., 2002). To assess the transcriptional response to stress treatments, a linear mixed-effects model was fitted to the normalized intensities in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels. The model contained an adjustment for dye effect, an array effect indicating which Cy5/Cy3 pair was on each array, and a treatment effect indicating treatment and time point. For both microarray experiments, expression variance was derived from technical variance among slides. The ratio of each treatment parameter estimate to the standard error was used to calculate a t statistic, from which a P-value was obtained. The Q value for each effect and gene was calculated for each of the models to adjust for the false discovery rate (Storey & Tibshirani, 2003). Differentially expressed transcripts were defined as having fold-change ratios >1.5, P<0.05, and Q<0.05.  Cluster analysis was performed on a set of 6,472 array elements showing significant differential expression in at least one sample (i.e., fold-change between treated and control leaves > 1.5x, P < 0.05, and Q < 0.05) using the divisive DIANA algorithm (Bryan, 2004), and the first eight clusters formed were examined in detail. All statistical analyses were performed within the R statistical package (www.r-project.org/), save for two-way ANOVAs and subsequent Tukey tests, which were performed with SYSTAT 11 (Systat Software Incorporated). Table S1 provides a complete list of microarray expression data for all genes represented on the microarray.  Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and gene expression data analysis qPCR was done as previously described (Philippe et al., 2009; Ralph et al., 2006). Prior to reverse transcription, 15 µg total RNA per tree was treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen)  8  according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remove genomic DNA. The resulting RNA was divided into three aliquots of 5 µg and independent cDNA synthesis reactions were performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo d(T18) primer according to manufacturer’s instructions. The efficiency of cDNA synthesis was assessed by gel electrophoresis prior to pooling of the three reactions per tree. Gene-specific primers were designed for microarray validation, for isoprene synthase expression verification, and for galactinol synthase expression analysis (Table S2) using a stringent set of criteria including predicted melting temperature of 64 ± 2°C, primer lengths of 20-24 nucleotides, guanine-cytosine contents of 40-60% and PCR amplicon lengths of 100-350 bp. Primer specificity (single product of expected length) was confirmed by analysis on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel, by melting curve analysis and, for at least one PCR reaction per gene, by sequence verification of PCR amplicons (data not shown). Primers for poplar translation initiation factor 5A (TIF5A) were designed (GenBank accession number CV251327; poplar EST WS0116_J23 [POPTR_0006s19870]) and served as a quantification control (forward primer 5’-GACGGTATTTTAGCTATGGAATTG-3’, reverse primer 5’-CTGATAACACAAGTTCCCTGC-3), as in Ralph et al. (2006).  qPCR was conducted on a DNA Engine Opticon 2 in an optical 96-well plate (MJ Research) using the DyNAmo HS SYBR green kit (Finnzymes) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng cDNA as template, 0.3 µM of each primer and 10 µL of DyNAmo master mix in a final volume of 20 µL. Reactions with the cDNA template replaced by nuclease-free H2O or 10 ng of non-reverse transcribed RNA were run with each primer pair as a control. The program for all PCR reactions was: 95°C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C. Data were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor 2  9  version 2.02 software (MJ Research). For each primer pair a minimum of three independent technical replicates was performed. To generate a baseline-subtracted plot of the logarithmic increase in fluorescence signal (ΔRn) versus cycle number, baseline data were collected between cycles 3 and 10. All amplification plots were analyzed with an Rn threshold of 0.005 to obtain Ct (threshold cycle) values. Transcript abundance for each OS-induced gene was normalized to TIF5A by subtracting the Ct value of TIF5A from the Ct value of each OS-induced transcript, where Ct = Cttranscript-CtTIF5A.  Transcript abundance of OS-induced genes in control and OS-treated samples were obtained from the equation (1 + E)-Ct, where E is the PCR efficiency, as described by Ramakers et al. (2003). A transcript with a relative abundance of one is equivalent to the abundance of TIF5A in the same tissue. In order to assess the biological fold-change response to OS treatment, a mixed effects model for each gene containing a treatment effect for OS minus untreated control (C) was fit using data from at least three independent technical replicates for each of the three leaf groups in OS-treated and untreated control cDNA pools. The ratio of the OS minus C parameter estimate to the standard error was used to calculate a t statistic and P value.    10  References  Brazma A, Hingamp P, Quackenbush J, Sherlock G, Spellman P, Stoeckert C, Aach J, Ansorge W, Ball CA, Causton HC, Gaasterland T, Glenisson P, Holstege FCP, Kim IF, Markowitz V, Matese JC, Parkinson H, Robinson A, Sarkans U, Schulze-Kremer S, Stewart J, Taylor R, Vilo J, Vingron M. 2001.
