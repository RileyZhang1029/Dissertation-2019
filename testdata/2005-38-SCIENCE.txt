Here, we show that overexpression of Klotho in mice extends life span. Klotho protein functions as a circulating hormone that binds to a cell-surface receptor and represses intracellular signals of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for extending life span. Alleviation of aging-like phenotypes in Klotho-deficient mice was observed by perturbing insulin and IGF1 signaling, suggesting that Klotho-mediated inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling contributes to its anti-aging properties. Klotho protein may function as an anti-aging hormone in mammals. Klotho was originally identified as a mutated gene in a mouse strain that accelerates age-dependent loss of function in multiple age-sensitive traits (1). An insertional mutation that disrupts the 5¶ promoter region of the Klotho gene resulted in a strong hypomorphic allele. Mice homozygous for the mutated allele (KLj/j mice) appeared normal until 3 to 4 weeks old but then began to manifest multiple age-related disorders observed in humans, including ectop-ic calcification, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy, osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, and pulmonary emphysema. KLj/j mice suffered premature death around two months of age. The Klotho gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein that is detectable in limited tissues, particularly the distal con-voluted tubules in the kidney and the choroid plexus in the brain.

Notably, some single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human KLOTHO gene are associated with altered life span (3) and altered risk for coronary artery disease (4), osteoporosis (57), and stroke (8). Little is known about Klotho protein function and the molecular mechanism by which it suppresses the development of aging-like pheno-types. The extracellular domain of Klotho protein is composed of two internal repeats, KL1 and KL2, that share amino acid sequence homology to b-glucosidases of bacteria and plants (20 to 40% identity) (1). However, glucosidase activity is not present in recombinant Klotho protein (9), and the essential glutamate residue at the b-glucosidase active center is replaced with asparagine and alanine in KL1 and KL2, respectively (10). Here, we demonstrate that Klotho is an aging suppressor gene whose product functions as a hormone that inhibits intracellular insulin and IGF1 signaling. Klotho overexpression extends life span in mice. We previously generated independent transgenic lines of mice that over-express Klotho under the control of the human elongation factor 1a promoter (1) (EFmKL46 and EFmKL48) (fig. S1). Here, we compared the life span of the transgenic mice with that of wild-type controls that are near-coisogenic by virtue of backcrossing onto the C3H back-ground four times. Each line was previously confirmed to express functional Klotho protein from the transgene (1). Mice carrying the Fig.2. Klotho increases resistance to insulin and IGF1.

Caloric restriction is associated with in-creased longevity in various species (11). To assess whether mice overexpressing Klotho were restricting their own diets, we monitored food intake and oxygen consumption in transgenic and wild-type mice for 24 hours at 32 to 36 weeks of age. No significant differ-ences in these parameters were observed (table S1). Small body size is also associated with extended longevity in diet-restricted mice and in mice that are mutant for pituitary or growth hormone receptor function (12, 13). However, we did not observe any substantial difference in growth between EFmKL46, EFmKL48, and wild-type mice (Fig.1C). Both EFmKL46 and EFmKL48 breeding pairs generated fewer offspring than wild-type breeding pairs (Fig.1D). As expected from the evolutionary theory of longevity, maximum fitness of the organism is a trade-off between life span and fertility (14). These data indicate that Klotho system-ically modulates aging through mechanisms independent of food intake and growth, but potentially in association with reproduction. Klotho increases resistance to insulin and IGF1. Many genetic data demonstrate that inhibited insulin and IGF1 signaling extends life span in animals from C. elegans, to Drosophila, to mice (1521). Because Klotho must mediate aging through effects of a systemic hormone, we investigated whether the Klotho gene is involved in the inhibition of insulin or IGF1 signaling. Mice defective in Klotho gene expression have reduced blood glucose and insulin levels coupled with en-hanced sensitivity to insulin (22). We compared glucose metabolism in the Klotho-overexpressing transgenic mice with wild-type animals. Blood glucose levels were normal in each transgenic line (Fig.2A). However, male EFmKL46 and EFmKL48 mice had higher blood insulin levels than did wild-type males (Fig.2B), suggesting that the male transgenic mice are somewhat insulin resistant. We directly assessed sensitivity to insulin with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (23). As expected, male EFmKL46 and EFmKL48 mice required lower glucose infusion rates than did wild-type males to maintain normal blood glucose levels (Fig.2C). Furthermore, insulin and IGF1 tolerance tests revealed significant attenuation in hypoglycemic response to injected insulin and IGF1 in male transgenic mice (Fig.2, D and E). Although we were unable to detect insulin resistance in female transgenic mice (Fig.2, C and D), they were significantly resistant to IGF1 (Fig.2E). These studies demonstrate that Klotho overexpression induces resistance to insulin and IGF1. Klotho functions as a hormone. The extracellular domain of Klotho is shed on the cell surface and detected in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in mice and humans (24). Immunoblot analysis of plasma with the use of rabbit anti-Klotho antiserum demonstrated that the extracellular Klotho peptide can be detected in wild-type, EFmKL48, and EFmKL46 mice but not in KLj/j mice (fig. S2). Radio-immunoassay further demonstrated that Klotho peptide is È100 pM in wild-type mice and about two times as high in the transgenic overexpression strains (fig. S3). The extra-cellular domain of Klotho may function as a hormone-like substance (2). To assess the function of the Klotho extra-cellular peptide, we generated a soluble form of recombinant Klotho protein comprising the 952amino acid extracellular domain, and de-Fig.3.

Intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.5 U/kg) and purified Klotho extracellular peptide (10 mg/kg, Fig.2F) in wild-type male and female mice atten-uated the hypoglycemic response expected from insulin alone (Fig.2G). Klotho peptide alone rapidly increased blood glucose levels in male wild-type mice and to a smaller extent in females (Fig.2H). However, Klotho peptide injection did not induce significant changes in blood insulin and glucagon levels (fig. S4), suggesting that Klotho peptide inhibits insulin action directly in peripheral tissues. To test whether Klotho antagonizes insulin at receptive cells, we determined whether re-combinant Klotho peptide would reduce glucose uptake by blocking insulin binding to the insulin receptor. We measured cellular glucose uptake in cultured myoblastic cells (L6) incubated with or without insulin in the presence or absence of 100 pM of Klotho extracellular peptide. Klotho peptide suppressed insulin-induced glucose uptake by 55% without reducing the binding of [125I] insulin to the cells (fig. S5). Thus, Klotho does not appear to inhibit ligand-binding to the insulin receptor, suggesting that Klotho may block insulin action by disrupting one or more alternative insulin-dependent intracellular sig-naling pathways. Accordingly, we measured the potential for [125I]-labeled Klotho to bind directly to the cell surface. Hepatoma cells bound [125I] Klotho in a dose-dependent manner and saturated when the total Klotho concentration exceeded 600 pM, and unlabeled Klotho peptide inhibited the binding of [125I] Klotho (fig. S6). Together, these observations suggest that cells present a receptor at their surface other than the insulin receptor that binds to the Klotho peptide. Klotho inhibits intracellular insulin and IGF1 signaling. Because membrane-bound Klotho peptide must inhibit ligand acti-vation of the insulin receptor within the cells, we investigated the influence of Klotho on insulin receptor signal transduction (25, 26). We in-cubated L6 cells or rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE) with recombinant Klotho peptide and insulin (10 nM) or IGF1 (10 nM). Klotho peptide did not inhibit the binding of [125I] insulin or [125I] IGF1 (fig. S5) but suppressed ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin and IGF1 receptors in a dose-dependent man-ner (Fig.3, A and B). Additionally, Klotho reduced activation of signaling events down-stream of receptor activation, including tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2, the association of the subunit of phosphoinositide 3kinase p85 with IRS proteins (Fig.3, A and B). Because the inhibitory effect of Klotho on insulin signaling was observed as early as 1 min after insulin stimulation (Fig.3C), the decline in tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin and IGF1 receptors is unlikely due simply to the loss of receptors. Notably, Klotho peptide can inactivate active insulin receptors that were previously tyrosine phosphorylated by insulin stimulation. In H4IIE cells that were exposed to 10 nM insulin before adding Klotho peptide, Klotho suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (Fig.3D). We observed a similar effect on IGF1 receptor autophospho-rylation in L6 cells with IGF1 before adding Klotho peptide (9). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of Klotho on autophosphorylation of re-ceptor tyrosine kinases is specific. We observed no inhibitory effect of Klotho on the epidermal growth factor receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (fig. S7). Overall, Klotho appears to inhibit activation of the insulin and IGF1 receptor and to repress activated insulin and IGF1 receptors. Whether Klotho peptide functions by accelerating removal of tyrosine phosphorylation from the activated insulin recep-tor remains to be determined. Inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling rescues KLj/j phenotypes. If the ability of Klotho to inhibit insulin and IGF1 signaling extends survival by retarding senescence, in-dependent manipulations to inhibit insulin and IGF1 signaling may ameliorate some of the aging-like phenotypes in KLj/j mice. Accordingly, we crossed a loss-of-function mutation of IRS-1 into the KLj/j mice (27 ). Survival was improved in KLj/j mice het-erozygous for an IRS-1 null allele (KLj/j IRS-1þ/j) relative to KLj/j control mice Fig.4.

In addition, KLj/j IRS-1þ/j mice ameliorated many age-related patholo-gies typical of KLj/j mice, including arterio-sclerosis, ectopic calcification, skin atrophy, pulmonary emphysema, and hypogonadism (Fig.4, C to N). Heterozygosity of IRS-1 alone (KLþ/þ IRS-1þ/j littermates) appears to have no effect on survival and the age-progressive degeneration when compared with those factors in wild-type littermates during these experiments (9). Conclusion. We previously reported that a defect in Klotho gene expression leads to a syndrome that may resemble premature aging (1). Here, we show that overexpression of Klotho can extend life span, and we suggest that Klotho functions as an aging suppressor gene in mammals. We found that the extra-cellular domain of Klotho protein circulates in the blood and binds to a putative cell-surface receptor. Klotho has marked effects on insulin physiology, apparently because it suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin and IGF1 receptors, which results in reduced activity of IRS proteins and their association with PI3-kinase, thereby inhibiting insulin and IGF1 signaling. Extended life span upon negative regulation of insulin and IGF1 signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to sup-press aging (28). Klotho appears to be a peptide hormone to modulate such signaling and thereby mediate insulin metabolism and aging. References and Notes 1. M. Kuro-o et al., Nature 390, 45 (1997). 2. Y.

Gehrels6 Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows have provided important clues to the nature of these massive explosive events, providing direct information on the nearby environment and indirect information on the central engine that powers the burst. We report the discovery of two bright x-ray flares in GRB afterglows, including a giant flare comparable in total energy to the burst itself, each peaking minutes after the burst. These strong, rapid x-ray flares imply that the central engines of the bursts have long periods of activity, with strong internal shocks continuing for hundreds of seconds after the gamma-ray emission has ended. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most power-ful explosions since the Big Bang, with typical energies around 1051 ergs. Long GRBs (du-ration 9 2 s) are thought to signal the creation of black holes by the collapse of massive stars (14). The detected signals from the resulting highly relativistic fireballs consist of prompt gamma-ray emission (from internal shocks in the fireball) lasting for several seconds to minutes, followed by afterglow emission (from external shocks as the fireball encounters surrounding material) covering a broad range of frequencies from radio through x-rays (57). Because of the time needed to accurately determine the GRB position, most afterglow REPORTS 1Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 525 Davey Lab, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. 2Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera, Via Bianchi 46, 23807 Merate, Italy. 3Center for Gravitational Wave Physics, 104 Davey Lab, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. 4Department of Physics, University of Nevada, Box 454002, Las Vegas, NV 891544002, USA. 5Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK. 6NASA/ Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA. 7Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA. 8Agenzia Spaziale Italiana Science Data Center, Via Galileo Galilei, 00044 Frascati, Italy. 9Diparti-mento di Fisica, Università degli studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza delle Scienze 3, 20126 Milan, Italy. 10INAFIstituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Sezione di Palermo, Via Ugo La Malfa 153, 90146 Palermo, Italy. 11Department of Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, MS 105-24, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA. 12Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
