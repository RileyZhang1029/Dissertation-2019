Supplements
Supplement 1.  Crystal diffraction and refinement table.

Supplement 2.  Comparison of domains of MutS with similar structures.  1a79a is tRNA endonuclease, 1t7p is T7 DNA polymerase, 1kny is kanamycin nucleotidyltransferaase, and 1cqq is type 2 rhinovirus 3c protease. HisP is a subunit of histidine permease (PDB: 1b0u).  Two helices of HisP were replaced by a dashed line for clarity.

Supplement 3. CÔÅ° traces of MutS in the absence and presence of DNA (shown as red ribbons).

Supplement 4. Structure-based sequence alignment.  MutS homologues from humans (hMSH), S. Cerevisiae (yMSH), C. elegans (Him14), T. aquaticus, E. coli (gram-negative), and S. pneumoniae (HexA, gram-positive) are shown.  The secondary structures observed in TAQ MutS are indicated above the aligned sequence.  Conserved residues for structural integrity are highlighted in yellow, for DNA recognition in blue, for protein dimerization in green, for ATPase activity in red and for inter-domain interactions in purple.  Residues, of which mutations cause a dominant negative phenotype in E. coli 50, defective mismatch repair in yeast 32,36,48,49, defective crossing-over in C. Elegans35, or HNPCC in humans 3,4 are coloured red or, if they are highlighted in purple and red, white.  The five nucleotide-binding motifs are indicated beneath the sequence alignment.

Supplement 5. Electrostatic surface of MutS.  Blue represents positive, and red negative, potentials.  Side views of subunit A (a) and B (b) reveals distinct depressions.  The yellow arrow points to the site that MutS may interact with MutL.
