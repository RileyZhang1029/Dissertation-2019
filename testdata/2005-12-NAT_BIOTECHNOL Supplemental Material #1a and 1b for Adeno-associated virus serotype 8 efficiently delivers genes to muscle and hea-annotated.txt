(a) Fluorescent microscopy (20 seconds exposure) of cryosections and anti-GFP immuno-fuorescence (IF) staining showed that the GFP expressions only existed in interstitial tissues, but not in spermatocytes of seminiferous tubules. In immuno-staining, the same section was counter-stained with DAPI (label the nuclei) to show the detailed histological structure. Control is the testis of untreated mouse. (b) Quantitative analysis of vector DNA in testis. The data was from 3 mice and presented a s mean ± s.e. Scale bar, 100 m.
