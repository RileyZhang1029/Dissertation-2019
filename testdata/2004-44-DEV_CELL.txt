In lymphoid cells, acids (aa), suggesting that it is a splice variant of RIAM.
The open reading frame of RIAM is 1998 bp and encodes a protein of 665 aa.
The human RIAM gene locus is*Correspondence: vassiliki_boussiotis@dfci.harvard.edu Developmental Cell 586 Sequence analysis indicated that RIAM contains a RA (RalGDS/AF-6 or Ras-association) domain, a PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, and two proline-rich regions.
Two putative coiled-coil regions are present at the N terminus (aa 6289 and aa 149181) (Figure 1C).
RIAM Belongs to the MRL Family of Adaptor Molecules Database searches revealed that RIAM has similarities with Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 adaptor molecules.
The protein with highest homology to RIAM is Lamellipodin (Lpd) (KIAA1681, AY494951) and Lpd-S (ALS2CR9, BAB69020), characterized in the accompanying article by Krause et al.(2004 [this issue of Developmental Cell]).
Furthermore, RIAM is related to proteins CG11940 (AAF49029) in D. melanogaster and Mig-10 (P34400) in C. elegans (Figure 1C).
Comparison of the domain structure of these proteins indicated that they comprise two distinct families (Figure 1C).
Grb7-related proteins have a conserved central region containing a RA domain and a PH domain (Manser and Wood, 1990; Wojcik et al., 1999), a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain at their C-terminal region, and a between PH and SH2 (BPS) domain (Han et al., 2001).
In contrast, RIAM, Lpd, CG11940, and Mig-10 lack SH2 and BPS domains and have a proline-rich region at the C terminus.
Moreover, all proteins in the latter group contain a highly conserved pattern of 27 aa predicted to be a coiled-coil region immediately N-terminal of the RA domain.
In addition, comparison of the RA and PH domains shows differences between the Grb7/10/14and RIAM-related proteins and conserved regions among the proteins within each group (Supplemental Figure S1 at http://www.developmentalcell.com/cgi/content/full/7/4/585/DC1/).
Dendrograms of sequence relatedness of full-length protein (Figure 1D), the RA and PH domains (data not shown), confirmed that Grb7-and RIAM-related proteins are separated into two distinct families.
We propose to name the family of RIAM-related adaptor molecules the MRL (Mig-10/RIAM/Lpd) family.Figure 1.

RIAM interacts withRalGDS-RBD, which interacts with Rap1-GTP (Reedquist and Bos, 1998) and has been used to determine Profilin and Ena/VASP proteins, important regulators of Developmental Cell 592 Our data showed that in T cells, RIAM and active Rap1 induced a comparable increase in cell adhesion and RIAM expression is required for Rap1E63-mediated adhesion.
Interestingly, in HEK293 cells, in which expression of either RIAM or Rap1 could induce adhesion, we detected only minimal expression of RIAM protein.
It is possible that these low levels of RIAM in HEK293 cells are sufficient to mediate Rap1-induced adhesion.
It is also possible that Rap1 may induce adhesion by mechanisms that do not require RIAM.
Consistent with the latter possibility is our recent observation that Rap1E63transfected HEK293 cells have increased number of focal adhesions but a low change in active conformation of 1 integrins (E.M.L., C.V.C., A.A.F.L.v.P., M.K., A.B., and V.A.B., unpublished data).
Thus, in certain cell types, Rap1 may mediate increase in adhesion by regulatingFigure 7.
