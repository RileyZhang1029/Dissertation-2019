Therefore, using this system, the biologic and genetic determinants of drug action can mide (CTX), an alkylating agent that is used against lymphomas and other malignancies.

To extend these results, we compared the tumor-free survival (i.e., time-to-relapse)and contrast the impact of these lesions on treatment sensitivity, we generated a panel of primary lymphomas and overall survival of CTX-treated mice harboring tumors lacking p53 or overexpressing Bcl2.

Retransplantation of the ctrl.HSC-CTX Induces a p53-Dependent Cell-Cycle Arrest In Vivo bcl2 lymphomas into several recipients each allowed us to examine the same lymphoma in the presence andThe fact that ctrl.-bcl2 tumors remain viable but static for extended periods suggests that CTX can engage a absence of CTX therapy.
Such tumors are comparable, since the response of the same tumor treated in twop53-dependent cell-cycle arrest program.
Therefore, we measured cell proliferation and p53 expression in CTX-different mice is similar (Schmitt and Lowe, 2001).
Upon manifestation of transplanted tumors, LNs weretreated lymphomas overexpressing Bcl2.

To circumvent this problem, MSCV-bcl2-trans-proliferation marker Ki-67.
In contrast to untreated lymphomas, CTX-treated tumors completely lacked mitoticduced hematopoietic stem cells (HSC; derived from E myc transgenic fetal livers) were used to reconstitute figures and were BrdU and Ki67 negative (Figure 2A).
Moreover, ctrl.HSC-bcl2 tumors displayed sustained in-the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated recipient Cell 338 lymphomagenesis (Schmitt et al., 2002).
Consequently, these tumors remained p53/, even upon transplantation into recipient mice (Figure 2C, lane 1, 4/4 tested).
However, neither gene prevented p53 loss during therapy, since most of these lymphomas became p53 null after two administrations of CTX (2/5 for p53/HSC-bcl2, Figure 2C; 2/2 for p53/HSC-C9DN, data not shown).
Concordantly, p53 null lymphomasirrespective of their Bcl2 statusdid not arrest following CTX therapy (data not shown).
Therefore, disruption of a p53-dependent arrest program promotes treatment failure.
Contribution of the INK4a/ARF Locus to Tumor Onset and Treatment Outcome We gained further insights into the determinants of drug action by studying the INK4a/ARF locus during tumor development and therapy.
Tumors of different genotypes were generated by intercrossing E-myc transgenic animals to either p53/, ARF/ mice (targeting exon 1), or INK4a/ARF/ (targeting exons 2 and 3), all in the C57BL/6 genetic background (see Figure 3A).
Consistent with results from mixed backgrounds (Schmitt et al., 1999), tumors arising in each mutant arose with a similar latency yet much more rapidly than controls (p 0.0001, median onset: 32, 34, and 47 days for p53/, INK4a/ARF/, and ARF/ animals, respectively; compare to 139 days for E-myc controls; see Supplemental Data available online at http://www.cell.
com/cgi/content/full/109/3/335/DC1).
Importantly, almost all tumors arising in p53/ and INK4a/ARF/ animals lost the wild-type allele and became p53 or INK4a/ ARF null, respectively (Figure 3A and Schmitt et al., 1999).
None of the lymphomas arising in the ARF/ background expressed detectable protein (Figure 3A;Figure 2.

Consequently, ARF is the sole product of the INK4a/ARF locus that suppresses myc-induced lymphomagenesis.
INK4a/ARF mutations can compromise therapy in E-creases in p53 expression post-therapy (Figure 2B).
Therefore, CTX is cytostatic to p53-expressing tumors myc lymphomas (Schmitt et al., 1999).

To our surprise, the ARF null and INK4a/ARF null lymphomas behaved differently: the ARF null groupform in recipient mice (p53/HSC-bcl2 or p53/HSC-C9DN, respectively).
Both genes block apoptosis downstream responded much better than the INK4a/ARF null group (Figure 3B, p 0.002), with tumor-free survival ratesof p53, and are sufficient to prevent p53 loss during Drug-Induced Senescence In Vivo 339 Figure 3.
The INK4a/ARF Locus in Tumor Development and Treatment Responses (A) Allelic losses in lymphomas arising in either INK4a/ARF/ or ARF/ genetic backgrounds are illustrated schematically.
Greater than 90% of the INK4a/ARF/ derived lymphomas inactivate in 90% both gene products by deletions involving exon 2 (28/31 cases; data not shown).
By contrast, only 65% of ARF/ derived lymphomas (13/20 tested) lost exon 1 (ARF null 1; data not shown).
Those that retained exon 1 (ARF null1, 7/20 tested) may disrupt ARF through loss of exon 2 instead, thereby creating INK4a heterozygosity.
Concordantly, no ARF protein was detected by immunoblotting in any of the ARF/ lymphomas tested (17/17, examples for ARF null1 [a, b] and for ARF null 1 [c, d] are shown along with p53/ and INK4a/ARF/ MEFs and p53 null, ctrl., and INK4a/ARF null lymphomas for comparison), and Southern blot analysis revealed an almost 50% reduction of exon 2 copy number for ARF null1 lymphomas relative to ARF null 1 lymphomas (n 5 each; mean signal intensity SD).

Consequently, the INK4a/ARF null group had a much worse prognosis their association with poor outcome provides additional evidence that the INK4a status influences treatment sen-than the ARF null group ([Figure 3C], 10% versus Cell 340 sitivity.
For example, E-myc lymphomas can acquire homozygous deletions of the INK4a/ARF locus (Eischen et al., 1999), and these lesions can be detected by multiplex PCR analysis of genomic DNA using exon-specific primers (see schematic diagram in Figure 3A).
Biallelic loss restricted to exon 1 was never observed, and losses restricted to exon 1 (the ARF exclusive first exon) were extremely rare (1/52 cases).
However, homozygous deletions involving exon 2 were relatively common, occurring in 27% (14/52) of the cases (data not shown).
When the CTX response of ctrl.
lymphomas was stratified based on their exon 2 status, those with a homozygous deletion of exon 2 responded poorly (p 0.016), much like the INK4a/ARF null group (Figure 4A, compare to 3B).
The response of ARF null tumors could be further stratified based on the pretreatment status of exon 1 (Figure 4A).
As shown above, ARF null lymphomas can arise with (ARF null1) or without (ARF null 1) exon 1 genomic sequences.
Remarkably, mice harboring ARF null1 tumors responded as poorly as those bearing lymphomas with engineered or spontaneous INK4a/ARF deletions (Figure 4A, see also Figure 3B).
Moreover, multiplex PCR analysis of lymphoma DNA isolated after two rounds of CTX therapy revealed that the majority had completely lost exon 2 (4 of 6 tested, Figure 4B, compare lane 2 to 3).
Therefore, INK4a deletions provide a selective advantage to tumor cells during chemotherapy.
That most ARF null1 lymphomas lost one copy of exon 2 during tumor development may have predisposed these tumors to loss of the other allele during CTX therapy (see Figure 3A).
By contrast, mice harboring ARF null 1 lymphomas displayed a superb prognosis (p 0.046, compared to ARF null1), even superior to ctrls.
(Figure 4A).
One explanation for this is that ctrl.
lymphomas comprise a heterogeneous group, including subsets acquiring INK4a/ARF deletions or p53 mutations (Eischen et al., 1999; Schmitt et al., 1999) that negatively bias their overall response.
However, the ARF null group never con-Figure 4.

Whether cellular senescence occurs in vivo is controversial, but SA-resistant to this agent.
We used a unique murine lym phoma model to show that the anti-tumor activity of-gal-positive cells accumulate in older individuals (Dimri et al., 1995).
Most importantly, however, the program CTX depends on its ability to induce both apoptosis and senescence.
Tumors lacking both programs rapidlyis controlled by the p53 and p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathways (Campisi, 2001).

In fibroblasts and epithelial cells, senescence is controlled by the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways, although the contribution of each pathway to the program depends on species and cell type (e.g., Randle et al., 2001).
Cell-cycle arrest is considered permanent, and is accompanied by changes in gene expression and upregulation of SA-gal activity.
Here, drug-induced arrest was accompanied by substantial increases in p53, p16INK4a (an Rb regulator linked exclusively to senescence), PML, and SA--gal activity (Figures 2, 5, and 7).
Disruption of either p53 or INK4a disabled the arrest program, prevented SA--gal accumulation, and acquired loss of either gene often accompanied progression of once dormant tumors to a terminal stage (Figures 2, 5, and 7).
The latter observation is consistent with the possibility that CTXinduced cytostasis is stable, and its escape requires rare pre-existing mutations that disable the program.
Importantly, the senescence program contributed to treatment outcome, since mice harboring tumors capable of senescence but not apoptosis had a substantially better post-therapy prognosis than those harboring tumors with defects in both processes (Figures 1 and 3).
Cellular senescence may parallel apoptosis as a global response to stress.
Indeed, we see that both apoptosis and senescence contribute to drug action, and that loss of either process promotes treatment failure.
Interestingly, certain agents that trigger apoptosis in one cell type induce senescence in another, and p53 and the INK4a/ARF locus encode important regulators of both processes.
Why some cells undergo apoptosis while others senesce is not known, but we note that drug-induced senescence is most pronounced in the presence of an apoptotic block.
This suggests that senescence can serve as a backup to apoptosis, and may explain the inability of Bcl2 to enhance clonogenic survival following drug treatment in vitro (Brown and Wouters, 1999).
This backup may be particularly important in cell types not naturally prone to apoptosis or in solid cancers that have acquired an apoptotic block during the course of tumor evolution.
