We show that primary murine lymphomas also re- spond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16INK4a. Hence, tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations but not those lack- ing ARF alone respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo. Moreover, tumors harboring a Bcl2- mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cy- tostasis involving the accumulation of p53, p16INK4a, and senescence markers, and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage.
Finally, mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with se- nescence defects.
Therefore, cellular senescence con- tributes to treatment outcome in vivo. Introduction Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for sys- temic malignancies.
However, some tumors are inher- ently insensitive to chemotherapeutic agents and others acquire resistance upon relapse.
Most conventional agents damage cellular components, often DNA, and for years it was assumed that this damage was directly responsible for their anti-tumor effect (Johnstone et al., 2002). Consequently, drug resistance was thought to arise primarily from changes that prevented the drug- target interaction, including overexpression of drug ef- flux pumps (e.g., P-glycoprotein) or intracellular detoxifi- ers (e.g., glutathione). It is now clear that drug-induced damage is not invariably lethal, but can instead initiate a series of post-damage responses including apoptosis, cell-cycle checkpoints, mitotic catastrophe, and cellular senescence (Chang et al., 1999 Johnstone et al., 2002). Accordingly, the integrity of these damage responses might also influence treatment sensitivity.
Apoptosis is a well-characterized post-damage pro- gram that contributes to drug action (Johnstone et al., 2002). Diverse anticancer agents can induce apoptosis 3 Correspondence: lowe@cshl.edu 4 Present address: Max-Delbru ck-Center for Molecular Medicine and Charite /Campus Virchow-Hospital, Department of Hematology/On- cology, Humboldt University, D-13353 Berlin, Germany. through common pathways and, consequently, muta- tions that disable these pathways can confer multidrug resistance (Lowe et al., 1993). For example, the Bcl2 oncoprotein is a potent suppressor of apoptosis that can produce multidrug resistance in cultured cells and animal models, and Bcl2 overexpression correlates with poor treatment outcome in some clinical settings (John- stone et al., 2002). Nevertheless, despite extensive ef- forts, the overall contribution of apoptotic defects to clinical drug resistance has been difficult to assess.
Many of the genes that control apoptosis during tumor development can also influence treatment sensitivity.
For example, the p53 tumor suppressor promotes apo- ptosis in response to stress-inducing stimuli, and, in turn, p53 inactivation facilitates tumor development (Vo- gelstein et al., 2000). Anticancer agents also activate p53 to promote apoptosis, and loss of p53 function can promote drug resistance in cultured cells and animal models (e.g., Lowe et al., 1993 Schmitt et al., 1999). Hence, p53 mutations can simultaneously account for a survival advantage during tumor development and in- herent resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.
Of note, p53 can also engage several cell-cycle checkpoints and trigger cellular senescence (Bunz et al., 1998 Chang et al., 1999 Kastan et al., 1991 Suzuki et al., 2001 Wald- man et al., 1997), although the extent to which these processes contribute to drug action in vivo is not known.
Like p53, the INK4a/ARF locus is frequently mutated in human cancers and has been linked to treatment sensitivity.
This locus encodes two tumor suppressors ARF and p16INK4a that share coding sequence trans- lated in different reading frames (Sherr, 2001a). ARF can activate p53 by interfering with its negative regulator Mdm2. Most studies show that ARF is not induced by DNA damage but can potentiate a DNA damage re- sponse (de Stanchina et al., 1998 Kamijo et al., 1999). Instead, ARF is induced by mitogenic oncogenes, per- haps as part of a failsafe mechanism that counters hyperproliferative signals (Sherr, 2001a). By contrast, p16INK4a is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that pro- motes cell-cycle arrest via the Rb tumor suppressor pathway.
INK4a regulation is poorly understood, but its expression increases with the onset of cellular senes- cence (Alcorta et al., 1996 Hara et al., 1996 Robles and Adami, 1998 Serrano et al., 1997). Mutations affecting both INK4a and ARF are common in malignant tumors, although disruption of either gene alone promotes tu- morigenesis in mice and humans (Ruas and Peters, 1998 Sherr, 2001b). INK4a/ARF deletions correlate with poor treatment outcome in patients and in mouse mod- els (Maloney et al., 1999 Schmitt et al., 1999), although the precise contribution of each gene product to treat- ment sensitivity has not been examined.
The determinants of drug action are typically studied in tumor-derived cell lines treated in culture or as xeno- grafts.
Animal models that recapitulate the genetics and pathobiology of human malignancies provide powerful alternatives, since these systems are experimentally tractable yet utilize spontaneous tumors treated at their natural site.

We previously devel- oped methods for rapidly producing E -myc lymphomas with compound genetic lesions, as well as strategies for studying treatment responses that parallel clinical trials (Schmitt et al., 1999, 2000b, 2002). As in human cancers, mutations that disrupt p53 or the INK4a/ARF locus compromise therapy in E -myc lymphomas (Schmitt et al., 1999). Therefore, using this system, the biologic and genetic determinants of drug action can be studied in a relevant setting, yet in a manner not possible in patients.
Here, we use the E -myc model to explore the biologic and genetic basis for drug action and drug resistance, and find that a senescence pro- gram controlled by p53 and p16INK4a is an important deter- minant of treatment outcome in vivo. Results Nonapoptotic Functions of p53 Contribute to Treatment Outcome The ability of p53 to induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage is considered an important determinant of drug action.
Concordantly, both loss of p53 and over- expression of Bcl2 (which acts downstream of p53 to suppress apoptosis) compromise therapy in E -myc lymphomas (Schmitt et al., 1999, 2000b). To compare and contrast the impact of these lesions on treatment sensitivity, we generated a panel of primary lymphomas with defined genetic lesions (Schmitt et al., 2000b). We introduced retroviral vectors expressing green fluores- cent protein (GFP) alone (MSCV), or coexpressing Bcl2 and GFP (MSCV-bcl2), into primary E -myc lymphomas arising in control (ctrl.) or p53  animals.
Note that lym- phomas arising in p53  mice invariably lose the wild- type p53 allele and become p53 null.
This procedure produced four lymphoma populations, designated as ctrl.-MSCV, ctrl.-bcl2, p53 null-MSCV, and p53 null-bcl2, respectively (Table 1). Retrovirally transduced cells were immediately injected into tail veins of syngeneic recipi- ent mice, where the transplanted GFP-tagged lym- phoma cells establish tumors histopathologically indis- tinguishable from the primary malignancies (Schmitt et al., 1999, 2000b). Thus, recipient animals developed sys- temic lymphomas in which only malignant cells were fluorescent.
Previous studies have shown that GFP can be visual- ized in tumor xenografts by whole-body fluorescence imaging (Yang et al., 2000). Here, manifestations of GFP- tagged E -myc lymphomas were readily visualized in the lymph nodes (LN), bone, and other organs of recipi- ent mice precisely matching the anatomical locations predicted from pathological evaluation (Figure 1A). Lym- phoma-bearing mice were treated with cyclophospha- mide (CTX), an alkylating agent that is used against lymphomas and other malignancies.
Ctrl.-MSCV tumors typically responded rapidly to CTX, with no GFP fluores- cence detectable by 24 hr or thereafter (Figure 1A). In contrast, p53 null-MSCV tumors underwent a delayed response, and invariably relapsed (Figure 1A). Remark- ably, ctrl.-bcl2-transduced tumors displayed virtually no response to CTX, even though it was administered at the maximum tolerated dose.
The initial response of these tumors parallels what has been observed in mouse cohorts (Schmitt et al., 1999, 2000b), and indicates that CTX action engages both p53-dependent and indepen- dent apoptotic programs.
Although the ctrl.-bcl2 tumors failed to regress follow- ing therapy, they did not progress for extended periods (Figure 1A). This is in marked contrast to p53 null-MSCV and p53 null-bcl2 tumors, which progressed rapidly (Fig- ure 1A, and data not shown). To extend these results, we compared the tumor-free survival (i.e., time-to-relapse) and overall survival of CTX-treated mice harboring tu- mors lacking p53 or overexpressing Bcl2. As expected, both lesions prevented mice from achieving long-lasting remissions (Figure 1B compare to ctrl.-MSCV). How- ever, mice harboring ctrl.-bcl2 lymphomas lived much longer than mice with p53 null lymphomas (Figure 1B p  0.0001, e.g., at 30 days: 75% overall survival for ctrl.-bcl2 versus 0% for both p53 null groups). Bcl2 did not affect overall survival in the p53 null group, implying that neither its potential role in delaying cell-cycle entry nor its impact on p53-independent apoptosis alters out- come in this model.
Still, unlike the ctrl.-MSCV group, all mice harboring ctrl.-bcl2 lymphomas eventually suc- cumbed to their disease (Figure 1B p  0.0061  50% versus 0% overall survival at day 100, respectively). Therefore, the initial response to CTX does not neces-  Drug-Induced Senescence In Vivo 337 Figure 1.
Contribution of p53 and Bcl2 to Treatment Responses (A) Mice harboring ctrl.-MSCV, p53 null-MSCV, and ctrl.-bcl2 lymphomas were treated at comparable tumor burdens (day 0) with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and monitored by whole-body fluorescence imaging.
Representative examples are shown.

sarily predict treatment outcome.
The fact that Bcl2 does not recapitulate the impact of p53 loss on overall survival implies that nonapoptotic p53 functions are im- portant in treatment sensitivity.
CTX Induces a p53-Dependent Cell-Cycle Arrest In Vivo The fact that ctrl.-bcl2 tumors remain viable but static for extended periods suggests that CTX can engage a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest program.
Therefore, we measured cell proliferation and p53 expression in CTX- treated lymphomas overexpressing Bcl2. Of note, a sub- set of lymphomas arising in E -myc transgenic mice acquires spontaneous mutations in the p53 pathway, which produces a heterogeneous cohort of ctrl. lympho- mas with and without functional p53 (Eischen et al., 1999). To circumvent this problem, MSCV-bcl2-trans- duced hematopoietic stem cells (HSC derived from E - myc transgenic fetal livers) were used to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated recipient mice, where they rapidly formed aggressive lymphomas (ctrl.HSC-bcl2, Table 1) (Schmitt et al., 2002). Importantly, apoptosis is the only p53 effector function that sup- presses myc-driven lymphomagenesis, so these Bcl2 expressing lymphomas preserve an intact p53 pathway (Schmitt et al., 2002). Retransplantation of the ctrl.HSC- bcl2 lymphomas into several recipients each allowed us to examine the same lymphoma in the presence and absence of CTX therapy.
Such tumors are comparable, since the response of the same tumor treated in two different mice is similar (Schmitt and Lowe, 2001). Upon manifestation of transplanted tumors, LNs were either harvested directly (untreated) or 7 days after CTX treatment.
Cell proliferation was estimated by counting mitotic figures, measuring the in vivo incorporation of 5-bromo-2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU), or by staining with the proliferation marker Ki-67. In contrast to untreated lym- phomas, CTX-treated tumors completely lacked mitotic figures and were BrdU and Ki67 negative (Figure 2A). Moreover, ctrl.HSC-bcl2 tumors displayed sustained in-  Cell 338 Figure 2.
Role of p53 in Drug-Induced Arrest (A) Ctrl.HSC-bcl2 lymphomas were transplanted into several recipients each.
Upon tumor formation, parallel tumors originating from the same initial lymphoma were resected from either untreated animals or 7 days post-CTX therapy.
Lymph-node sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H/E [top] high power field arrows point to mitotic figures) or underwent immunostaining using anti-BrdU or anti-Ki67 antibodies (representative medium power fields are shown).

creases in p53 expression post-therapy (Figure 2B). Therefore, CTX is cytostatic to p53-expressing tumors that are insensitive to apoptosis.
If p53 contributes to a prognostically significant arrest program following CTX therapy, then p53 mutations should confer a selective advantage to tumor cells dur- ing therapy, even in the presence of an apoptotic block.
Therefore, we introduced MSCV-bcl2 or a dominant- negative caspase 9 (MSCV-C9DN) into p53  E -myc transgenic fetal liver cells, and allowed lymphomas to form in recipient mice (p53  HSC-C9DN, respectively). Both genes block apoptosis downstream of p53, and are sufficient to prevent p53 loss during HSC-bcl2 or p53   lymphomagenesis (Schmitt et al., 2002). Consequently, these tumors remained p53  , even upon transplanta- tion into recipient mice (Figure 2C, lane 1, 4/4 tested). However, neither gene prevented p53 loss during ther- apy, since most of these lymphomas became p53 null after two administrations of CTX (2/5 for p53  HSC-bcl2, Figure 2C 2/2 for p53  HSC-C9DN, data not shown). Con- cordantly, p53 null lymphomas irrespective of their Bcl2 status did not arrest following CTX therapy (data not shown). Therefore, disruption of a p53-dependent arrest program promotes treatment failure.
Contribution of the INK4a/ARF Locus to Tumor Onset and Treatment Outcome We gained further insights into the determinants of drug action by studying the INK4a/ARF locus during tumor development and therapy.
Tumors of different geno- types were generated by intercrossing E -myc trans- genic animals to either p53  , ARF  mice (targeting exon 1 ), or INK4a/ARF  (targeting exons 2 and 3), all in the C57BL/6 genetic background (see Figure 3A). Consistent with results from mixed backgrounds (Schmitt et al., 1999), tumors arising in each mutant arose with a similar latency yet much more rapidly than controls (p  0.0001, median onset: 32, 34, and 47 days for p53  , INK4a/ARF  , and ARF  animals, respec- tively compare to 139 days for E -myc controls see Supplemental Data available online at http://www.cell. com/cgi/content/full/109/3/335/DC1). Importantly, al- most all tumors arising in p53  and INK4a/ARF  ani- mals lost the wild-type allele and became p53 or INK4a ARF null, respectively (Figure 3A and Schmitt et al., 1999). None of the lymphomas arising in the ARF  background expressed detectable protein (Figure 3A 17/17 tested, hereafter designated ARF null), whereas only ⵑ65% showed loss of exon 1 (ARF null 1  see also Eischen et al., 1999). Interestingly, Southern blots using an exon-2-specific probe suggested that those ARF null tumors in which exon 1 was retained (ARF null1 ) had heterozygous deletions encompassing exon 2 (Figure 3A, p  0.05). TUNEL analysis of LN sections revealed that p53 null, INK4a/ARF null and ARF null lymphomas were less prone to spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting that loss of apoptosis contributed to rapid lymphoma onset (Supplemental Data at above URL). In contrast, disruption of Rb or INK4a alone had no impact on the onset of E -myc lymphomas (Krimpenfort et al., 2001 Schmitt et al., 1999). Consequently, ARF is the sole product of the INK4a/ARF locus that suppresses myc-induced lymphomagenesis. INK4a/ARF mutations can compromise therapy in E - myc lymphomas (Schmitt et al., 1999). Since loss of ARF disables p53 during lymphomagenesis and ARF can po- tentiate DNA damage responses (de Stanchina et al., 1998 Kamijo et al., 1999 Schmitt et al., 1999), we ex- pected treatment responses of ARF null and INK4a ARF null lymphomas to be similar.
Lymphomas of the genotypes described above were propagated in synge- neic recipients and treated with CTX upon tumor mani- festation. To our surprise, the ARF null and INK4a/ARF null lymphomas behaved differently: the ARF null group responded much better than the INK4a/ARF null group (Figure 3B, p  0.002), with tumor-free survival rates  Drug-Induced Senescence In Vivo 339 Figure 3.
The INK4a/ARF Locus in Tumor Development and Treatment Responses (A) Allelic losses in lymphomas arising in either INK4a/ARF  or ARF  genetic backgrounds are illustrated schematically.
Greater than 90% of the INK4a/ARF  derived lymphomas inactivate in 90% both gene products by deletions involving exon 2 (28/31 cases data not shown). By contrast, only ⵑ65% of ARF  derived lymphomas (13/20 tested) lost exon 1 (ARF null 1  data not shown). Those that retained exon 1 (ARF null1 , 7/20 tested) may disrupt ARF through loss of exon 2 instead, thereby creating INK4a heterozygosity. Concordantly, no ARF protein was detected by immunoblotting in any of the ARF  lymphomas tested (17/17, examples for ARF null1  [a, b] and for ARF null 1 [c, d] are shown along with p53  and INK4a/ARF  MEFs and p53 null, ctrl., and INK4a/ARF null lymphomas for comparison), and Southern blot analysis revealed an almost 50% reduction of exon 2 copy number for ARF null1  lymphomas relative to ARF null 1 lymphomas (n  5 each mean signal intensity  SD).

similar to those of ctrl. lymphoma bearing mice.
There- fore, INK4a mutations apparently compromise treat- ment outcome.
We next examined the impact of ARF or INK4a/ARF deletions on tumor-free and overall survival following CTX therapy in the presence and absence of Bcl2 (Figure 3C). The overall survival of mice bearing ARF null-MSCV tumors was similar to controls (compare to ctrl.-MSCV in Figure 1B), and superior to mice bearing p53 null- MSCV lymphomas (p  0.0025 compare to Figure 1B). In contrast, mice harboring INK4/ARF null-MSCV lym- phomas rapidly progressed to a terminal stage (p  0.0278 for overall survival of ctrl.-MSCV [Figure 1B] ver- sus INK4/ARF null-MSCV [Figure 3C]). Consequently, the INK4a/ARF null group had a much worse prognosis than the ARF null group ([Figure 3C], 10% versus  60% surviving at 50 days post-therapy, respectively). Interestingly, whereas Bcl2 had no impact on overall survival in the p53 null group, it reduced overall survival in the INK4a/ARF null setting (p  0.0007). In fact, the overall survival of the INK4/ARF null-bcl2 group ap- proached that of both p53 null groups (Figure 3C com- pare to Figure 1B). This suggests that INK4a loss and disruption of apoptosis by Bcl2 act independently to promote drug resistance.
Selection Against INK4a Genes In Vivo The above experiments describe how engineered dele- tions at the INK4a/ARF locus affect treatment outcome.
Spontaneous mutations also occur at this locus, and their association with poor outcome provides additional evidence that the INK4a status influences treatment sen-  Cell 340 Figure 4.

HSC-MSCV and INK4a/ARF   sitivity. For example, E -myc lymphomas can acquire homozygous deletions of the INK4a/ARF locus (Eischen et al., 1999), and these lesions can be detected by multi- plex PCR analysis of genomic DNA using exon-specific primers (see schematic diagram in Figure 3A). Biallelic loss restricted to exon 1 was never observed, and losses restricted to exon 1 (the ARF exclusive first exon) were extremely rare (1/52 cases). However, homo- zygous deletions involving exon 2 were relatively com- mon, occurring in 27% (14/52) of the cases (data not shown). When the CTX response of ctrl. lymphomas was stratified based on their exon 2 status, those with a homozygous deletion of exon 2 responded poorly (p  0.016), much like the INK4a/ARF null group (Figure 4A, compare to 3B). The response of ARF null tumors could be further stratified based on the pretreatment status of exon 1 (Figure 4A). As shown above, ARF null lymphomas can arise with (ARF null1 ) or without (ARF null 1 ) exon 1 genomic sequences.
Remarkably, mice harboring ARF null1  tumors responded as poorly as those bearing lymphomas with engineered or spontaneous INK4a/ARF deletions (Figure 4A, see also Figure 3B). Moreover, mul- tiplex PCR analysis of lymphoma DNA isolated after two rounds of CTX therapy revealed that the majority had completely lost exon 2 (4 of 6 tested, Figure 4B, compare lane 2 to 3). Therefore, INK4a deletions provide a selec- tive advantage to tumor cells during chemotherapy.
That most ARF null1  lymphomas lost one copy of exon 2 during tumor development may have predisposed these tumors to loss of the other allele during CTX therapy (see Figure 3A). By contrast, mice harboring ARF null 1 lymphomas displayed a superb prognosis (p  0.046, compared to ARF null1 ), even superior to ctrls. (Figure 4A). One explanation for this is that ctrl. lymphomas comprise a heterogeneous group, including subsets acquiring INK4a/ARF deletions or p53 mutations (Eischen et al., 1999 Schmitt et al., 1999) that negatively bias their over- all response.
However, the ARF null group never con- tained tumors with p53 mutations (Eischen et al., 1999), and our data imply that those also retaining intact INK4a genes are invariably cured by CTX therapy.
Indeed, one of the two relapses occurring in the ARF null 1 subgroup displayed a homozygous deletion encompassing INK4a exon 2 (data not shown). Consequently, the majority of the relapses (5/7 tested) in the ARF null group could be linked to either a CTX-induced INK4a deletion or an INK4a/ARF codeletion. p53 mutations confer an advantage to tumor cells during CTX therapy, even when apoptosis is efficiently blocked (see Figure 2). To determine whether this is also true for the INK4a/ARF mutations, we transduced E - myc INK4a/ARF  hematopoietic stem cells with either MSCV or MSCV-bcl2, and allowed lymphomas to form in recipient mice.
MSCV-transduced lymphomas lost the wild-type INK4a/ARF allele during lymphoma expansion whereas the MSCV-bcl2 transduced lymphomas did not (Figure 4C, compare lanes 1 and 2). This demonstrates that disruption of apoptosis can substitute for INK4a ARF loss during lymphomagenesis, and provides addi- tional evidence that the cell-cycle inhibitor p16INK4a does not contribute to tumor suppression in this setting (Krim- penfort et al., 2001). INK4a/ARF  HSC-bcl2 cells were  Drug-Induced Senescence In Vivo 341 Figure 5. p16INK4a Expression in CTX-Treated Lymphomas Overexpressing Bcl2 (A) Ctrl.HSC-bcl2 lymphomas were retrans- planted into several recipients and harvested either untreated (ut) or seven days after CTX therapy (7d CTX as in Figure 2). p16INK4a pro- tein was detected by immunoblotting. p53 null-bcl2 and ARF null-bcl2 samples are shown for comparison, and wild-type (wt), INK4a/ARF  MEF serve as controls.

Note that the ARF null-bcl2 samples are not the same blot or exposure as the ctrlHSC-bcl2 lymphomas.
In a different ctrl.HSC-bcl2 lym- phoma pair, p16INK4a protein levels were de- tected by anti-p16INK4a immunoprecipitation (IP) preceding immunoblotting (right).

Whereas the untreated lympho- mas retained exon 2, the CTX-treated tumors did not (Figure 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the INK4a/ARF locus encodes a nonapoptotic activity that contributes to treatment sensitivity.
To further evaluate the impact of INK4a status on treatment responses, ARF null1  lymphomas were transduced with MSCV-bcl2 or MSCV-p16as, an INK4a- exon1 -specific antisense construct that effectively suppresses INK4a expression (Carnero et al., 2000) (see Supplemental Data). The transduced cells were trans- planted into several recipient animals each, and the re- sulting lymphomas were either harvested directly or after two rounds of CTX therapy.
Multiplex PCR analysis revealed that exon 2 was retained in untreated ARF null-bcl2 lymphomas but lost upon relapse (Figure 4C, compare lane 5 to 6). In contrast, exon 2 was retained in ARF null tumors expressing MSCV-p16as, even after CTX therapy (lane 7). Taken together, our data demon- strate that mutations targeting INK4a produce a selec- tive advantage during therapy, thereby contributing to both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance.
p16INK4a Is Activated Following Drug Treatment In Vivo The data described above demonstrate that INK4a gene status is an important determinant of treatment outcome in vivo. Interestingly, p16INK4a acts strictly to promote cell- cycle arrest (Sherr, 2001a), and its expression increases with delayed kinetics following DNA damage in vitro (Robles and Adami, 1998 Suzuki et al., 2001) To de- termine whether p16INK4a responds to drug treatment in vivo, p16INK4a levels were examined in transplanted ctrl.HSC-bcl2 lymphomas before and after CTX therapy.
As was observed for p53 (see Figure 2B), p16INK4a levels increased markedly by 7 days post-treatment.
This in- crease was observed by immunoblotting with or without prior anti-p16INK4a immunoprecipitation (Figure 5A), and by immunohistochemical staining of LN sections (Figure 5B). Importantly, ARF was not required for p16INK4a induc- tion, since CTX also induced p16INK4a in ARF null lympho- mas expressing Bcl2 (Figure 5A). Paradoxically, p16INK4a levels were extremely high in p53 null lymphomas over- expressing Bcl2, and these levels further increased in response to CTX (Figure 5A). Thus, p16INK4a is activated in response to CTX where, in the presence of p53, it potentiates treatment sensitivity.
Cooperation between p16INK4a and p53 The fact that p53 null lymphomas express high p16INK4a levels but proliferate suggests that p53 might contribute to p16INK4a action.
To test this directly, we reintroduced cDNAs encoding ARF or p16INK4a (MSCV-ARF and MSCV- p16, respectively) into INK4a/ARF null or p53 null lym- phomas by retroviral transduction. The coexpressed GFP was monitored by flow cytometry to identify the fraction of cells expressing ARF or p16INK4a (Figure 6A), and proper protein expression was confirmed by immu- noblotting (data not shown). Neither ARF nor p16INK4a could be efficiently expressed in INK4a/ARF null lym- phomas 48 hr after infection (Figures 6A and 6B). How- ever, consistent with ARF acting upstream of p53, a substantial fraction of p53 null lymphoma cells ex- pressed MSCV-ARF. Surprisingly, p53 null cells also tol- erated MSCV-p16 expression, suggesting that p53 loss reduces selective pressure to eliminate INK4a. The fact that high p16INK4a levels as occur following CTX treat- ment are inhibitory to INK4a/ARF null cells but not p53 null cells places p16INK4a either upstream of p53 or in a parallel pathway.
To further delineate the relationship between p53 and p16INK4a in treatment responses, we asked whether p53 inactivation would alleviate pressure to mutate INK4a ARF during CTX therapy, and vice versa.
Indeed, p53 null INK4a/ARF  lymphomas (generated by intercross- ing [Schmitt et al., 1999]) never displayed a treatment- induced loss of the remaining INK4a/ARF allele (0/5 tested Figure 6C). Conversely, p53 was never mutated in INK4a/ARF null lymphomas that received multiple rounds of CTX (0/6 tested). Hence, p53 and p16INK4a co-  Cell 342 Figure 6.
Cooperation Between p16INK4a and p53 (A) Primary lymphomas were infected with MSCV, MSCV-ARF or MSCV-p16 which each co-encode GFP on a bicistronic message, thus allowing measurement of the fraction of infected cells by fluorescence.

Conversely, no p53 mu- tations were detected by RT-PCR sequenc- ing in repeatedly CTX-treated INK4a/ARF null lymphomas (data not shown). operate during treatment responses, apparently by en- gaging a program of prolonged cell-cycle arrest.
Chemotherapy Induces Premature Senescence In Vivo The cytostasis provoked by CTX is reminiscent of cellu- lar senescence.
This program, initially linked to the repli- cative aging of human fibroblasts in culture (Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961), is considered permanent and is characterized by specific changes including upregula- tion or the PML gene product, and the accumulation of a senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA- -gal) activity (Campisi, 2001). Although replicative senes- cence is triggered by telomere malfunction, a similar endpoint can be produced acutely in response to acti- vated oncogenes, oxidative stress, radiation, and cer- tain chemotherapeutic drugs (Chang et al., 1999 Di Leo- nardo et al., 1994 Serrano et al., 1997). Whether cellular senescence occurs in vivo is controversial, but SA- -gal-positive cells accumulate in older individuals (Di- mri et al., 1995). Most importantly, however, the program is controlled by the p53 and p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathways (Campisi, 2001). To determine whether CTX-induced cytostasis has features of cellular senescence, we examined SA- -gal activity in ctrl.HSC-bcl2 lymphomas.
These lymphomas were chosen because they respond to CTX by a cell- cycle arrest involving p53 and p16INK4a (see above). Indi- vidual samples were transplanted into several recipients each, and SA- -gal activity was examined in lymphoma sections at various times post-treatment.
SA- -gal ac- tivity was not detected in untreated lymphomas, but progressively accumulated between 1 and 2 days post- therapy (data not shown), achieving extremely high lev- els within 7 days (Figure 7A). These tumors also upregu- lated PML, an independent senescence marker (data not shown). In contrast, p53 null-bcl2 lymphomas remained negative for SA- -gal activity.
Also, ARF null-bcl2 (Fig- ure 5A) accumulated SA- -gal activity in response to CTX, whereas INK4a/ARF null-bcl2 lymphomas did not (Figure 7B). Hence, loss of either p53 or INK4a genes disabled premature senescence provoked by CTX. These findings demonstrate that the outcome of cancer therapy can be linked to a drug-inducible senescence program controlled by p53 and p16INK4a. Discussion Cyclophosphamide has been successfully used to treat many human malignancies.
Although CTX is not subject to resistance mechanisms involving enhanced drug ef- flux, many human tumors respond poorly or become resistant to this agent.
We used a unique murine lym- phoma model to show that the anti-tumor activity of CTX depends on its ability to induce both apoptosis and senescence.
Tumors lacking both programs rapidly progress to a lethal stage, suggesting that post-damage responses are almost completely responsible for CTX action.
Together, our results establish a paradigm for understanding drug action, as well as the interconnec- tions between tumorigenesis and drug resistance.
This paradigm will undoubtedly apply to other conventional anticancer agents, and perhaps many targeted thera- peutics. Senescence Contributes to Treatment Outcome Our study provides direct evidence that cellular senes- cence can be induced following chemotherapy in vivo,  Drug-Induced Senescence In Vivo 343 Figure 7.
Cellular Senescence and Cancer Therapy In Vivo (A) Matched pairs (untreated versus seven days post CTX therapy) of ctrl.HSC-bcl2 and p53 null-bcl2 lymphoma sections were compared for senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA- -gal) activity in situ (low power field). (B) Detection of SA- -gal activity in matched pairs of untreated versus CTX-treated ARF null-bcl2 and INK4/ARF null-bcl2 lympho- mas in situ. As in (A), experiments were conducted at least in dupli- cate using separate primary lymphomas.
(C) Model of therapy-induced senescence controlled by p16INK4a and p53. CTX, like many other conventional anticancer agents, causes DNA damage which activates p53 through an ARF-independent mechanism.
Block of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways by Bcl2 uncovers senescence as a drug-induced re- sponse program.
Senescence is disrupted in the context of p53 or INK4a/ARF loss, whereas ARF deficiency alone is not sufficient to disable senescence.
p16INK4a, like p53, can be induced by DNA damaging treatment and probably cooperates with p53 in a common arrest program.
leading to an anti-tumor effect.
In fibroblasts and epithe- lial cells, senescence is controlled by the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways, although the contribution of each pathway to the program depends on species and cell type (e.g., Randle et al., 2001). Cell-cycle arrest is considered permanent, and is accompanied by changes in gene expression and upregulation of SA- -gal activity.
Here, drug-induced arrest was accompa- increases in p53, p16INK4a (an Rb nied by substantial regulator linked exclusively to senescence), PML, and SA- -gal activity (Figures 2, 5, and 7). Disruption of either p53 or INK4a disabled the arrest program, prevented SA- -gal accumulation, and acquired loss of either gene often accompanied progression of once dormant tu- mors to a terminal stage (Figures 2, 5, and 7). The latter observation is consistent with the possibility that CTX- induced cytostasis is stable, and its escape requires rare pre-existing mutations that disable the program.
Importantly, the senescence program contributed to treatment outcome, since mice harboring tumors capa- ble of senescence but not apoptosis had a substantially better post-therapy prognosis than those harboring tu- mors with defects in both processes (Figures 1 and 3). Cellular senescence may parallel apoptosis as a global response to stress.
Indeed, we see that both apoptosis and senescence contribute to drug action, and that loss of either process promotes treatment fail- ure. Interestingly, certain agents that trigger apoptosis in one cell type induce senescence in another, and p53 and the INK4a/ARF locus encode important regulators of both processes.
Why some cells undergo apoptosis while others senesce is not known, but we note that drug-induced senescence is most pronounced in the presence of an apoptotic block.
This suggests that se- nescence can serve as a backup to apoptosis, and may explain the inability of Bcl2 to enhance clonogenic survival following drug treatment in vitro (Brown and Wouters, 1999). This backup may be particularly impor- tant in cell types not naturally prone to apoptosis or in solid cancers that have acquired an apoptotic block during the course of tumor evolution.
p53 Action in Mediating Treatment Responses Our results clarify the relationship between p53 and treatment sensitivity.
Anticancer agents can activate p53 to promote apoptosis, implying that apoptotic de- fects contribute to the poor outcome of patients harbor- ing p53 mutant tumors.
However, these results do not preclude the possibility that additional p53 activities contribute to drug action.
Indeed, ctrl. lymphomas in which apoptosis is disrupted downstream of p53 re- spond significantly better to therapy than p53 null tu- mors (Figure 1). These ctrl.HSC-bcl2 tumors do not prolif- erate and express high p53 levels following therapy by contrast, p53 null tumors (irrespective of their Bcl2 status) rapidly progress to a terminal stage.
Therefore, the impact of p53 on drug action reflects the combined effects of apoptosis and cellular senescence.
Yet other p53 functions may contribute to drug action in some settings (Bearss et al., 2000 Bunz et al., 1999). Loss of p53 function also accelerates tumorigenesis. We recently demonstrated that apoptosis is the only p53 effector function that suppresses myc-induced lym-  Cell 344 phomagenesis (Schmitt et al., 2002). Hence, Bcl2 over- expression in progenitor cells produces lymphomas that are phenotypically identical to p53 mutant tumors but retain functional p53. Nevertheless, the p53 mutant tu- mors, but not those overexpressing Bcl2, display check- point defects and aneuploidy, implying that these prop- erties are byproducts of p53 loss.
As shown here, another of these byproducts defects in cellular senes- cence supplies an additional capability to a tumor that is revealed only under therapy.
This capability is not conferred to control E -myc lymphomas overexpress- ing Bcl2, despite their equally aggressive pre-treatment behavior.
Similarly, ARF loss completely disables p53 during lymphomagenesis, yet allows p53 activation dur- ing therapy (see Figure 7C). Consequently, ARF null tu- mors respond better to chemotherapy than p53 null tu- mors (Figures 1 and 3). Therefore, the precise way in which the p53 pathway is disabled during tumorigenesis can give rise to heterogeneity in treatment responses.
INK4a/ARF Locus and Cancer Therapy Our data provide the first demonstration that p16INK4a contributes to treatment outcome in vivo, and imply that this reflects its pro-senescence activity.
First, tumors with engineered or spontaneous mutations disrupting both INK4a and ARF are less responsive than those harboring ARF mutations alone (Figures 3 and 4). Sec- ond, ARF null tumors often acquire INK4a deletions upon tumor relapse, and antisense INK4a-exon 1 can pre- vent treatment-induced INK4a loss (Figure 4). Third, cy- tostatic tumors retaining INK4a and overexpressing Bcl2 display high levels of p16INK4a post-therapy (Figures 5). Finally, ARF null tumors retaining INK4a have elevated SA- -gal activity post-therapy while INK4a/ARF null tu- mors do not (Figure 7). Still, while the evidence for p16INK4a involvement in treatment responses is compel- ling, it does not rule out a role for ARF in some settings (see Supplemental Data available online at http://www. cell.com/cgi/content/full/109/3/335/DC1). As p16INK4a is more strongly associated with senescence in human cells (Sherr and DePinho, 2000), the senescence pro- gram it controls may be even more important for drug action in patients.
p16INK4a probably promotes senescence by regulating the Rb pathway.
In fact, E -myc lymphomas arising in Rb  mice respond more poorly than ctrl. lymphomas (C.A.S. and S.W.L., unpublished). However, in E -myc lymphomas, p16INK4a action also depends on the pres- ence of wild-type p53. p53 null tumors proliferate de- spite high levels of endogenous p16INK4a, and enforced p16INK4a expression has little anti-proliferative effect (Fig- ures 5 and 6 see also Bardeesy et al., 2001). It is unlikely that p16INK4a induces cell-cycle arrest through the p53 pathway rather, we suspect that these molecules coop- erate such that intact p53 function makes the cell per- missive for the p16INK4a effect (Figure 7C). Interestingly, p53 initiates, but does not maintain, senescence in mu- rine fibroblasts (Ferbeyre et al., 2002), and it is possible that p16INK4a contributes to the maintenance process.
The way in which the INK4a/ARF locus is mutated during tumor development produces heterogeneity in treatment responses.
ARF mutations promote lympho- magenesis, whereas INK4a mutations (alone or in com- bination with ARF) have no additional impact (see Sherr, 2001b and Supplemental Data at above URL). Neverthe- less, owing to their proximity, ⵑ25% of E -myc lympho- mas acquire spontaneous mutations that disable both genes here, INK4a loss is a byproduct of ARF muta- tions. This proximity also allows mutations targeting one gene (ARF) during tumor development to facilitate loss of the other gene (INK4a) under therapy (Figure 4). Hence, the precise way in which ARF is mutated during lymphomagenesis has a profound impact on treatment outcome mice harboring tumors that have disrupted both genes have a worse prognosis than those with tumors lacking ARF alone.
Mouse Models as Test Systems to Study Drug Action The E -myc model provides a unique setting to study drug action (Schmitt et al., 2000a). In this study, we introduced transgenes into hematopoietic stem cells from different genetic backgrounds to rapidly produce tumors with compound genetic lesions, and tagged lym- phoma cells with GFP to monitor treatment responses in vivo by fluorescence imaging.
These approaches al- lowed us to dissect the biologic and genetic determi- nants of drug action in a manner that would be impossi- ble using cell lines or in patients.
For example, this system allowed us to spatially and temporally monitor drug responses of individual primary lymphomas in the presence of different genetic lesions, and to study po- tential gene losses in untreated versus treated mice harboring the same malignancy.
While differences between mice and humans un- doubtedly exist, we believe that mouse models have enormous potential for evaluating drug action and pre- dicting treatment responses.
Accordingly, much like mice harboring ctrl.HSC-bcl2 lymphomas, chemotherapy achieves prolonged disease control in patients harbor- ing Bcl2 overexpressing follicular lymphomas, yet these patients eventually enter a progressive clinical course that is associated with acquired p53 or INK4a/ARF muta- tions (Elenitoba-Johnson et al., 1998 Sander et al., 1993). Similarly, INK4a lesions correlate with relapses in Non-Hodgkin s lymphomas that lacked INK4a abnor- malities at diagnosis (Maloney et al., 1999). Links between Cancer Genetics and Cancer Therapy The fact that anticancer agents can rely on pathways that naturally suppress tumorigenesis provides a link between cancer genetics and cancer therapy (John- stone et al., 2002). For example, apoptosis reveals a brake against tumor development and contributes to the action of anticancer agents hence, disruption of apoptosis during tumor development can simultane- ously select for drug resistant cells (Schmitt et al., 1999). This observation provides one explanation for intrinsic drug resistance i.e., resistance with no preceding drug exposure.
In this study, we identify an unexpected twist to this relationship.
We see that byproducts of tumor development i.e., genetic changes not selected for during tumor evolution can give rise to acquired capa- bilities that become relevant only under therapy.
This may be because the different components of the tumor  Drug-Induced Senescence In Vivo 345 suppressor network play distinct roles during tumor de- velopment and therapy (e.g., p53), or because the physi- cal arrangement of certain genes increases the probabil- ity that some mutations occur together (e.g., INK4a/ARF locus). In either case, this gives rise to heterogeneity in treatment responses that ultimately translate into differ- ent prognoses.
The E -myc model is remarkably simple.
Each tumor analyzed was initiated by the same oncogene (myc), arose in the same strain (C57BL/6), and was treated with the same drug (CTX). Yet, these tumors displayed an extraordinary heterogeneity in treatment responses, ranging from cure to progression under therapy de- pending on their genotype. Given the complexities of human oncology, it is no wonder that treatment re- sponses are remarkably variable and difficult to predict.
Undoubtedly this inherent variability will remain a prob- lem, even as we enter the age of targeted therapeutics.
Still, our study provides a new paradigm to understand drug action and inherent variations in treatment sensitiv- ity, and provides support for the view that tumor geno- type is the most important determinant of treatment outcome.
These principles, when applied to human tu- mors, provide a strong rationale for individualized can- cer therapy based on knowledge of drug action and tumor genotype. Experimental Procedures Generation of Genetically Defined Lymphomas Lymphomas harboring loss-of-function lesions were produced by intercrossing E -myc transgenic mice with p53  , ARF  ( exon1 ), or INK4a/ARF  ( exon2/3) mice, all in the C57BL/6 background.
Genotype and tumor onset were monitored as de- scribed (Schmitt et al., 1999). Lymphomas were resected from tu- mor-bearing mice and either snap frozen, formalin fixed, or pro- cessed to single cell suspensions and transplanted into syngeneic recipient mice (Schmitt et al., 1999), or placed in short-term culture for retroviral infection.
Introduction of dominant activities into estab- lished lymphomas or E -myc-derived HSC was conducted as de- scribed in detail elsewhere (Schmitt et al., 2000b, 2002). Infected lymphomas or HSC were immediately transplanted into normal or lethally irradiated syngenic recipients, respectively, and lymphoma formation was monitored.
All retroviruses were MSCV-IRES-GFP- based vectors (MSCV) containing murine cDNAs such as bcl2 (MSCV-bcl2), p16INK4a (MSCV-p16), ARF (MSCV-ARF), the cDNA of a murine dominant-negative caspase 9 (MSCV-C9DN) (Schmitt et al., 2002), and a p16INK4a-exon 1 antisense fragment (MSCV-p16as) (Carnero et al., 2000). Monitoring Treatment Responses In Vivo Individual lymphomas were propagated in one or two recipient ani- mals each and treated with a single dose of either cyclophospha- mide (CTX [Sigma], 300 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally) or total body -irradiation (6 Gy) when LN enlargements reached about 5 mm (longest diameter, well-palpable ). Trials examining treatment responses of matched pairs are based on identical aliquots of individual primary lymphomas transduced with different transgenes (Schmitt and Lowe, 2001). Tumor-free survival was measured as the time between treatment (if achieving a remission within 6 days) and relapse, which is defined as recurrence of a well-palpable LN enlargement within 100 days after therapy (Schmitt et al., 2000a). Overall survival reflects the time between treatment and unex- pected death or a terminal disease stage.
Statistical comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves is based on the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
In some animals, fluorescence-based whole-body imaging was used to monitor treatment responses of GFP-tagged lymphomas (Schmitt et al., 2002 Yang et al., 2000). Monitoring Treatment Responses In Situ and Ex Vivo Measurement of apoptosis in situ and ex vivo was as described (Schmitt et al., 1999). For analysis of cell proliferation in vivo, primary lymphomas were retransplanted into several animals each.
Upon lymphoma formation, one tumor-bearing animal was left untreated while the others received CTX, and the tumors were resected 7 days later.
In some cases, 5-bromo-2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU, 100 mg/kg supplemented with 5-fluoro-2 -deoxyuridine) was intraperitoneally administered 6 hr before lymphomas were harvested.
BrdU was subsequently detected in paraffin-embedded 7 m sections using an anti-BrdU antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ki-67 and BrdU were detected by immunohistochemistry using specific anti- bodies (anti-Ki67 [Dianova, Germany], 1:50 dilution ImmunoCruz anti-p16INK4a system, Santa Cruz). SA- -gal activity was assessed as described (Dimri et al., 1995) in 12 m cryosections derived from treated and untreated animals.
Staining was for 12 16 hr at 37 C. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies directed against p53 (CM5, Novocastra, 1:2000 dilution), Bcl2 (13456E, PharMingen, 1:750), ARF (NB200-106, Novus, 1:1000), p16INK4a (M-156, Santa Cruz, 1:500), and -Tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma, 1:2000) as a loading control (Schmitt et al., 1999). For p16INK4a immunoprecipitation, 500 g of protein lysates were incubated with a 1:40 dilution of M-156 at 4 C for 3 hr.
Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting was carried out as described using a 15%-SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immu- noblotting with M-156 (de Stanchina et al., 1998). Mutational Analysis Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the p53 locus was detected by allele-specific PCR (Schmitt et al., 1999). Mutational analysis of the p53 gene was carried out using RT-PCR products as described (Schmitt et al., 1999). Gross deletions of the INK4a/ARF locus were detected by multiplex PCR analysis of genomic DNA using exon- specific primers for exons 1 , 1 , and 2 as well as for neomycin and -actin as controls.
Primer sequences and exact PCR conditions are available upon request.
Southern blots were performed using equal aliquots (10 g) of BamHI-digested lymphoma DNA samples that were separated on a 0.7% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane.
After hybridization with a 32P-labeled exon 2 probe, spe- cific signals were scanned and quantified using NIH image 1.61 software.
