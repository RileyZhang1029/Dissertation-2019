Protein purification and crystallization 

The rat NR2A S1S2 ligand-binding core contains residues P401-R539 (S1) and Q661-

N802 (S2) connected by a Gly-Thr linker. NR2A S1S2 was expressed and purified as 
for rat NR1 S1S21 except that 0.5% CHAPS and 250 mM NaCl were included in the Ni-
NTA purification step and trypsin was used to cleave the polyhistidine tag. NR2A S1S2 
and NR1/NR2A S1S2 crystals were grown by vapour diffusion at 4oC. The NR2A S1S2 
crystals  were  grown  by  mixing  equal  volumes  of  protein  (5  mg  ml-1)  prepared  in  a 
buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM sodium glutamate, 

and reservoir solution containing 8-17% PEG8000, 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), and 200 

mM calcium acetate. The NR1/NR2A S1S2 crystals were made by mixing individually 
purified NR1 S1S2 and NR2A S1S2 in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio (6 mg ml-1 total) and 
by combining the protein mix with reservoir solution containing 10-16% PEG8000, 100 

mM HEPES (pH 7.0), and 100 mM calcium acetate in a 2:1 ratio.   The crystals were 

cryoprotected  by  soaking  in  the  reservoir  solution  supplemented  with  18%  glycerol.  

The bromide derivative was prepared by soaking the crystal in the cryobuffer with NaBr 

added to a final concentration of 0.5 M. 

 

Crosslinking 

The  mutants,  NR1  N521C  L777C  and  NR2A  E516C  L780C,  were  expressed  in 

Xenopus  oocytes  using  the  same  methods  that  were  employed  in  the  two-electrode 

voltage clamp experiments except that 5 ng of RNA was injected per oocyte.  After two 

days, the membrane fraction from ten oocytes was solubilized in a buffer containing 20 

mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  8.0),  50  mM  NaCl,  1%  β-dodecyl  maltoside,  1/1,000  volume  of 

protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide in a 100 µl volume. A 

2 

sample  amount  equivalent  to  one  oocyte  was  loaded  per  lane  in  SDS-PAGE  and 

subjected to the Western blot analysis using anti-NR1 (amino acids: 660-811) and anti-

NR2A (amino acids: 1253-1391, Chemicon) antibodies under reducing (100 mM DTT) 

and non-reducing conditions.   

 

Light scattering analysis 

A  Superdex  200  HR  (10/30)  column  was  coupled  to  the  light  scattering  system, 

refractive  index  (Wyatt  Technology),  and  UV  (Shimadzu)  detectors.  Light  scattering 

was measured using a linearly polarized GaAs laser at λ = 690 nm.  The system was 

equilibrated  with  a  buffer  containing  20  mM  sodium  phosphate  (pH  7.5),  150  mM 

NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM glycine, and 1 mM L-glutamate. All of the samples were 
concentrated to 0.8 mg ml-1 and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer as above. 
Light scattering data, collected from 57o to 126o by 9 detectors, were analyzed using the 
Debye  equation  with  an  assumption  that  a  value  of  dn/dc  (increment  of  refractive 
index/increment of protein concentration) is 0.187 ml g-1.   

 

Sedimentation velocity experiments 

Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-

I analytical ultracentrifuge with interference optics and sapphire windows. Prior to these 

runs, the wild-type proteins were prepared as described for the mutant proteins in the 

sedimentation  equilibrium  experiments.  Samples  were  loaded  into  two-sector,  12-mm 
charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces at 3 mg ml-1 and run at 42,000 rpm in an An50Ti rotor 
at  4ºC  until  all  of  the  material  had  completely  pelleted.    Interference  scans  were 

acquired at 4-min intervals with a 0.003-cm spacing and one replicate per point.  Data 

3 

were  analyzed  with  the  continuous  distribution  c(S)  Lamm  equation  implemented  in 
Sedfit2 using every other scan.

NR1  S1S2  (a),  NR2A  S1S2  (b),  and  an  equimolar  mixture  of  the  NR1/NR2A 
species  (c),  all at  3  mg  ml-1,  were  centrifuged at  42,000  rpm  and  at  4ºC.  For 
each sample, the four panels represent, from the top, experimental fringe units, 
residuals (in fringe units) from the continuous distribution c(S) Lamm equation 
model,  continuous  distribution  [c(M)]  of  the  sedimentation  coefficient,  and 
continuous distribution of the molecular weight. Scans were recorded at 4-min 

intervals,  but  in  the  uppermost  panels,  only  every  fourth  scan  is  shown  for 

clarity.  Note  the  single  major  peaks  at  1.82  S,  1.67  S,  and  1.81  S  in  the 

sedimentation  coefficient  distribution  for  NR1,  NR2A,  and  the  NR1/NR2A 

equimolar mixture, respectively. These values correspond to molecular weights 

2 

of  35.9,  34.4,  and  34.6  kDa,  all  of  which  are  within  7-8%  of  the  respective 

monomer sequence molecular weights.

dose  responses  for  the  double  cysteine  mutants  (NR1  N521C  L777C/NR2A

coexpressed  in  Xenopus  oocytes,  were  assessed  by  two-electrode  voltage 
clamp  at  -60  mV.  In  both  the  tyrosine  and  the  cysteine  mutants,  significant 
increases in the glycine and glutamate EC50 values were only observed with the 
M/M  combination  (filled  square),  whereas  significantly  less  or  no  effect  was 

observed  with  WT/WT  (circle),  WT/M  (triangle),  or  M/WT  (filled  diamond). 
Although  speculative,  we  suggest  that  this  increase  in  EC50  in  M/M  may 
represent  an  enhancement  of  negative  cooperativity  between  the  NR1  and 

NR2A  subunits  caused  by  a  stabilization  of  the  subunit  interface.  Error  bars 

represent  ±  s.d.  for  normalized  data  points  from  the  indicated  number  of

     aAll data were collected with the absorbance optical system at 280 nm. The global fit in WinNONLIN included three rotor speeds 
(13,000, 18,000, and 25,000 rpm) and three loading concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mg/ml).  
     bData were fit to one of three possible models: single species monomer, monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium with the monomer 
molecular mass fixed to the correct sequence mass, or a monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium with the monomer mass allowed to float as 
a separate variable. Alternative models, such as single species dimer, monomer ↔ dimer ↔ tetramer, and monomer ↔ tetramer 
were also explored, but none of these possibilities fit the sedimentation data well.

Three different combinations of wild-type (WT) and mutant (M) (NR1/2A = M/M, WT/M, and M/WT) 
are expressed for the tyrosine mutants (Tyr) and the cysteine mutants (Cys) in Xenopus oocytes and 
assayed  for  glutamate  or  glycine  dose-responses  in  the  presence  of  300  µM  glycine  or  glutamate, 
respectively.  The data points are fitted to the equation response = Emax(1+(EC50/[ligand])nH)-1 where 
Emax is the maximum response, EC50 is the half maximal response, [ligand] is the ligand concentrations, 
and nH is the Hill coefficient. Values are means ± s.d. from the indicated number of oocytes.

The NR1 Y535 mutants or wild-type expressed with wild-type NR2A in HEK293 cells 
are assessed with outside-out patch clamp at -70 mV holding potential. The outside-out 
patch  is  exposed  to  1  mM  glutamate  in  the  presence  of  0.1  mM  glycine  for  3  ms  and 
washed out with a buffer containing 0.1 mM glycine (Glutamate) or to 1 mM glycine in 
the presence of 0.1 mM glutamate for 3 ms and washed out with a buffer containing 0.1 
mM glutamate (Glycine).  Twenty to thirty traces are averaged per experiment and the 
current  decays  are  fitted  to  the  double  exponential  equation  described  in  “Methods.”  
Values are means ± s.d. from ten different patches. As previously noted, we too observed 
variation  in  deactivation  kinetics,  perhaps  due  to  variable  degrees  of  receptor 
phosphorylation1. Labeled by asterisks are the mean values that are significantly different 
from the wild-type response (p < 0.05).
