NF1/AC/cAMP signaling modulated mitochondrial respiration.
NF1 or rut mutants reduced NADH-linked and ADP-stimulated (state III) respiration without altering ADP-independent (state IV) respiration.
Expression of one copy of heat shock controlled Drosophila NF1 gene in hsNF1/+; NF1 P2 restored normal state III rate in NF1 P2 flies (*: P < 0.05, t-test).
NADH-linked respiration is driven by pyruvate and malate which reduce NAD+ to NADH as they are metabolized in the mitochondria.
NADH is reoxidized back to NAD+ by OXPHOS complex I, n = 4, mean SD, total 150 flies per experiment.
