Supplementary Fig. 2. NF1/AC/cAMP signaling modulated mitochondrial respiration. NF1  or rut  mutants reduced NADH-linked and 
ADP-stimulated (state III) respiration without altering ADP-independent (state IV) respiration. Expression of one copy of heat shock 
controlled Drosophila NF1  gene in hsNF1/+; NF1 P2   restored normal state III rate in NF1 P2  flies (*: P < 0.05, t-test). NADH-linked 
respiration is driven by pyruvate and malate which reduce NAD+ to NADH as they are metabolized in the mitochondria. NADH is 
reoxidized back to NAD+ by OXPHOS complex I, n = 4, mean Â± SD, total 150 flies per experiment.
