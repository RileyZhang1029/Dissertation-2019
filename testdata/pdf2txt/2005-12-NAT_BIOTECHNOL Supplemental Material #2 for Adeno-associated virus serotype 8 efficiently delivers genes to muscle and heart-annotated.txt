Supplementary Figure 2    Comparison of AAV2 and AAV8 in adult 

hamsters for systemic gene delivery. Fluorescent microscopy (10 seconds 

exposure) of cryosections of heart and muscles were taken, 4 months after 

i.v. injection of 8 × 1011 v.g. of dsAAV-CMV-GFP vectors in 6-week-old 

male F1B hamsters. Whole-body fluorescent photography of an 

AAV8-treated hamster also showed strong GFP expression in most of the 

skeletal muscles. Scale bar, 100 µm.
