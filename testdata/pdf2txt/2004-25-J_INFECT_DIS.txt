We conducted a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and antifungal activity
of adjuvant recombinant interferon (rIFN)–g1b in patients with acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome and
acute cryptococcal meningitis. Patients received 100 or 200 mg of rIFN-g1b or placebo, thrice weekly for 10
weeks, plus standard therapy with intravenous amphotericin B, with or without ﬂucytosine, followed by therapy
with ﬂuconazole. End points included conversion of cerebrospinal ﬂuid fungal cultures from positive to negative
at 2 weeks, resolution of symptoms, and survival. Among 75 patients, 2-week culture conversion occurred in
13% of placebo recipients, 36% of rIFN-g1b (100 mg) recipients, and 32% of rIFN-g1b (200 mg) recipients.
There was a trend toward improved combined mycologic and clinical success in rIFN-g1b recipients (26% vs.
8%;
). Therapy with rIFN-g1b was well tolerated, and there was no apparent inﬂuence on serial CD4
cell counts and human immunodeﬁciency virus load measurements. Adjunctive therapy with rIFN-g1b holds
promise for patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis and warrants further study.

Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the most common
causes of central nervous system (CNS) infection among
patients with HIV and is the most common cause of
fungal meningitis worldwide [1, 2]. Although the in-
cidence of cryptococcal meningitis has declined among
patients with AIDS in the developed world, because
of ready access to highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART), acute cryptococcal disease as a presenting
manifestation of HIV infection still occurs and can lead
to signiﬁcant morbidity, even with therapy [3, 4]. In
the developing world, cryptococcosis continues to cause
signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality and ranks among

the 3 most common opportunistic pathogens in HIV-
positive patients. Despite advances in antifungal ther-
apy, at least one-third of patients with cryptococcal
meningitis who receive appropriate antifungal therapy
will have mycologic and/or clinical failure, deﬁned as
persistently positive cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) cultures,
persistent clinical symptoms and signs, or death due to
the infection [5, 6]. New therapeutic approaches could
signiﬁcantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of this
potentially devastating infection.

Interferon (IFN)–g is an endogenous cytokine with
diverse biologically beneﬁcial properties, including im-
munomodulatory activities [7, 8] and enhancement of
Th1 responsiveness by stimulating several host effector
cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, NK cells, and
neutrophils [7–9]. IFN-g plays a key role in host defense
against fungal, viral, parasitic, mycobacterial, and cer-
tain intracellular bacterial microorganisms. IFN-g has
been effective as adjunctive therapy for patients with
refractory mycobacterial infections, including Hansen
disease [10, 11] and leishmaniasis [12, 13].

In 1990, recombinant IFN-g1b (rIFN-g1b; Actim-
mune; InterMune) was approved in the United States
for use in patients with chronic granulomatous disease,

to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections [14].
More recently, rIFN-g1b has been studied in vitro and in animal
models of cryptococcosis, as adjunctive therapy to conventional
antifungal agents, and has yielded promising results [15–18].
In addition, there have been anecdotal reports of efﬁcacy in
patients with invasive fungal infection [19–22]. On the basis
of these encouraging results, we conducted a phase 2 clinical
trial to determine the safety and clinical and mycologic activity
of subcutaneously (sc) administered rIFN-g1b, in conjunction
with standard antifungal therapy, for treatment of acute cryp-
tococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging pilot study in adult patients with acute cryptococcal
meningitis was conducted in 10 sites. Eight sites were in the
United States, and 2 were in Lima, Peru.

Eligibility.

Patients had to be at least 18 years old, be either
HIV positive or HIV negative, and have newly diagnosed or
relapsed cryptococcal meningitis. They could not have received
13 days of systemic antifungal therapy for the most recent
episode of meningitis, with a cumulative dose of 12.1 mg/kg
amphotericin B or 1200 mg of ﬂuconazole or itraconazole. To
be eligible for efﬁcacy analyses, patients had to have a CSF
culture positive for C. neoformans at entry to the study, have
received at least 1 dose of study medication, and had at least
1 postbaseline CSF fungal culture. Patients were excluded from
the study if they were in a coma, were pregnant or lactating
women, or had any of the following laboratory results: serum
creatinine level ⭓2 times the upper limit of normal; aspartate
transaminase, alanine transaminase, or alkaline phosphatase
level 15 times normal; total bilirubin level 12 times normal;
absolute neutrophil count !1000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin level
!7 g/dL; or platelet count !50,000 cells/mL. Patients were also
excluded if they had received chronic systemic glucocortico-
steroids or had been treated for a prior episode of cryptococ-
cosis within 30 days before enrollment. Signiﬁcant preexisting
rheumatologic, cardiac, pulmonary, CNS, or peripheral vascular
diseases were additional criteria for exclusion.

Objectives.

The primary objective of the present study was
to determine the rate of conversion of a CSF fungal culture
from positive to negative at week 2 in the 3 study arms. Sec-
ondary objectives were (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability
of a thrice-weekly, 10-week course of 100 or 200 mg of sc rIFN-
g1b, (2) to compare the rate of conversion of CSF fungal cul-
tures from positive to negative at weeks 1 and 10, and (3) to
assess the effects of therapy on relevant clinical parameters,
including resolution of fever, headache, meningeal signs, im-
provement in neurologic status, and survival. This pilot study
was not designed to provide a high probability of detecting

2186 • JID 2004:189 (15 June) • Pappas et al.

statistically signiﬁcant differences in mycologic or clinical efﬁ-
cacy between therapy arms, but rather to determine whether
there was a trend toward better outcome among rIFN-g1b re-
cipients, compared with placebo recipients. If a trend toward
better outcome was demonstrated among rIFN-g1b recipients,
then these data would be used to select the best dose (100 vs.
200 mg) for a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
with sufﬁcient power to determine a clinically important dif-
ference in outcome.

Experimental design.

Informed consent was obtained from
patients or their parents or guardians, and human-experi-
mentation guidelines of the US Department of Health and Hu-
man Services and those of the authors’ institutions were fol-
lowed in the conduct of this clinical research. After providing
written, informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to
receive placebo, 100 mg of rIFN-g1b, or 200 mg of rIFN-g, each
administered sc thrice weekly for 10 weeks (for a maximum of
30 doses). All patients also received standard antifungal therapy
for acute cryptococcal meningitis, which included intravenous
amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg daily), with or without oral ﬂu-
cytosine (100 mg/kg daily in 4 divided doses), both adminis-
tered for 14 days (induction therapy), followed by oral ﬂucon-
azole (400 mg daily for 8 weeks). Patients could continue
receiving induction therapy at the investigator’s discretion, as
clinically warranted. After 10 weeks of therapy, per protocol,
patients continued to receive ﬂuconazole (at least 200 mg daily).
Patients were stratiﬁed according to HIV status and CSF open-
ing pressure (⭐250 or 1250 mm of H2O).

Evaluations.

At screening or at baseline (before starting
any protocol therapy), a complete history was obtained, and
patients underwent physical examination; mental assessment
with the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE); functional
assessment with the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) eval-
uation; and lumbar puncture with culture of CSF and deter-
mination of opening pressure, cell count, protein, glucose, India
ink, fungal culture, and cryptococcal antigen (CrAg). Labora-
tory tests included blood and urine fungal cultures, routine
blood chemistry analyses, urinalysis, prothrombin time, HIV-
1 and -2 antibody tests, complete and differential blood cell
counts, HIV load measurement, and CD4 and CD8 cell counts.
Lumbar puncture and CSF assessments were repeated at weeks
1, 2, and 10 after enrollment; other clinical and laboratory
assessments were repeated at frequent intervals. Patients were
queried about adverse events at each visit and were followed-
up through 4 weeks after completion of therapy with the study
drug (total duration of study, 14 weeks). Important clinical
parameters evaluated included fever, headache, meningeal signs,
and neurologic ﬁndings, including MMSE. Patients were with-
drawn from the study for serious toxicity judged to be related
to the study medication, intercurrent illness that could affect
assessment of clinical status, a baseline CSF culture negative

pregnancy occurring during the therapy period.

Outcome measurements. Mycologic, clinical, and com-
bined outcomes were assessed in patients for whom data could
be evaluated. Mycologic success was deﬁned as a negative CSF
fungal culture at 2 weeks. Secondary measures of mycologic
success included rates of conversion of CSF fungal cultures at
weeks 1 and 10. Patients with missing CSF fungal culture results
were considered to have a positive culture if the most recent
culture was positive. Clinical success at 2 weeks was deﬁned as
stable or improved clinical and neurologic parameters, com-
pared with baseline values. Combined mycologic-clinical suc-
cess was deﬁned as a negative CSF fungal culture at 2 weeks
and clinical stability or improvement, compared with baseline
values, as described above. Patients with insufﬁcient clinical
data to determine outcome were considered to have experi-
enced therapy failure.
Statistical analyses.

The population analyzed for myco-
logic and clinical end points included patients who had a pos-
itive CSF fungal culture at baseline, had received at least 1 dose
of study medication, and had at least 1 postbaseline CSF fungal
culture during the 10-week therapy period. All patients ran-
domly assigned to therapy who received any study medication
and had at least 1 follow-up safety assessment were evaluated
for safety end points. Conversion of CSF fungal culture from
positive to negative and clinical status were analyzed by use of
the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test. CrAg titers in CSF were
assessed by analysis of covariance, using baseline values as co-
variates. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons,
and patients with missing CSF fungal culture results were con-
sidered to have experienced therapy failure.

RESULTS

Enrollment and demographics.
Seventy-nine patients were
randomized to the study. Three patients who did not receive any
study drug and 1 patient who had a negative baseline CSF fungal
culture were excluded from the safety and efﬁcacy analyses. Thus,
75 patients were analyzed for safety and clinical end points. Five
additional patients with no postbaseline CSF fungal cultures were
excluded from analyses of mycologic end points. Accordingly,
70 patients were analyzed for mycologic end points, including
57 men (81%) and 13 women (19%) (table 1). The mean age
of the patients was 34.7 years (range, 21–80 years); 6 patients
were white, 5 were black, and 59 were Hispanic. All patients were
HIV positive. Among the 70 patients with mycologic end points,
12 (17%) were enrolled at US sites, and 58 (83%) were enrolled
in Peru. In general, these 2 subpopulations were comparable with
respect to demographic characteristics.

Baseline clinical and laboratory ﬁndings.

At baseline,
most patients had clinical signs and symptoms of CNS cryp-

tococcosis, including headache (95%), fever (74%), and men-
ingismus (73%). The median MMSE score was 22 (maximum
score, 30), and the mean KPS score was 70 (maximum score,
100). Twenty-two patients (31%) had CSF opening pressures
1250 mm of H2O. Mean CSF protein, glucose, and white and
red blood cell counts were similar among the therapy groups.
All patients had positive CSF CrAg titers, with median base-
line titers of 1:4096, 1:2048, and 1:4096 in the placebo, rIFN-
g1b (100 mg), and rIFN-g1b (200 mg) therapy groups, respec-
tively. Blood and urine fungal cultures were positive for C.
neoformans in 59% and 56% of patients, respectively. At base-
line, the median CD4 cell count was 16 cells/mm3 (range, 2–
429 cells/mm3), and the median HIV load was 244,817 copies/
mL (range, 650 to 1750,000 copies/mL). Although the difference
was not statistically signiﬁcant, Peruvian patients tended to have
ﬁndings indicative of more-advanced cryptococcosis at initial
presentation, compared with their US counterparts: they had
higher median CSF CrAg titers (1:4096 vs. 1:1280) and higher
median CSF opening pressures (183 vs. 153 mm of H2O), and
a higher proportion of Peruvian patients had positive fungal
blood cultures (62% vs. 36%), positive urine cultures (66% vs.
33%), and greater frequency of headache (98% vs. 75%).

Study therapy.

Compliance with the study regimen was
excellent and was better among Peruvian patients (98% of doses
taken) than among US patients (83% of doses taken). Physi-
cian-directed dose modiﬁcations were necessary for 46% of US
patients and for 20% of Peruvian patients. Cumulative doses
of amphotericin B were similar in both geographic subgroups
(10.1 mg/kg for US patients and 9.7 mg/kg for Peruvian pa-
tients), as were median number of days receiving amphotericin
B (13 days [range, 7–40 days] for US patients and 15 days
[range, 3–22 days] for Peruvian patients). No Peruvian patients
received 5-ﬂucytosine, whereas all 12 US patients received con-
comitant therapy with 5-ﬂucytosine during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of
therapy. Exposure to ﬂuconazole varied among US and Peru-
vian patients, but most patients received 6 mg/kg/day (400 mg
daily for most adults). Compliance with the antifungal therapy
regimen was similar across the 3 therapy arms. No patient be-
gan receiving HAART during the ﬁrst 3 weeks of receiving the
study drug.

Mycologic and clinical outcome.

Among the 70 patients
with data for mycologic status, 23 were in the placebo group,
25 were in the rIFN-g1b (100 mg) group, and 22 were in the
rIFN-g1b (200 mg) group. CSF fungal cultures were negative
at 2 weeks in 13%, 36%, and 32% of patients in the placebo,
rIFN-g1b (100 mg), and rIFN-g1b (200 mg) groups, respectively,
with a trend toward more-rapid sterilization of CSF among
rIFN-g1b versus placebo recipients (placebo vs. rIFN-g1b [100
mg],
) (table
2). Among 58 Peruvian patients, who did not receive 5-ﬂu-
cytosine, CSF fungal cultures were negative at 2 weeks for 19%,

33%, and 32% of placebo, rIFN-g1b (100 mg), and rIFN-g1b
(200 mg) recipients, respectively. In the combined rIFN-g1b
therapy groups, CSF fungal cultures were negative at 2 weeks
for 16 (34%) of 47 patients, compared with 3 (13%) of 23
placebo recipients (
). Among US patients, 4 (33%) of
12 had documented CSF fungal culture conversion at 2 weeks,
compared with 15 (26%) of 58 Peruvian patients. CSF fungal
cultures were negative at 10 weeks for 51 (73%) of 70 patients.
CSF opening pressure decreased with therapy in all 3 cohorts,
and there were no differences between therapy groups.

P p .064

CSF CrAg titers were measured at baseline and during ther-
apy. The relative reduction in titer was assessed on the basis of
the mean fold-change in titer, compared with the baseline titer,
for patients for whom paired data were available. The change
in titer showed a trend toward a more-rapid decrease in rIFN-
g1b recipients, compared with placebo recipients: at 1 week,
there was a 5-fold decrease in CrAg titers among all groups; at
2 weeks, there was a 24-fold, 12-fold, and 8-fold decrease in
the rIFN-g1b (100 mg), rIFN-g1b (200 mg), and placebo groups,

respectively; at 10 weeks, there was a 69-fold, 54-fold, and 24-
fold decrease in the rIFN-g1b (100 mg), rIFN-g1b (200 mg),
and placebo groups, respectively.

There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences or meaningful
trends among the 3 study arms, with regard to resolution of
clinical signs or symptoms, when these variables were considered
individually. A global composite outcome measure (combined
mycologic-clinical end point) was analyzed, and these results are
shown in table 3. This analysis was performed among the 75
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and were
culture positive for C. neoformans at baseline. Patients with miss-
ing culture data were considered to have experienced therapy
failure. At week 2, 27% and 25% of the rIFN-g1b (100 mg) and
rIFN-g1b (200 mg) recipients, respectively, met the criteria for
combined mycologic-clinical success, compared with 8% of pla-
cebo recipients. At week 10, the combined response rates were
65%, 58%, and 48% in the rIFN-g1b (100 mg), rIFN-g1b (200
mg), and placebo groups, respectively.

doses across the groups). One or more adverse events judged
by the investigators to be therapy related were reported for 56%
of placebo recipients, 70% of rIFN-g1b (100 mg) recipients,
and 88% of rIFN-g1b (200 mg) recipients. The most common
therapy-associated adverse events were those known to occur
with administration of IFNs, such as fever, rigors, malaise, head-
ache, and fatigue, which tended to occur more commonly
among rIFN-g1b recipients than among placebo recipients (ta-
ble 4). Anemia and neutropenia occurred more commonly
among rIFN-g1b (200 mg) recipients. Eleven patients discon-
tinued study medication because of an adverse event, including
4, 5, and 2 in the placebo, rIFN-g1b (100 mg), and rIFN-g1b
(200 mg) groups, respectively. Eight of the 76 treated patients
died (2 in the placebo group and 3 in each of the rIFN-g1b
groups) 9–95 days after initiation of study therapy; an addi-
tional 6 patients died within 30 days after the end of the study
period (after 98 days).

Therapy with rIFN-g1b did not adversely affect key param-
eters of HIV infection. There was no signiﬁcant change in CD4
cell count or the CD4:CD8 ratio at week 10 (end of therapy).
Therapy with rIFN-g1b did not adversely inﬂuence HIV load.
Indeed, the mean HIV load decreased by 17% at 10 weeks,
compared with baseline, in the rIFN-g1b groups, whereas there

To our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst randomized,
controlled clinical trial to examine the use of rIFN-g1b as ad-
junctive therapy for a serious invasive fungal infection. Al-
though the number of patients in this pilot study was too small
to demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant difference in the pri-
mary efﬁcacy end point (i.e., clearance of C. neoformans from
CSF at 2 weeks), the results did show a trend toward more-
rapid sterilization of CSF in the rIFN-g1b recipients, compared
with placebo recipients. Furthermore, at the end of the study,
CSF CrAg titers had decreased by 69-fold and 54-fold in the
rIFN-g1b (100 mg) and rIFN-g1b (200 mg) recipients, respec-
tively, versus 24-fold in the placebo recipients.

There was no dose response of lower-dose versus higher-
dose rIFN-g1b, with respect to CSF fungal culture conversion
(36% in the 100 mg group and 32% in the 200 mg group). At
week 10, the culture conversion rate and survival were similar
across the 3 therapy groups. However, there was a trend toward
a greater proportion of patients showing improved combined
mycologic-clinical outcome at both weeks 2 and 10 in the rIFN-
g1b therapy arms, compared with the placebo arm.

The clinical signiﬁcance of early culture conversion among
patients with cryptococcosis and AIDS is not fully delineated,
but some investigators have observed that persistently positive
CSF fungal cultures at 2 weeks predict culture positivity at 10
weeks and poorer clinical outcome [6, 23]. Among HIV-negative
patients with CNS cryptococcosis, persistently positive CSF fun-
gal cultures are associated with a signiﬁcantly worse clinical out-

come [24, 25]. Thus, in both HIV-positive and -negative patients,
early aggressive therapy leading to more-rapid CSF fungal culture
conversion is prudent and could have a beneﬁcial effect on the
long-term clinical course of CNS cryptococcosis.

It is unclear why overall rates of culture negativity at 2 weeks
in the present study (13% for placebo, 36% for rIFN-g1b [100
mg], and 32% for rIFN-g1b [200 mg] recipients) were lower,
compared with results from other published clinical trials. Cul-
ture negativity rates of 51%–60% after 2 weeks of induction
therapy with amphotericin B, with or without ﬂucytosine, were
noted among US patients participating in a randomized trial
of therapy for AIDS-associated acute cryptococcal meningitis
[6]. In the present study, only 26% of Peruvian patients were
culture negative at 2 weeks, and all of these patients were treated
with amphotericin B alone. This low conversion rate could
reﬂect differences in therapeutic approach (i.e., no exposure to
5-ﬂucytosine). However, in the present study, only 33% of a
small number of US patients were culture negative at 2 weeks.
A more likely explanation is that Peruvian patients had more-
advanced cryptococcosis, as suggested by signiﬁcantly higher
CSF CrAg titers, twice the rate of cryptococcemia, higher initial
CSF opening pressures, and more-frequent headaches. Each of
these characteristics suggests more-advanced disease at the time
of presentation. Access to HAART in the 2 populations prob-
ably had no effect on overall mycologic and clinical outcome
in the present study, because patients began receiving HAART
only several weeks after initiation of study therapy, and there
were no observed differences in outcome between patients who
did and those who did not receive HAART during the study
period. Moreover, when assessed at 10 weeks, the Peruvian

patients showed responses to therapy that were comparable to
those expected for a US population.

rIFN-g1b was well tolerated and led to few dose-limiting
adverse events, consistent with the results of previous studies
[10, 11, 14]. Only 11 patients were withdrawn from the study
because of signiﬁcant adverse events, and those prematurely
withdrawn were distributed evenly among the 3 study arms.
The most commonly reported adverse events were fever, mal-
aise, myalgias, and a ﬂulike illness, each of which appeared to
increase in frequency with the higher dose of rIFN-g1b. He-
matologic disorders, especially anemia, were also more com-
mon in the rIFN-g1b (200 mg) group. Concerns about the
potential negative inﬂuence of rIFN-g1b on the clinical course
of HIV disease were not supported by evidence from the present
study; indeed, quantitative HIV loads were generally lower in
the rIFN-g recipients at 10 weeks, compared with baseline, and
total CD4 cell counts and CD4:CD8 ratios did not vary between
therapy groups. Efﬁcacy measures were similar between the 2
rIFN-g1b arms, but, because of the trend toward more adverse
events with the higher dose, 100 mg of rIFN-g1b appears to be
the most reasonable dose for further study.

Data from the present trial suggest that rIFN-g1b may induce
more-rapid early sterilization of CSF among patients with HIV-
associated cryptococcal meningitis and may result in better
combined mycologic and clinical outcome. rIFN-g1b is well
tolerated and usually not associated with dose-limiting toxicity
in this setting. No adverse events of therapy on key parame-
ters of HIV infection were seen. These data support the con-
cept that, in patients with invasive fungal infection, augmen-
tation of the host immune response through the administration
of adjunctive immunotherapy may have therapeutic potential.
This approach may be especially important as the population
of individuals at risk for invasive fungal infection expands to
include not only patients with AIDS but also patients with
hematologic malignancies, long-term glucocorticosteroid re-
cipients, and others with underlying disorders associated with
signiﬁcant immune dysfunction.
