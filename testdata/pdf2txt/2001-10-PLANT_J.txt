Summary

Arabidopsis copper chaperone (CCH) belongs to a family of eukaryotic proteins that participates in
intracellular copper homeostasis by delivering this metal to the secretory pathway. In this work we
show that the CCH protein is mainly located along the vascular bundles of senescing leaves and
petioles, as shown by tissue prints and immunohistochemical detection. CCH protein also accumulates
in stem sieve elements and is collected in phloem exudates. Accordingly, Arabidopsis CCH is the only
member of the metallochaperone family described to function intercellularly to date. Moreover, the CCH
protein remains stable when plants are subjected to excess copper that causes a rapid and speciﬁc
decrease in its mRNA. These facts point to a role for CCH in copper mobilization from decaying organs
towards reproductive structures, as a result of metalloprotein breakdown.

Introduction

Intracellular free copper levels must be tightly regulated
through homeostatic networks to ensure proper function
of key metalloproteins while avoiding toxic excess.
Complementation studies performed in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae indicate that similar copper homeostatic path-
ways operate in all eukaryotes (for reviews see Koch et al.,
1997; Pen˜ a et al., 1999). In plants, copper homeostasis has
been brought to centre stage (Himelblau and Amasino,
2000) since ethylene perception has been shown to require
the proper ﬂow of copper through the secretory pathway
(Hirayama et al., 1999).

One of the copper network components in Arabidopsis
thaliana is the copper chaperone CCH, a member of an
emerging family of proteins that binds copper ion within
the cytosol and delivers it to the appropriate subcellular
destinations (for review, see Harrison et al., 2000). CCH
is the homologue of S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic copper
chaperone Antioxidant 1 (Atx1), that delivers Cu(I) to Ccc2,
a P-type ATPase that pumps the metal ion into the lumen
of a post-Golgi compartment
(Lin et al., 1997). The
Arabidopsis Ccc2 homologue, RAN1,
is involved in
ethylene signalling by transporting copper to the secretory
pathway (Hirayama et al., 1999; Woeste and Kieber, 2000),

ª 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd

where it is required for the creation of functional ethylene
receptors (Rodriguez et al., 1999). By analogy with the
homeostatic model from yeast, CCH could be involved in
directing Cu(I) to RAN1. Thus, ethylene receptors and other
secreted copper-binding proteins (e.g. extracellular multi-
copper oxidases) might also depend on the CCH/RAN1
copper route to acquire the copper cofactor.

In spite of the fact that these data indicate a role for CCH in
the homeostatic regulation of copper within plant cells,
little is known about the function that this protein might
have in the physiology and development of plants. Dealing
with this,
it has been recently demonstrated that CCH
mRNA is up-regulated during natural and ozone-acceler-
ated leaf senescence (Himelblau et al., 1998; Miller et al.,
1999), although the role of the copper chaperone during
these processes is unclear. Leaf senescence is characterized
by an orderly loss of structures and metabolic functions
collectively referred to as the senescence syndrome, a
progression of changes that ultimately lead to cell death
(Bleecker, 1998; Noode´ n and Guiamet, 1996; Weaver et al.,
1997). Leaf senescence involves degradation of lipids,
proteins and nucleic acids, and mobilization of the resulting
nutrients to other parts of the plant, where the vascular

system plays a pivotal role in the translocation of resources,
therefore contributing to growth of developing organs.

In this paper, we analyse some of the exclusive features
that the Arabidopsis copper chaperone CCH presents in
comparison to its homologues from all other organisms
studied, with the aim of gaining clues regarding the role of
copper chaperones in plants. Special attention has been
paid to the location and protein stability of this plant
metallochaperone and its implication in senescence.

Results

CCH accumulation and distribution during senescence

A plant-speciﬁc characteristic of copper homeostasis is
the increase in the mRNA levels during senescence of
several described homeostatic components such as
CCH (Himelblau et al., 1998) and RAN1 (Himelblau and
Amasino, 2000). We studied CCH protein accumulation
during natural leaf senescence in Arabidopsis by Western
blot analysis. Leaves at different stages of development
were chosen from the rosette by visual estimation, taking
into consideration the percentage of yellow leaf surface. In
mature green, 25%, 50% and 100% yellow senescing
leaves, both mRNA and protein followed the same accu-
mulation pattern: progressively rising from mature green
to 50% yellow leaves and decreasing thereafter (Figure
1a,b). In order to examine the spatial distribution of the
CCH protein within the leaf, tissue prints of senescing
rosette leaves at the above indicated stages were per-
formed. Figure 1(c) shows that CCH protein is mainly
restricted to the midrib vascular vein (class I vein) and to
the petiole of 50% yellow senescing leaves. A parallel
experiment where Rubisco antibodies were used to
develop leaf tissue prints, as a control for non-speciﬁc
protein release, did not show any preferential Rubisco
distribution in the midrib vein (result not shown).

Tissue location of CCH protein

In order to further address the question of cellular location
of
immunohisto-
chemical detection of CCH was carried out in transverse
sections of mature green and 50% yellow leaves.
Preimmune serum used as a control virtually gave no
signal both in green (Figure 2a) and in senescing (not
shown) leaf sections. Immunohistochemical labelling was
mainly detected in the class I and class II phloem veins
from both green leaves (Figure 2b) and the green portion
of 50% yellow leaves (Figure 2c), although the signal
dramatically increased in senescing leaves.

After a closer examination of the vascular bundles of
green leaves where CCH is mainly located, we observed
CCH protein accumulation in speciﬁc phloem cells (Figure

2e), whereas other cell types displayed undetectable labell-
ing (comparable to the preimmune control, Figure 2d). In
contrast, CCH accumulated at high levels all over the phloem
of senescing leaves (Figure 2f). In addition, immunoreactivity
was also observed in phloem-associated parenchyma cells
and in the apoplast regions surrounding phloem and xylem
elements (arrows in Figure 2f). Transverse sections of green
(Figure 2g) and senescing (Figure 2h) petioles displayed a
similar CCH distribution pattern.

In order to check phloem tissues other than leaf and
petiole, protein location studies were also undertaken in
stem transverse (Figure 3a,c,d) and longitudinal sections
(Figure 3e). After immunodetection, samples were stained
with DAPI for nuclei (Figure 3b,c,d,f) and with water blue
for callose detection (results not shown). The use of both
stains helped to discriminate between phloem companion
cells and sieve elements, revealing that accumulation of
the CCH protein occurs in stem sieve elements but not in
their associated companion cells.

Presence of the CCH protein in phloem exudates

CCH protein location along the phloem was further
assessed by Western blot analysis of leaf phloem exudates

that were obtained by incubating detached leaves in EDTA
solutions (Weibull et al., 1990). While the CCH protein
almost disappeared in the leaf after 48 h,
it became
detectable in the exudate, most likely due to unloading
of the phloem sap (Figure 4). In order to check if extensive
protein degradation is taking place in leaves under our
experimental conditions, or if exudates are contaminated
by non-phloem proteins, the same samples were also
analysed using a Rubisco antiserum. The Rubisco signal
was detected in detached leaves before and after incub-
ation, but was not detected in their exudates (Figure 4).

Effects of metal treatment on CCH expression and
protein stability

Another fact that differentiates the Arabidopsis metallo-
chaperone CCH is that its mRNA is down-regulated by
copper treatment (Himelblau et al., 1998), whereas homo-
logues in other organisms are not susceptible to copper
status, but rather subjected to iron-regulated gene expres-
sion (Lin et al., 1997). With the aim of checking whether the
CCH mRNA decay in plants is speciﬁcally regulated by
copper ions, the mRNA was quantiﬁed by Northern blot
analysis after 30 min treatment of whole plants with
different metals such as copper, iron, zinc and cadmium.
As shown in Figure 5(a), only copper treatment induced a
decrease in CCH mRNA.

ª Blackwell Science Ltd, The Plant Journal, (2001), 25, 521–528

Since copper levels have been shown to diminish during
senescence in Arabidopsis (Himelblau and Amasino, 2000)
and to further address if protein location is related to
copper status in the plant, Arabidopsis excised leaves were
treated with copper or with the copper chelator BCS. The
effectiveness of the treatments was assessed by measur-
ing the enzymatic activity of the copper-binding protein
ascorbate oxidase. When compared to the control, ascorb-
ate oxidase activity increased and decreased after copper
and BCS treatments, respectively (Figure 5b). Northern
and Western blots revealed that, under conditions where
CCH mRNA levels were undetectable and expression of
copper detoxifying systems such as metallothionein MT1a
was induced,
the amount of CCH protein remained
unaltered in Arabidopsis leaves (Figure 5c).

Discussion

The CCH gene appears to be in a single copy in the
Arabidopsis genome based on a database search. The CCH
protein is ubiquitously detected by Western blot through-
out all the plant organs analysed (results not shown),
which is in accordance with the gene transcription proﬁle
(Himelblau et al., 1998). The protein is also detected in leaf
protoplasts mainly obtained from mesophyll cells (results
not shown), in agreement with the intracellular house-
keeping function associated with metallochaperones

(Harrison et al., 2000). In this sense, the apparent absence
of signal in mesophyll cells, shown in Figures 2 and 3, can
be explained by the staining conditions used for micro-
scopy experiments that emphasize the high abundance of
CCH protein in sieve elements of green leaves and stems,
but do not allow detection of low levels of protein present
in other cells from the same sample.

Based on the CCH transcript and protein levels observed
during senescence (Figure 1a,b), CCH can be classiﬁed as a
senescence-associated gene (SAG), a group of diverse
genes that are mainly involved in salvage functions (Gan
and Amasino, 1997). However, since total protein decays
during senescence (Brady, 1988; Lohman et al., 1994), the
increase in relative abundance of the CCH protein could
simply reﬂect the maintenance of its levels during this
period. Nevertheless, considering results obtained from
tissue print experiments, it seems the concentration of
CCH protein indeed rises during senescence on a per leaf
area basis and in leaf vascular bundles (Figure 1c),
suggesting a role in nutrient transport. Our results show
that
the CCH protein belongs to the pool of soluble

polypeptides found in phloem sap, as it is detected by
Western blot analysis of Arabidopsis phloem exudates
(Figure 4), which further indicates that CCH could partici-
pate in long-distance copper transport in vascular plants.

feature of plant chaperones.

During sieve element differentiation, cells undergo a
selective degradation of internal structures. As a result,
sieve elements of ﬂowering plants loose their capacity for
transcription,
translation and protein maturation, and
depend upon associated companion cells for much of
their metabolic functions (Oparka and Turgeon, 1999;
Thompson and Schulz, 1999). Thus, like other proteins
found in sieve elements, CCH must be synthesized in
companion cells and imported to the sieve elements
through plasmodesmata connecting both cell types, and
once inside the sieve tube, the protein would ﬂow from
source to sink organs in an osmotically driven trans-
location stream (Fischer et al., 1992). Therefore, our results
demonstrate that CCH crosses the sieve element/com-
panion cell interface. Because in organisms other than
plants copper chaperones have been ascribed to function
exclusively inside the cells, this CCH intercellular trafﬁck-
ing between companion cells and sieve elements repre-
sents a differential
is
therefore tempting to speculate that the exclusive CCH
protein C-terminal
function
(Himelblau et al., 1998) could be involved in this transport.
It has been described that plants recycle metal ions from
senescing leaves to the growing organs (Drossopoulos
et al., 1994; Drossopoulos et al., 1996; Hocking, 1994; Mauk
and Noode´ n, 1992). Organic compounds such as nicotian-
amine and metal-binding proteins have been implicated in
the phloem-mediated copper redistribution, at least in
certain species (Garcı´a-Herna´ ndez et al., 1998; Miller et al.,
1999; Schmidke and Stephan, 1995; Stephan and Scholtz,
1993). In this sense, the Arabidopsis MT1a gene is highly
expressed in tissues involved in nutrient transport and its
mRNA has been located to the vascular bundle (Garcı´a-
Herna´ ndez et al., 1998). However, metallothioneins such as
MT1a presumably act as chelators that both bind copper in
a nonexchangeable form and are up-regulated by copper
once toxic metal concentrations are achieved inside the
cell (Zhou and Goldsbrough, 1994). On the contrary, CCH
expression is speciﬁcally repressed by copper (Figure 5)
and the CCH protein has the ability to bind and deliver
copper to a speciﬁc target, at least when produced in yeast
(Himelblau et al., 1998), thus indicating that MT1a and CCH
function might be different. It is possible that the high
levels of CCH in the phloem are necessary to compete with
other molecules for copper and to guarantee its delivery to
the secretory pathway, mediating the loading of extra-
cellular copper-requiring proteins en route from senescing
tissues to developing organs. Moreover, due to the
antioxidant role demonstrated for other non-plant CCH
homologues (Lin and Culotta, 1995; Portnoy et al., 1999)
and for CCH in yeast (Mira and Pen˜ arrubia, unpublished
results) a nonexcluding possibility is that CCH may
participate in the protection of the vascular system from
oxidant
toxic molecules produced during senescence,

preventing the damage of these structures and keeping
them functional for the proper and organized dismantling
of other cells in a senescing organ.

Experimental procedures

Plant growth conditions

We have found that CCH mRNA is speciﬁcally down-
regulated by copper when compared to treatments with
other metals (Figure 5a). After severe copper exposure of
detached leaves to 1 mM copper solutions, used by other
authors to check the molecular effects of copper on plants
(Mehta et al., 1992), whereas CCH mRNA levels are
undetectable and MT1a expression is already induced,
CCH protein levels remain constant
(Figure 5b). CCH
mRNA instability in Arabidopsis under copper treatment
suggests that its product is not required in the presence of
excess copper. However, the protein is stable under these
conditions that usually induce degradation of other
proteins such as Rubisco (Mehta et al., 1992). CCH protein
stability under copper-induced oxidative stress could be
based on its amino acid composition. Cysteine residues
have been proposed as the main targets of protein

residues and they are likely to be involved in copper
binding (Himelblau et al., 1998). This probably blocks the
sensitivity of the protein to environmental redox condi-
tions. Thus,
these apparently contradictory effects of
copper on CCH mRNA and protein levels could simply
reﬂect differences in stability of both molecules under
oxidative stress caused by copper excess and probably
indicate that under these conditions the CCH protein
present in cells is enough to perform its function.

et al.,

In this sense,

These results add new aspects to the discussion on the
role played by CCH during senescence. First, the stability
of CCH protein under enhanced oxidative conditions,
which also characterize senescence, would agree with
CCH operating during this physiological process.
Moreover, as senescence progresses, different leaf cells
would suffer from copper excess or defect, depending on
the path and kinetics that metal follows to exit these
organs.
the role of CCH remains still
unsolved, since CCH could participate either when copper
is abundant (as discussed above) or, on the other hand,
CCH could function by delivering copper, when scarce,
once the bulk of copper has left
to cells
that have to be functional in order to guarantee a thorough
leaf dismantling. Although further experimental support
would be necessary to explore this possibility,
the
decrease in CCH mRNA levels under copper excess
(Figure 5) seems to point to a preponderant role of CCH
under copper defect.

Brieﬂy, our results indicate a speciﬁc cell-to-cell role of
metallochaperones in plants and the implication of CCH in
phloem-mediated copper reallocation during senescence-
associated nutrient salvage.

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia (Col 0), were
grown in pots and covered with a clear plastic dome. The covered
pots were placed in a cold room at 4(cid:176)C for 2 days to synchronize
germination, and then moved to a growth cabinet at 23(cid:176)C with a
16 h photoperiod (65 mmol m–2 of cool-white ﬂuorescent light).
Plants were harvested after indicated times.

Metal and BCS treatments

For metal and bathocuproinedisulphonic acid (BCS, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) treatments, either plants or rosette leaves from
4- to 5-week-old Arabidopsis were excised and then immediately
submerged in 1 mM copper, iron, zinc or cadmium sulphates or
1 mM BCS solutions for 30 min or 18 h.

Exudate collection

To obtain phloem exudates, rosette leaves from 4- to 5-week-old
Arabidopsis were excised and their petioles immediately sub-
merged in 5 mM EDTA solution for 48 h, and placed in a moist
chamber as described elsewhere (Weibull et al., 1990).

Protein extraction, gel electrophoresis, Western blot
analysis, tissue prints and ascorbate oxidase
determinations

Plant tissue was extracted using 2 volumes of extraction buffer
[50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM PMSF,
2 g l–1 leupeptin, aprotinin]. After 1 min of vortexing followed by
centrifugation twice at 5000 g for 10 min, the total protein in the
supernatants was determined by Lowry’s method following the
protocol of Ausubel et al. (1995).

Ten mg of total protein were separated using reducing 14% SDS-
PAGE. Gels were either stained with Coomassie blue or electro-
blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for
immunodetection with antiserum against CCH recombinant
protein (H. Mira and L. Pen˜ arrubia, unpublished results) or
(Garcı´a-Ferris and
against Rubisco from Euglena gracilis
Moreno, 1994). Detection of antigen-antibody complexes was
performed using the ECL System (Amersham, Buckinghamshire,
UK). Tissue prints were performed on nitrocellulose membranes
and developed as Western immunoblots.

Ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) activity was measured on total
protein extracts from Arabidopsis leaves utilizing the protocol
from Diallinas et al. (1997).

RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis

Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis tissues as described by
Prescott and Martin (1987). RNA was quantiﬁed by UV spectro-
photometry and its integrity was visually assessed on ethidium
bromide-stained agarose gels. For RNA blots, 5 mg of total RNA
were separated by denaturing-agarose gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto a nylon membrane as described by Sambrook
et al. (1989). RNA blots were hybridized overnight at 65(cid:176)C with
[a-32P]dATP-labelled cDNA probes which were previously puriﬁed
in a Sephadex G-10 spin column (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala,

Immunohistochemistry

Arabidopsis leaves, petioles and stems were sectioned and
incubated overnight in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with paraform-
aldehide 4% (w/v). Samples were rinsed thoroughly in the same
buffer, dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared in xylene and
embedded in low temperature-melting paraplast wax (Sigma).
Ten-micron transverse or longitudinal sections of leaves, petioles
and stems, obtained with a rotating microtome, were mounted
onto slides using TESPA (Sigma) as the adhesive medium. After
de-waxing and hydrating the slides, the avidin-biotin-complex
(ABC) indirect immunoperoxidase detection of CCH was per-
formed. Where indicated, nuclear DNA was stained with 3 mg ml–1
4¢-6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI, Sigma) or with 0.01% aniline
blue prepared in 67 mM K2HPO4, pH 12 buffer.

Prior

to the immunohistochemical protocol, endogenous
peroxidase activity was inhibited by bathing the sections in 2%
H2O2 prepared in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (TBS) for
30 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated overnight
at 4(cid:176)C in a moist chamber with primary antibody (1 : 2000
dilution) followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h
with 1 : 200 diluted biotinylated IgG goat antirabbit (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA, USA). Immunodetection was carried out with the
avidin/biotin ABC (Vector Labs) system. The resulting peroxidase
label was histochemically developed with 0.025% (w/v) 3,3¢-
diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) and 0.01% H2O2 for 20–30 min
at room temperature. Finally, slides were dehydrated in graded
ethanol, cleared with xylene and coverslipped using Permount
(Fisher Scientiﬁc, NJ, USA). For comparison, all samples were
treated in parallel with the same solutions and reagents and
controls with preimmune serum were performed in consecutive
sections.
