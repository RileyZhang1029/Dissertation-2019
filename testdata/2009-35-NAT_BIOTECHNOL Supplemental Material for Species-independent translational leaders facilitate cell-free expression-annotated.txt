Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 4 Figure S3.
Analysis of translation efficiencies of EGFP encoding mRNA with different translation initiation sequences in coupled prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell-free expression systems.
(A) translation of EGFP encoding PCR products in coupled LTE and commercially available coupled cell-free translation systems.
The EGFP ORF was amplified by overlap-extension PCR to tag it with the indicated translational leaders at the 5 or 3 termini.
The leaders were chosen according to the instructions of the cell free system manufactures and are summarized in panel G. All translation reactions with the exception of RRL were incubated for 2 hours and changes in fluorescence were monitored using a fluorescent plate reader as described above.
During this period all systems except E. coli came to complete or near saturation.
The productive phase of the E. coli system was saturated after 4 hours resulting in total yield of approx.
200 g/ml Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 5 Optimization of cell-disruption procedure The ability of cell extracts to retain protein synthetic capacity is largely dependent on the approach chosen for cell disruption and the subsequent steps of the lysate fractionation 1 2.
We assumed that the better the organelles integrity was preserved during cell breakage the fewer of translation inhibitory factors would be released and less stress induced reactions develop.
We compared several methods of L.tarentolae homogenization by evaluating the activity of succinate-cytochrome C reductase complex as a measure of the integrity of outer mitochondrial membrane 3,4, 5.
(see panel E).
(B) comparison of the expression yields of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL) primed with EGFP PCR products bearing either a globin or (A)643HP leader.

(E) priming of E.coli cell-free system with the PCR products encoding for EGFP with the indicated translation leaders.

The latter results indicate that although SITS can substitute for the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes their activities are not additive.
(G) translational leaders used in this study for comparative analysis of the in vitro translation systems.
The BYDV and polyhidrin 3 UTRs are shown while in all other cases the 100 nt 3UTR was derived from pTUB-SITS-EGFP plasmid.

The lysate prepared by nitrogen cavitation produced similar results (not shown).

Reduction of exogenously provided oxidized form of cytochrome c by mitochondria sample leads to an increase in extinction at 550 nm.
The total amount of reductase activity was obtained by measuring the activity of the detergent treated samples.
The ratio of activities of detergent treated and untreated samples was used as a measure of membrane integrity.
Mitochondria samples obtained by nitrogen cavitation or by grinding of liquid N2 saturated frozen cells demonstrated the highest integrity (Fig.S5) as compared to the Figure S5.

(H) calibration of the assay with reduced and oxidized cytochrome c in the reaction buffer.
(I) 1 mM of detergent n dodecyl-D-maltoside negatively influenced the enzymes activity whereas 0.5 mM TritonX-100 had no influence on the reaction compared to the buffer control (10 m Tris pH 7.4).
Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 7 samples obtained by sonication, cell-disruption in Potter homogenizer, homogenization by glass-bead blender or disruption with the French press.
Microfluidic disruption yielded mitochondria with anomalously high apparent outer membrane integrity (Fig.S5B).
This is surprising considering the harshness of the procedure.
To assess mitochondria integrity using an alternative method we microscopically analyzed the shape of DAPI stained kinetoplast.
The kinetoplast is a large single mitochondria associated with the flagellum which appears as a single spot in intact cells.
We concluded on the basis of microscopic analysis shown in figure S5 that the cell lysates obtained by nitrogen cavitation contained the highest number of intact mitochondria while fluidizing resulted in their nearly complete destruction.
Thus nitrogen cavitation is believed to be the most suitable method for preparation of L. tarentolae lysate.

Translation of endogenous and exogenous mRNAs in L. tarentolae extract (LTE) Fig.S7 shows the incorporation of [14]Leu into the proteins expressed in LTE primed with endogenous mRNA.
Addition of purified homologous polyA mRNA fraction led to a further increase in [14]Leu incorporation, indicating that the system could initiate translation on the exogenously added templates.
To further confirm this we treated LTE with micrococcal nuclease to destroy all endogenous mRNAs.
Optimization of micrococcal nuclease concentration demonstrated that incubation with 4 unit/ml for 20 min.
at 20oC 2, 7 resulted in the lowest background and the highest translational activity of the extract.
Addition of homologous polyA RNA to the extract treated with micrococal nuclease resulted in reappearance of translation products.

Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 9 Anti-SL oligonucleotide mediated inhibition of translation of SL-bearing mRNAs in LTE Computer modeling of SL-region indicated the presence of a short imperfect hairpin structure in the middle of the sequence (Fig.S8A).
Nevertheless addition of the 35 nucleotide long anti-SL oligonucleotide (CAATAAAGTACAGAAACTGATACTTATATAGCGTT) efficiently suppressed the translation of L. tarentolae total mRNA in LTE and WGE systems at 20 M concentration (Fig.S8B).
Reduction in [14]Leu incorporation was observed independently of whether the RNA sample was pre-heated in the presence of the oligonucleotide to remove secondary structure prior to translation or not.
This indicates that the heteroduplex formation is favored over intermolecular interactions.
Neither the 14 nt anti-SL oligo nor 35nt oligonucleotides annealing within the EGFP Figure S8.

(B) SDS-PAGE analysis of [C14]Leu supplemented WGE primed simultaneously with two RNA templates: the EGFP-encoding RNA bearing obelin-derived 5'UTR and STNV-derived 3'UTRs, as well as RNA encoding for the viral capsid protein derived from brome mosaic virus (BVR).
The reaction was carried out in the presence of 100 ng/l final concentration of total L. tarentolae polyA RNA.
Prior to translation some of the RNA samples were heated to 68C and then cooled to 0C while the others were kept on ice prior to translation.
Positions of recombinant EGFP and BVR are indicated by the arrows.
Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 10 gene repressed the translation of endogenous mRNA at the concentrations up to 20 M. This suggests the direct mechanism of translation suppression is by interference with ribosomal interactions rather than by an RNAse H mediated process 8.
The anti-SL oligo treatment suppressed translation of both the endogenous and re-added mRNA indicating that it competed with pre-formed translation initiation complexes as well as inhibiting translational initiation (Fig.S8) Translation of heterologous RNAs in LTE mediated by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences of Leishmania viruses We initially attempted to use IRES sequences derived from the genome of L. guyanensis (IRESI) and L. major (IRESII) viruses IRESI L. guyanensis LRV1-4 virus (GenBank accession number U01899) 9 and IRESII (LRV2-1 L. major virus (GenBank accession number U32108) 10).
However none of these elements were able to efficiently initiate translation in vivo in L. tarentolae (not shown) or in vitro (Fig.S9A).
IRES-combinations mediated similar levels of expression in LTE and WGE (Fig.S9B).
We compared these leaders to an artificial 5UTR derived from the obelin-encoding gene of coral Obelia longissima, which in combination with 3UTR derived from the gene encoding the capsid protein of satellite tobacco necrosis virus, mediates efficient translation in the WGE system 11,12.

The samples were separated on 1% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Northern blot hybridization with DIG labeled EGFP probe.

Analysis of folding status of human RabGTPases translated in different cell free systems.
(A-N) Fifteen human RabGTPases were N-terminally fused with myc tag and SITS sequence and translated in LTE, E. coli, ICE, RRL and WGE cell-free systems.
The resulting translation mixtures were subjected to in vitro prenylation with biotingeranyl using recombinant Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGTase) and Rab Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 14 Escort Protein 1 (REP1).
The expression levels were quantified by blotting of the samples with anti-myc antibody.
The folding status of the GTPases was assessed by measuring the incorporation of biotin-geranyl into Rab GTPases as determined by blotting with streptavidin-HRP and the densitometry data was plotted as shown in the top panels.
Each reaction was performed in duplicate, either unsupplemented or supplemented with REP1 and BGPP in order to account for possible prenylation of recombinant Rabs with endogenous prenyltransferases in the eukaryotic lysates.
(O) Prenylaiton of cell-free lysates not primed with Rab genes in order to determine unspecific prenylation and the presence of the endogenous biotinylated proteins.
The star denotes the position of endogenous biotinylated E. coli proteins.
In the case of ICE lysate, prenylation of the endogenous pool of Rab GTPase was observed indicating the presence of background translation.
(P) Establishing the origin of the pool of unprenylated RabGTPases in the ICE system.
The ICE was incubated with or without puromycin (pur) and subjected to prenylation with BGPP.
The reduction of the signal in the presence of puromycin indicates background translation of endogenous mRNAs.
The bottom panel shows quantification of the protein-conjugated biotin-geranyl signal.

Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.1556 18 Supplementary methods PCR synthesis of SITS tagged ORFs Overlap extension (OE) PCR and two forward primer PCR methods were employed to synthesize ORFs bearing SITS sequence on the 5 end.
In all cases the PCR reaction mixtures contained 500 nM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 25 unit/ml of Taq DNA polymerase (Genecraft, Germany).
Splicing Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR was performed as descried in 14 with modifications.
The gene fragments for SOE PCR were generated in 20 cycles of PCR set up in a total volume of 50-100 l containing 500 nM of each primer.
The synthesized DNA products were resolved on 1% TAE agarose gel with ethidium bromide as staining agent and the DNA from respective bends was eluted with QIAQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
SOE PCR were set up in 20 l volume of reaction mixture contained 5 nM of gel purified 5 fragment and a slight excess (8 nM) of 3 fragment.
Thermal cycling included initial DNA denaturation step (2 min.
at 95C), 8 cycles of SOE (denaturation 1 min.
at 95C; annealing 3 min.
at 45 or 48C (depending on the sequence) ; 1 min.
elongation for every 1000 nt of fused gene at 72C).
Subsequently 10 l of SOE PCR mixture was mixed with 70 l of PCR mixture containing flanking primers for amplification of the fused gene and subjected to further 20 PCR cycles to obtain the final product (Fig.S14).
Two-forward-primer-PCR was used to introduce T7 promoter and short leader sequences into templates.
To achieve that an adapter oligonucleotide complementary to the gene of interest and containing 19 nucleotides of SITS sequence was used as a first forward primer.
The second forward primer encoded T7 promoter and a full length leader sequence annealing to the adapter oligonucleotide.
The PCR reaction mixture contained 50 nM adapter primer, 500 nM of second forward and 500 nM of the reverse primer (Fig.S14).
