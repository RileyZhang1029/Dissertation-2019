ABSTRACT
Mouse embryonic pluripotent stem cells can be obtained
from the inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage (embryonic
stem cells, ESCs) or from the late epiblast of postimplanta-
tion embryos (epiblast stem cells, EpiSCs). During normal
development, the transition between these two stages is
marked by major epigenetic and transcriptional changes
including DNA de novo methylation. These modiﬁcations
represent an epigenetic mark conserved in ESCs and
EpiSCs. Pluripotent ESCs derived from blastocysts gener-
ated by nuclear transfer (NT) have been shown to be cor-
rectly reprogrammed. However, NT embryos frequently
undergo abnormal development. In the present study, we
have examined whether pluripotent cells could be derived
from the epiblast of postimplantation NT embryos and
whether the reprogramming process would affect the epige-
netic changes occurring at this stage, which could explain

abnormal development of NT embryos. We showed that
EpiSCs could be derived with the same efﬁciency from NT
embryos and from their fertilized counterparts. However,
gene expression proﬁle analyses showed divergence between
fertilized- and nuclear transfer-EpiSCs with a surprising
bias in the distribution of the differentially expressed genes,
30% of them being localized on chromosome 11. A majority
of these genes were downregulated in NT-EpiSCs and
imprinted genes represented a signiﬁcant fraction of them.
Notably, analysis of the epigenetic status of a downregulated
imprinted gene in NT-EpiSCs revealed complete methyla-
tion of the two alleles. Therefore, EpiSCs derived from NT
embryos appear to be incorrectly reprogrammed, indicating
that abnormal epigenetic marks are imposed on cells in NT
embryos during the transition from early to late epiblast.

INTRODUCTION

Mouse embryonic pluripotent cells can be derived from the
early epiblast cells within the inner cell mass (ICM) at
the blastocyst stage (embryonic stem cells, ESCs) or from the

late epiblast of postimplantation embryo (epiblast stem cells
[1, 2], EpiSCs). Although these pluripotent stem cells share
the same core transcriptional network including the pluripo-
tency factors Oct3/4, Sox2, and Nanog, they differ not only
by their culture condition requirements but also by the extent
of their contribution to chimeras: only ESCs can integrate

Derivation of EpiSCs from Nuclear-Transfer Embryos

properly within the host blastocyst and contribute to the germ-
line [1, 2]. Moreover, their epigenetic status differs, reﬂecting
the modiﬁcations accompanying the transition from naı¨ve epi-
blast to advanced, pregastrulating epiblast [3, 4]. These modi-
ﬁcations include the de novo methylation of the genome and
the X-inactivation process [5–8].

several

Reprogramming somatic nuclear activity through nuclear
transfer (NT) has been shown to give rise to fertile adults. It
is commonly admitted that low efﬁciency of successful devel-
opment is correlated by incomplete or error-prone epigenetic
reprogramming. Indeed, chromatin modiﬁcations such as his-
tone marks and DNA methylation have been shown to be
affected after NT not only in early embryos but also in ani-
mals after birth [9–12]. However,
studies have
reported that ESCs derived from NT blastocysts (NT-ESCs)
are fully pluripotent and have a normal epigenetic status.
Moreover, they have been shown to be equivalent to their fer-
tilized (FT) counterparts for their transcriptome, proteome,
and miRNA proﬁles [13–15]. Strikingly, NT-ESCs are derived
from blastocysts which frequently exhibit abnormal features
in terms of both morphology [16] and transcriptional activities
[17]. Moreover, we have shown that defects present in the
ICM were mainly responsible for the loss of embryos at peri-
implantation stages [18]. In view of these results, the similar-
ity of NT-ESCs and FT-ESCs is intriguing and suggests either
that the defects in the NT-ICM do not affect derivation of ES
cells in vitro or that a normal pattern of gene expression is
acquired during the in vitro culture period required to estab-
lish ESC lines. Alternatively, but not exclusively, it can be
hypothesized that NT-ESCs might be derived from a subset
of correctly reprogrammed NT-ICM cells.

Furthermore, most of

the early postimplantation NT
embryos clearly exhibit abnormal developmental features, origi-
nating from defects in both the epiblast and the trophoblast [18,
19]. We therefore decided to derive and to study EpiSCs from
NT embryos to examine whether the reprogramming processes
affect the maintenance of pluripotency in the postimplantation
epiblast and the building of the epigenetic barrier separating
ESCs and EpiSCs. Our data show that NT-EpiSCs are transcrip-
tionally and epigenetically different from FT-EpiSCs. This is in
contrast to the results obtained with FT-ESCs versus NT-ESCs
and suggests that pluripotent cell
lines from NT embryos at
advanced developmental stages have kept the memory of epige-
netic alterations occurring during the in vivo establishment of the
epigenetic barrier in the epiblast around the implantation time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
A transgenic mouse line (C57Bl6/J) carrying the gene for green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the GOF18 frag-
ment of the Oct4 promoter was used. The genetic construction
was described elsewhere [20] and mice were kindly provided by
Professor Zhangjian (Institute of Genetics and Developmental
Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences).

For nuclear-transfer experiments, oocytes and cumulus donor
cells were retrieved from B6D2F1 or from Oct4-GFP B6D2F1 mice.
Controls were embryos that were fertilized in vivo (B6D2F1).

All animals were maintained in accordance with the guide-
lines for the care and use of laboratory animals established by the
Beijing Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer
Nuclear transfer of cumulus nuclei into enucleated oocytes was
performed as previously described [21]. Brieﬂy, embryos were

reconstructed by injection of cumulus nuclei
into enucleated
oocytes from superovulated females and then activated with
strontium in CZB medium. Embryos were transferred at the two-
cell stage into pseudo-pregnant ICR females.

Derivation and Culture of EpiSC Lines
EpiSC lines were derived as previously described [1]: epiblasts
from pre-streak/early-streak E7 NT or E6.5 control embryos were
cultured in completely deﬁned medium complemented with 20
ng/ml Activin A (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, http://www.
rndsystems.com; catalog no. 338-AC) and 12 ng/ml ﬁbroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2; R&D Systems; catalog no. 223-FB). Plu-
ripotent-looking colonies were mechanically picked and expanded
before routine passage with collagenase II
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com; catalog no. C6885). Dur-
ing picking and the ﬁrst rounds of passages, culture dishes were
coated with 10 ll/ml ﬁbronectin (Chemicon International, Teme-
cula, CA, http://www.chemicon.com; catalog no. FC-010) before
switching to fetal calf serum coating. All cell lines were used
between passages 10 and 20.

Immunohistochemistry
staining was performed according to
Alkaline phosphatase
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
the manufacturer’s
Switzerland,
no.
11681451001). For immunoﬂuorescence, outgrowths, and EpiSCs
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4C overnight. They were
then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room tem-
perature, before blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in phos-
phate buffered saline. Incubation was carried out overnight at 4C
with the following antibodies: goat a-Oct4 (monoclonal 1:100), rab-
bit a-Sox2 (monoclonal 1:500), and mouse a-SSEA-I (monoclonal
1:75) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA,
http://www.scbt.com); rabbit a-Nanog (monoclonal 1:100) was from
Chemicon International. Secondary antibodies (FITC or Cy5-conju-
gate from ZhongShan Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, PRC) were
used for detection as appropriate. Nuclei were counterstained with
propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). Observations were made with an
epiﬂuorescence microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland, http://
www.leica.com) or a LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Jena, Germany, http://www.zeiss.com).

Bisulﬁte Genomic Sequencing
DNA was extracted from cumulus cells, E13.5 fetuses, and EpiSC
lines. Bisulﬁte treatment was performed as previously described
[22]. Primers for Snrpn/Snurf and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) conditions used to amplify products from bisulﬁte-treated
DNA were described elsewhere [23]. The ampliﬁed region corre-
sponds to the DMR1 encompassing the transcription start site and
containing 16 CpG residues. Ampliﬁed products were sequenced
by Cogenics (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Takeley, United King-
dom, https://www.cogenicsonline.com)

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany,
http://www1.qiagen.com) with DNaseI
treatment and reverse-transcribed with superscript II reverse tran-
scriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, http://www.invitrogen.com).
FT- and NT-ESC samples were obtained from a previous study
[24]. PCR was done as previously described [1]. Real-time PCR
was run in triplicate on a Step One plus (Applied BioSystems,
Foster City, CA, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com) and expres-
sion data normalized by the expression level of b-Actin (Actb).
Primer pairs for quantitative RT-PCR were all from Primer Bank
(http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank):
(ID
15029532a1), Ndn (ID 31981598a1), Peg3 (ID 6561146a1), Krt19
(ID 6680606a1), and Gusb (ID 6754098a1) except for Actb (for-
ward: 50-GCTCTGGCTCCTAGCACCAT-30; reverse: 50-GCCAC

Mitotic Index Determination
FT and NT outgrowths were stained for Oct4 and counterstained
with propidium iodide. Optical sectioning was carried out using a
confocal microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss) and the num-
ber of mitotic ﬁgures was counted on each slice using ImageJ
software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/Java1.3.1_13). A total of 750-
1,000 cells across different optical sections were counted in each
sample.

5-Bromo-20-deoxy-uridine Incorporation Assay
Cell proliferation assays were carried out according to the manu-
facturer’s instruction (Roche Diagnostics; 5-Bromo-20-deoxyuri-
dine [BrdU] labeling kit, catalog no. 11 296 736 001). For each
cell line (passages 10-15), cells from three independent biological
repeats were labeled and about 250 cells counted in each.

Gene Expression Analysis Using Microarray
For each EpiSC line, total RNAs were extracted from two to
three independent biological repeats. For male and female pre-
streak embryos, total RNAs were extracted from 3 pools of 10
embryos, each of the same sex. Hybridizations were performed
using the Illumina array Mouse WG-6 V2.0 expression BeadChip.
Raw data were analyzed using BeadStudio v3 software (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, CA, http://www.illumina.com). Values were nor-
malized and log2 transformed under R software. To obtain the
list of differentially expressed probes, we used a Student’s t test
(limma R package, 2004) and p values were adjusted using the
Benjamini-Hochberg method for false discovery rate control [25].
Transcriptomic data are accessible in the Gene Expression Omni-
bus with the accession number GSE17402.

Embryoid Body Formation
Embryoid bodies (EBs) were produced as described previously
[1]. Brieﬂy, ﬂoating EpiSC clumps were cultured for 6 days in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum.
Resulting EBs were plated on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes and cul-
tured for 10 days.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 13.0. v2,
Kruskal-Wallis, and ANOVA tests were used when appropriate,
with a signiﬁcant value of p < .05.

FT- and NT-EpiSC Are Similar in Terms of Marker
Expression and In Vitro Differentiation
Pre-streak/early-streak NT embryos obtained from somatic
cell nuclear
(SCNT) were dissected at E7 and
grouped according to their morphological aspect (Fig. 1). The
different classes of morphology were previously deﬁned using
ESCs as donor nuclei [18]. With use of the same criteria, 16
SCNT embryos out of 38 (44%) exhibited morphology similar
to that of controls and belonged to the ‘‘normal’’ class. Nine-
teen percent of NT embryo epiblasts had a size inferior to
their extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) and this group was
deﬁned as ‘‘large extraembryonic ectoderm’’
(large ExE)
embryos. 19% of the epiblasts were more spherical than elon-
gated and wider than the ExE and were classed in the ‘‘round
shape’’ category. Finally, 17% of the NT embryos displayed a
very perturbed morphology with no clear distinction between
the embryonic and extraembryonic compartment and were
consequently considered as belonging to the ‘‘vesicular shape’’
category.

Epiblasts could be successfully isolated from all the dif-
ferent NT-embryo categories except for the vesicular shape
category. The resulting clump of cells was grown in a deﬁned
medium supplemented with Activin and FGF2 [1] until
it
formed an outgrowth from which pluripotent colonies were
identiﬁed using morphological criteria (tightly packed colo-
nies of smooth appearance, with large nuclei). These colonies
were picked and expanded in the same culture conditions.
After several rounds of mechanical passage, stable and pluri-
potent-looking cell lines were obtained with a similar efﬁ-
ciency from FT and NT embryos (Table 1). Both kinds of
cell lines were passaged every 2 or 3 days and were morpho-
logically similar (Fig. 2A).

When the last type of embryos (vesicular shape) was cul-
tured, they rarely formed an outgrowth and did not give rise
to any EpiSC line. Immunoﬂuorescence analysis indicated
that no cell of outgrowth from vesicular shape embryos
expressed Oct4, a key marker of pluripotency [26] (data not
shown).

Three FT-EpiSC lines (FT.1, FT.2, and FT.3) and three
NT-EpiSC lines
(NT.1 and NT.2 derived from normal
embryo, NT-LE derived from large ExE embryo) were
selected for further analyses. FT and NT lines expressed
markers of pluripotency including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and

(Fig. 2B, 2C and data not shown). RT-PCR analyses con-
ﬁrmed the expression of pluripotency markers and epiblast
markers such as FgF5 and Nodal in both FT- and NT-EpiSCs
(Fig. 2D). As expected, FT- and NT-EpiSCs did not express
the germ cell-speciﬁc marker Stella (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
these data indicate that FT- and NT-EpiSCs express markers
characterizing EpiSCs [1, 2] and thus validate their embryonic
identity.

Importantly, FT- and NT-EpiSCs were able to form EBs
that gave rise to various tissues, including ﬁbroblast-like cells,
liver-like cells, and beating cells once grown in adherent cul-
ture conditions (data not shown). Presence of derivatives of
the three primary germ layers was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR
analyses, showing that plated EBs from FT- and NT-EpiSCs
expressed markers

and endoderm differentiation (Gata6, Pdx1, and Foxa2; Fig.
2E). Together,
these results show that FT- and NT-EpiSC
lines are able to differentiate into derivatives of the three pri-
mary germ layers in vitro.

FT- and NT-EpiSC Lines Proliferate at the
Same Rate
Interestingly, we observed that the mitotic index of a large
proportion (41%) of epiblasts from postimplantation cloned
embryos signiﬁcantly differs from controls [18], suggesting
that NT- and FT-EpiSCs could have different rates of prolifer-
ation. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we used BrdU incorporation

Maruotti, Dai, Brochard et al.

747

assays to determine the cell proliferation in the different
EpiSC lines. After only 5 minutes of BrdU pulse, 70% of
cells were stained in FT and NT lines (supporting information
Fig. 1A, 1B), and after 1 hour of BrdU incubation, this per-
centage rose to 78%. Statistical comparison indicated no sig-
niﬁcant difference between rates of BrdU incorporation in
FT- and NT-EpiSC lines. Therefore, cell proliferation rates
are similar between FT- and NT-EpiSCs.

FT and NT Outgrowths Display a Similar Dynamic
Pattern of Oct4 Expression
The results described above suggested that the differences in
cell proliferation observed between FT and NT epiblasts in
vivo were lost in vitro. Therefore, we decided to examine
whether these difference were still present when pluripotent
primary colonies of EpiSCs were formed at the outgrowth
stage. Once plated on ﬁbronectin,
isolated epiblasts grew
actively and formed an outgrowth in which EpiSC pluripotent
primary colonies were easily recognized by their morphology.
Oct4 is a key marker of pluripotency [26] expressed in EpiSC
lines and lost upon their differentiation [1]. To follow the
dynamics of Oct4 expression pattern during the outgrowth
phase in FT- and NT-EpiSC line derivation, we used embryos
expressing the GFP under the control of the Oct4 promoter
[20]. During our observations, we noticed that Oct4-express-
ing cells always had pluripotent morphology, although the
contrary was not always true. Moreover, EpiSC lines were
derived only from GFP-positive colonies and never arose
from cells negative for Oct4 expression (data not shown).

Two patterns of Oct4 expression were observed (Fig. 3A,
3B) in FT and NT outgrowths: (i) From day 1 to days 3-4 of
in vitro culture, there was a progressive decrease of the Oct4-
expressing cell population, before its rise during the next 4-8
days, until Oct4-expressing colonies were large enough for
picking and subsequent EpiSC derivation. This pattern was
followed by 36% (4/11) and 44% (4/9) of FT and NT out-
growths, respectively. (ii) From day 1 to days 3-5 of in vitro
culture, the Oct4-expressing cell population progressively dis-
appeared and did not reappear. This happened in 64% (7/11)
of the FT outgrowths, versus 56% (5/9) for their NT counter-
parts. The same distribution within the two patterns was found
for the two types of outgrowths. Therefore, the derivation pro-
cess appears very similar for NT and FT epiblasts.

In Oct4-Expressing Areas, Cell Proliferation
Differences Between FT and NT Outgrowths
Fade Away During In Vitro Culture
To conﬁrm these observations, we performed immunostaining
analyses for the expression of Oct4 and compared the cell
proliferation in FT versus NT outgrowths. Since EpiSC lines
were derived from Oct4-positive primary colonies within the
outgrowths, we decided to deﬁne the proliferation rate of this
particular cell population. First, the Oct4 expression pattern
previously observed in FT and NT outgrowths with the Oct4-
GFP construct was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence after 24
hours, 4 days, and 10 days of in vitro culture (supporting in-
formation Fig. 2). Then we used mitotic index to assess cell
proliferation. Importantly, preliminary experiments with BrdU
were unsuccessful because of the limited penetration of BrdU
into the outgrowth inner cells. Two time points were chosen:
after 24 hours of in vitro culture, when the outgrowth was
mainly composed of Oct4-positive cells and has just started to
spread, and after 10 days, when Oct4-positive EpiSC primary
colonies were usually picked (supporting information Fig. 2).
For each time point, mitotic indexes were determined for
5-10 outgrowths of each type (FT and NT).

www.StemCells.com

Interestingly, when we compared the mitotic index of Oct4-
positive and -negative cell colonies within FT and NT out-
growths kept 10 days in culture, we found that in FT and NT
outgrowths, Oct4-positive cell colonies had a signiﬁcantly
higher proliferation rate than the Oct4-negative—differenti-
ated—colonies (data not shown). Then we looked at Oct4-
expressing areas only and we found that most of the mitotic
indexes were comprised between 4% and 12% after 24 hours
(Fig. 3C) and between 3% and 8% at 10 days of in vitro culture.
The cell proliferation was signiﬁcantly lower in NT outgrowths
(Fig. 4C) after 24 hours of in vitro culture whereas no differ-
ence could be detected after 10 days. Consequently, growth
deregulations observed in NT epiblasts in vivo [18] could still
be detected in vitro after 24 hours of culture, but disappeared
after a prolonged period of culture. Since EpiSC derivation efﬁ-
ciency from FT and NT outgrowths was comparable (Table 1),
these results reveal the existence of mechanisms by which cell
proliferation defects in the Oct4-expressing cells of the NT out-
growths are corrected by in vitro culture.

FT and NT-EpiSCs Are Distinguishable on the
Transcriptomic Level
FT- and NT-EpiSC lines could not be distinguished by their
self-renewal property or their capacity of differentiation. There-
fore, we decided to further characterize NT- and FT-EpiSCs by
performing gene expression proﬁling. However, some of our
FT-EpiSC lines were male (namely, FT.1 and FT.2), whereas
all the NT lines were female. To exclude sex-related differences
from our subsequent analyses, we compared the transcriptomic
proﬁle of pre-streak male and female whole embryos: with an
adjusted p value <.05 for the Student’s t test we could not
detect differential gene expression between male and female
(data not shown). These results reinforced previous studies
showing the limited inﬂuence of sex on gene expression in
ESCs [27]. Then we performed a hierarchical clustering for all
six EpiSC lines (Fig. 5A), and surprisingly, individual EpiSC
line expression proﬁles grouped into two main clusters (Fig.
5B). One that included three FT lines plus NT.1 and thus was
named ‘‘FT-like’’ and one that comprised NT-LE and NT.2
lines and was named ‘‘abnormal’’. Hence, nuclear transfer-
derived embryos seem able to give rise to NT-EpiSC lines that
have expression proﬁles similar to their control counterparts,
and also to NT-EpiSC lines that behave differently on the tran-
scriptional level.
Further analyses revealed that 111 (out of 16061) tran-
scripts were signiﬁcantly (Student t test with p  .05) up- or
downregulated between the two groups. Among them, 80%
are downregulated in abnormal NT-EPiSCs. Twenty-ﬁve were
differentially expressed with a twofold change or more (Table
2). Noteworthy, the most affected transcripts (dysregulations
with folds superior to 10) were all downregulated and they all
correspond to imprinted genes such as Snrpn/Snrpn upstream
reading frame (Snrpn/Snurf), necdin (Ndn), mesoderm-speciﬁc
transcripts (Mest), imprinted and ancient (Impact), and pater-
nally expressed 3 (Peg3) [28].

In the course of our microarray data analysis, we also
found that an unusually high proportion (30%, 32/111) of dif-
ferentially expressed transcripts originated from genes present
on chromosome 11. To conﬁrm this observation, we com-
pared the distribution of the transcripts expressed in EpiSCs
(FT or NT) on the 20 pairs of chromosomes to that of the dif-
ferentially expressed transcripts (Fig. 5D). Statistical analysis

imprinted genes, Snrpn/Snurf, Ndn, and Peg, were drastically
downregulated in NT-LE and NT.2 compared to the FT-like
EpiSCs. To further demonstrate that downregulated expression
of these imprinted genes was a feature speciﬁc to NT-EpiSCs,
similar analyses were performed in FT- and NT-ESC lines,
showing that the expression of Peg3 and Ndn was normal in
these pluripotent cells (supporting information Fig. 5).

We also compared the level of expression of two other
dysregylated genes, keratin 19 (Krt19) and glucoronidase beta
(Gusb), by quantitative PCR (Fig. 5A). The results were in
accordance with the transcriptomic data, except
that NT.1
expression levels were in these cases closer to those of NT.2
and NT-LE than to the FT lines. This result shows that, for at
least some genes, NT.1 tends to behave like the other NT-
EpiSC lines. It is in accordance with the data from the hier-
archical clustering (Fig. 4A), where the cluster comprising the
NT.1 biological repeats was branched between the FT lines
cluster, and the NT-LE and NT.2 cluster.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that derivation
of EpiSCs from NT-embryo transfer can generate pluripotent
lines incorrectly reprogrammed and genes located on chromo-
some 11 appear to be speciﬁcally targeted by these reprog-
ramming errors.

dered if the perturbation of this methylation pattern could
be responsible for the decrease in expression observed in
NT-EpiSCs. To validate this hypothesis, we checked the DNA
methylation status of one of the most dramatically downregu-
lated imprinted genes, Snrpn/Snurf. Importantly, this gene is
known to have stable and robust imprint that is not affected
by environmental parameters such as long-term passages of
cells and embryo culture [29]. In sum, the methylation status
of the DMR was determined using bisulﬁte genomic sequenc-
ing (Fig. 5B and supporting information Fig. 6) and the pres-
ence of polymorphism at all CpG sites was evidenced in the
FT-EpiSCs and somatic tissues, in accordance with a methyla-
tion of maternal alleles and a demethylation of paternal alleles
[30]. However, a loss of polymorphism was found at all CpG
positions in NT-EpiSCs. The two abnormal NT-EpiSCs (NT.2
and NT-LE) displayed a full methylation, suggesting a meth-
ylation of both parental alleles. By contrast, we observed a
nearly complete demethylation of the Snrpn/Snurf DMR for

the NT.1 EpiSC line. Therefore, repression of Snurf/Snrpn
expression in the abnormal NT-EpiSCs could be explained by
allelic silencing through methylation. Taken together, these
results conﬁrm that that there are clear-cut epigenetic differ-
ences between FT- and NT-EpiSCs at the single-gene level.

DISCUSSION

Divergences Between EpiSC Derived from NT
Embryos or Fertilized Counterparts
In this study, we showed that EpiSCs can be derived with the
same efﬁciency from NT embryos and from fertilized
embryos. NT-EpiSCs appear to behave similarly to their FT
counterpart as they show the same capacity to proliferate, to
express markers of pluripotency such as Oct4, Nanog, and
Sox2 and to form embryoid bodies capable of differentiating
into derivatives of the three germ layers. However, our study
also revealed that NT and FT cell lines can also display diver-
gent gene expression proﬁles. The expression of imprinted
genes appears to be particularly variable because of an abnor-
mal methylation pattern of these genomic regions in NT-
EpiSCs. This is in striking contrast to the data obtained with
ESC lines isolated from NT or FT blastocysts [13, 14]. ESCs
and EpiSCs are both obtained from the epiblast, but at differ-
ent developmental periods, respectively the blastocyst and the
pregastrula stages. This suggests that
the epigenetic errors
imposed on embryonic cells during the process of reprogram-
ming become apparent during the transition from early to late
epiblast stages.

Nevertheless, the observation that the mean mitotic index
of Oct4-expressing cells in NT-epiblast-derived outgrowths is

initially low, but becomes similar to FT epiblast-derived ones
after 10 days of culture indicates that an in vitro culture pe-
riod may be able to correct some of the pre-existing cellular
defects induced by the NT procedure. Alternatively, the more
correctly reprogrammed pluripotent cells within an outgrowth
could gain a selective advantage, and further partial reprog-
ramming could also take place during the in vitro culture.
Interestingly, this hypothesis is reinforced by a recent report
demonstrating that human-induced pluripotent
stem cells
(hiPSC) at late passage are closer to hESCs than hiPSCs at
early passage [31].

Difference in Imprinted Gene Expression Between
‘‘Abnormal’’ NT-EpiSCs and ‘‘FT-like’’ EpiSCs
Among the transcripts found differentially expressed between
‘‘abnormal’’ and ‘‘FT-like’’ EpiSC, the most dysregulated ones
(Snrpn/Snurf, Ndn, Mest,
from
imprinted genes. Such genes can have a perturbed expression
in embryos because of incorrect epigenetic reprogramming af-
ter NT [32, 33] or in ESCs as a result of accumulated epi-
mutations occurring during in vitro culture [34, 35]. Several
reports have shown the epigenetic stability of Snrpn/Snurf,
Ndn, and Peg3 in mESCs [29, 36] and hESCs [37–39] during
long-term in vitro culture. After nuclear transfer, disruption of
methylation for Snrpn/Snurf and Peg3 has been evidenced in
NT blastocysts and one NT-ESC line, respectively [32, 36].
Noteworthy, all the reported cases of perturbations affecting
imprinted genes show a loss of imprint and biallelic expres-
sion, whereas in the present study we report repression of
expression in some NT-EpiSCs lines. Moreover, we have
been able to correlate the repression of expression of Snrpn/
Snurf with hypermethylation of the DMR region, supporting
the view that
the paternal allele has been silenced. Data
regarding expression of imprinted genes just after implanta-
tion in mouse NT embryos are limited and only Snrpn/Snurf,
Ndn, and Peg have been found to be faithfully expressed in
livers of NT pups [40] and also Mest at 9.5 dpc [41]. Down-
regulation of Snrpn/Snurf and Ndn (together with Mkrn3)
induces postnatal lethality [42], whereas downregulation of
Mest results in embryonic growth retardation between E15
and E18 [43]. Therefore, concomitant downregulation of these
genes by abnormal methylation at the epiblast stage could
explain the wave of mortality observed just after implantation
and before E7 in NT embryos [18]. Noteworthy, another
imprinted gene Cdkn1c (p57) found upregulated in our abnor-
mal NT-EpiSC has been implicated in embryonic growth
retardation and lethality upon a twofold upregulation [44].

In addition, most of the imprinted genes strongly downre-
gulated in abnormal NT-EpiSCs are expressed in the brain
[43, 45–48] where some of them are known to play a crucial
role in neuronal differentiation [49–55]. Therefore, NT-EpiSC
lines could have limited capacity to generate functional neuro-
nal cells and further studies will focus on comparing neuronal
differentiation of FT and NT-EpiSCs.

Can Chromosome 11 Be Considered As a Speciﬁc
Target for Dysregulated Gene Expression in
Abnormal NT-EpiSCs?
A puzzling result of our work is the bias that we have evi-
denced in the genomic localization of the genes found to be
downregulated in NT EpiSCs. A signiﬁcant fraction of these
genes are located on chromosome 11, suggesting a speciﬁc
involvement of this chromosome in abnormal development of
early postimplantation NT mouse embryos. Interestingly, pre-
dictive analyses have suggested that chromosome 11 is partic-
ularly enriched in genes essential for full-term development

Maruotti, Dai, Brochard et al.

751

[56]. In addition, this chromosome has also been shown in the
mouse to be particularly enriched in CpG islands at gene pro-
moters [57]. Together, these data suggest that chromosome 11
could require speciﬁc mechanisms to be reprogrammed. At
last, our observations provide an additional support
to the
view that epigenetic more than genetic defects account for the
high rate of compromised development observed after nuclear
transfer in the mouse once NT blastocysts have formed. We
cannot exclude that subtle chromosomic abnormalities affect-
ing chromosome 11, below the level of detection of the G-
banding analysis, could have occurred earlier during the pro-
cess of nuclear transfer itself or in vitro culture [58, 59].
However, the odds of chromosomal rearrangement occurring
on the same chromosome in two different NT-EpiSC lines but
not in FT-EPiSC lines is rather small. Extension of this result
to different genetic backgrounds
is underway in our
laboratory.

CONCLUSION

Taken together, our results demonstrate that the reprogram-
ming errors following nuclear transfer perturb the normal pro-
cess of epigenetic modiﬁcations occurring in the developing
epiblast. Inappropriate methylation can result
in abnormal
expression of a large set of genes, one-third of them being
located on chromosome 11. Recently, Bao and colleagues
have shown that EpiSCs can be reprogrammed into ES-like
cells, so called rESCs, showing that some epigenetic barriers
could be overcome in vitro [3]. In this regard, our model of
EpiSCs derived from NT embryos constitutes an original
