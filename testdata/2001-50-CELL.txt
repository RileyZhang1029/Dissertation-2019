Chin, and Roger Brent The Molecular Sciences Institute 2168 Shattuck Avenue Berkeley, California 94704 Summary In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mothers and daughters have distinct fates.
We show that Cbk1 kinase and its interacting protein Mob2 regulate this asymmetry by inducing daughter-specific genetic programs.
Daugh- ter-specific expression is due to Cbk1/Mob2-depen- dent activation and localization of the Ace2 transcrip- tion factor to the daughter nucleus.
Ectopic localization of active Ace2 to mother nuclei is sufficient to activate daughter-specific genes in mothers.
Eight genes are daughter-specific under the tested conditions, while two are daughter-specific only in saturated cultures.
Some daughter-specific gene products contribute to cell separation by degrading the cell wall.
These exper- iments define programs of gene expression specific to daughters and describe how those programs are controlled.
Introduction Multicellular organisms are made up of different cell types organized into tissues and organs.
One source of cellular diversity is asymmetric cell division due to differential segregation of mRNAs and proteins that de- termine cell fate.
Numerous mechanisms underlying such asymmetry have been described in bacteria (Ja- cobs and Shapiro, 1998), worms (Rose and Kemphues, 1998), flies (Lu et al., 1998, 2000), and yeast (below). Saccharomyces cerevisiae reproduces by budding.
Mother cells form buds that separate to become daugh- ters. Daughters and mothers are genetically identical but constitute distinct cell types.
Many daughter compo- nents, such as the cell wall and plasma membrane, have been newly synthesized during the budding process.
In addition, newborn daughters are smaller than their mothers, and thus spend more time in G1 before they are large enough to start budding themselves.
Separation of daughters from mothers is asymmetric.
During budding, chitin is preferentially deposited at the bud site, where it forms a ring around the base of the emerging bud (Sloat and Pringle, 1978). After the cell membranes sepa- rate, a septum made of cell wall material forms between the cells, inside the chitin ring.
Degradation of this sep- tum causes cell separation.
The mother retains most of its chitin and displays a ring (the bud scar ) visible by staining chitin with calcofluor, while the daughter is left with a circle in which chitin has been degraded (the birth scar  Pringle, 1991). During the 1970s, one mechanism underlying mother- 1 Correspondence: colman-lerner@molsci.org daughter asymmetry began to be revealed.
Haploid yeast switch between a and  mating types.
Mothers switch mating type, while daughters do not.
Once they have budded, the former daughters (now mothers) switch mating type (Strathern and Herskowitz, 1979 and references therein). Switching occurs by replacement of a- or -specific DNA sequences at the MAT locus with sequences of the opposite mating type (Oshima and Takano, 1971), a process initiated when the HO endonuclease, expressed only in mothers (Nasmyth, 1983), makes a double strand break at MAT (Strathern et al., 1982). Since the 1980s, study of the molecular mechanisms causing the differences between mothers and daughters has occupied a mainstream place in mo- lecular biology.
Yeast mother-daughter asymmetry pro- vides a tractable system to elucidate the means by which cells give rise to progeny whose gene expression differs as a consequence of internal molecular events rather than as a consequence of different environmental conditions.
Continued work during the 1980s revealed the SWI gene products, positive regulators of HO transcription (Stern et al., 1984 Breeden and Nasmyth, 1987). By the early 1990s, some lines of evidence led to the view that mother-specific transcription of HO was due to Swi5, which was degraded in daughters but a small portion of which was protected in mothers (Tebb et al., 1993). However, failure to detect asymmetrical localization of Swi5 led to the suspicion that this idea might be incorrect (Nasmyth, 1993), and isolation of ash1 mutants, in which switching occurs in daughters, led to the current model for mother-specific expression of HO (Sil and Hersko- witz, 1996 Bobola et al., 1996). In this view, daughters do not switch mating type because Ash1 represses tran- scription of their HO genes.
Ash1 functions only in daughters because its mRNA, synthesized in early G1, is transported via actin cables to the bud, a process that requires Myo4, She2, She3, She4, and Bni1. In the bud, ASH1 mRNA is translated at anaphase, whereupon Ash1 protein translocates to the daughter nucleus and represses HO (Sil and Herskowitz, 1996 Bobola et al., 1996 Jansen et al., 1996). Aside from this regulation of HO, molecular mechanisms for mother-daughter asym- metry have not been described.
ASH1 transcription itself requires SWI5. Gene expres- sion monitoring studies have shown that SWI5 belongs to a cell cycle regulated expression cluster induced during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle in this case, the CLB2 cluster, named for its prototype mem- ber, the gene encoding the B-type cyclin Clb2 (Spellman et al., 1998). Phosphorylation of Swi5 by Cdc28/Clb2 causes Swi5 to concentrate in the cytoplasm.
At ana- phase, Clb2 is degraded, and dephosphorylated Swi5 accumulates and migrates to the nucleus (Nasmyth et al., 1990 Moll et al., 1991), where it induces expression of ASH1 and other genes in early G1. ACE2 is another member of the CLB2 cluster.
Ace2 and Swi5 are paralogs that date from a duplication that doubled the ancestral S. cerevisiae genome (Wolfe and Shields, 1997). The proteins are 34% identical in se-  Cell 740 Figure 1.

quence and recognize the same DNA sites in vitro (Dohr- mann et al., 1996). Either is sufficient for expression of several genes (McBride et al., 1999), including SIC1 (Nugroho and Mendenhall, 1994 Toyn et al., 1997), EGT2, which encodes a protein involved in cell separa- tion (Bobola et al., 1996 Kovacech et al., 1996), and ASH1 (Bobola et al., 1996). However, in some cases, the function of the paralogs has diverged.
Ace2, but not Swi5, is needed for the expression of CTS1, SCW11, YER124C, and YHR143W (Kuranda and Robbins, 1991 Doolin et al., 2001), while Swi5, but not Ace2, is required for expression of HO (Dohrmann et al., 1992). Expression of CTS1, which encodes chitinase, a se- creted enzyme required for cell separation, requires the protein kinase Cbk1 (Racki et al., 2000). cbk1 strains fail to separate after mitosis and grow in clumps (Racki et al., 2000, and this paper). Mutations in ACE2 suppress the cbk1 separation defect, and Cbk1 and Ace2 inter- act in two-hybrid experiments, suggesting that Cbk1 might regulate CTS1 expression by activating Ace2 (Racki et al., 2000). We isolated Cbk1 independently as a target in a hunt for peptide aptamers that blocked  factor-induced cell cycle arrest (Geyer et al., 1999). We showed that Cbk1 interacts with the pheromone path- way proteins Ste5 and Ste50 (Geyer et al., 1999). cbk1 strains show partial resistance to  factor and defects in mating projection formation (shmooing), which prompted us to propose that Cbk1 connects the phero- mone pathway to pathways that regulate cell morphol- ogy (Geyer et al., 1999). Cbk1 interacts with a number of proteins, including Mob1 (Ito et al., 2001), which is needed for exit from mitosis, presumably to activate the Mob1-interacting protein kinase Dbf2 (Lee et al., 2001). Cbk1 also interacts with Mob2, a protein whose se-  Daughter-Specific Genetic Programs in Yeast 741 quence is 90% identical to that of Mob1 (Racki et al., 2000). Here, we describe two distinct programs of gene ex- pression in daughter cells.
Both programs require Cbk1, Mob2, and Ace2. We first found that the CTS1 gene is expressed only by daughters.
We identified other genes coexpressed under seemingly irrelevant conditions, then determined which of these candidate genes had promoters that drove daughter-specific expression.
Daughter-specific expression results from Cbk1- and Mob2-dependent activation and localization of Ace2 to the daughter nucleus.
One daughter-specific expression program consists of eight genes induced in daughter cells in early G1. It includes genes of known function, and four relatively uncharacterized genes which we named DSE, for Daughter-Specific Expression.
The other program consists of two genes, ASH1 and EGT2. This program is conditional: in exponentially growing cultures, these genes are expressed in both mothers and daughters, but in saturated cultures, they are expressed only in daughters.
Taken together with the enzymatic activities of the encoded proteins, our results indicate that some daughter-specific gene products bring about cell separation by degrading the septum from the daughter side of the mother-daughter pair.
Results CTS1 Is Expressed in and Localized to Daughter Cells To characterize Cbk1-dependent CTS1 regulation, we constructed a single-copy plasmid that carried the YFP gene under the control of the CTS1 promoter ( 762 to 1 here, we refer to the nucleotide upstream of the start codon as 1). In exponentially growing yeast car- rying PCTS1-YFP, fluorescence was restricted to daugh- ters in mother-daughter pairs (Figure 1a). In contrast, only mothers expressed PHO ( 1807 to 1)-YFP, and both mothers and daughters expressed PSIC1 ( 1213 to 1)-YFP (Figure 1c). To confirm the daughter cell designation, we monitored cells bearing PCTS1-YFP by time-lapse pho- tomicroscopy. We observed that after each cell finished dividing, only the newly budded cell, the daughter, be- came fluorescent (n  50 cells). In Figure 1b, we show one example cell.
At time 0, the unbudded cell displays fluorescence, consistent with CTS1 being expressed in early G1. As the cell buds, YFP fluorescence decreases (from 15 to 90 min), and the newly formed daughter becomes fluorescent (from 105 to 150 min). These re- sults are consistent with the conclusion that CTS1 ex- pression is restricted to daughters.
We also observed that in W303 diploid strains carrying PCTS1-YFP, fluores- cence was restricted to daughters (not shown). Since CTS1, the gene encoding chitinase, was ex- pressed only in daughters, we wondered whether chi- tinase might be concentrated in the daughter cell wall.
We constructed ACLY362, a strain that expresses a Cts1-YFP fusion, and examined the fluorescence local- ization. In mother-daughter pairs, Cts1-YFP localized to the bud neck (Figure 1d). To determine whether Cts1- YFP was localized to the daughter side of the bud neck cell wall, we stained the cells with calcofluor white.
As shown in Figure 1d, YFP fluorescence was seen on one side of the bud neck, while calcofluor staining of chitin was concentrated on the opposite side.
These results are consistent with the idea that chitinase, secreted by daughters, is concentrated on the daughter side of the bud neck.
The only previously studied case of asymmetric ex- pression in yeast, mother-specific expression of HO, results from daughter-specific accumulation of the HO repressor Ash1. Therefore, we tested whether daughter- specific expression of CTS1 depended on Ash1 or Ash1 localization.
We observed the expression of PCTS1-YFP in ash1, myo4, and she4 cells (not shown). In all strains, the YFP signal was daughter-specific.
There- fore, daughter-specific CTS1 expression was indepen- dent of Ash1 and the machinery involved in ASH1 mRNA transport.
We investigated the dependence of CTS1 daughter- specific gene expression on Cbk1 and Ace2. In ace2 cells, PCTS1-YFP fluorescence was undetectable in cbk1 cells, PCTS1-YFP fluorescence was greatly reduced and asymmetric expression was lost.
Deletion of SWI5, which is not involved in CTS1 expression, did not affect asymmetric PCTS1-YFP fluorescence (Figure 1a). In con- trast, deletion of cbk1 or ace2 did not affect mother- specific expression of PHO-YFP, while deletion of SWI5 abolished it (not shown). CTS1 Defines a Larger Set of Cbk1- and Ace2- Dependent Daughter-Specific Genes We set out to identify possible additional daughter-spe- cific genes by whole-genome gene expression monitor- ing. No mother-daughter differential whole-genome ex- pression data was available to us.
However, we tested the idea that other daughter-specific genes might be coregulated with CTS1 under different, seemingly irrele- vant conditions.
Since CTS1 is cell cycle regulated, we first examined other genes that were cell cycle regulated in a CTS1-like manner.
From gene expression monitoring experiments, CTS1 has been grouped in a set of genes designated as the SIC1 cluster.
This cluster is transcribed in late M and/or early G1 (Spellman et al., 1998 Figure 2a). Some of the SIC1 cluster genes are known to require either Swi5 or Ace2 for expression, and most contain putative binding sites for these activators in their regula- tory regions (Spellman et al., 1998). We used YFP report- ers to examine expression from the promoters (from 1200 to 1 for each gene) for the genes in the SIC1 cluster and from other genes whose expression is con- trolled by Swi5 and Ace2 (see Tables 1 and 2). Seven of the 26 tested promoters (CST13, PRY3, SCW11, YER124C, YHR143W, YOR264W, and YNR067C) di- rected daughter-specific fluorescence in exponentially growing cells.
16 promoters displayed approximately equal fluorescence in mothers and daughters, and three showed no detectable YFP fluorescence (Figure 1e and Tables 1 and 2). Six of the eight daughter-specific pro- moters (including CTS1) belonged to a smaller, eight- gene subnode of the SIC1 cluster (Figure 2a). Four of the genes (YER124C, YHR143W, YOR264W, and YNR067C) were previously only partly characterized (Doolin et al., 2001, Drees et al., 2001) we named these DSE1, DSE2, DSE3, and DSE4 (for Daughter-Specific Expression). As  Cell 742 Figure 2.
Coregulation of Daughter-Specific Genes and Analysis of Existing Whole- Genome Expression Data (a) Expression of the SIC1 cluster genes as yeast progress through the cell cycle after release from  factor-, cdc15-2-, and cdc28- 4-arrest and after collection from an elutria- tion chamber (Spellman et al., 1998). Mem- bers of the first group of daughter-specific genes defined here (CTS1, CST13, DSE1, DSE2, SCW11, DSE3, DSE4 and PRY3) are underlined and marked with a circle.
Note that CTS1, CST13, DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 be- long to one branch of this cluster (in cyan) while DSE3 and DSE4 belong to another.
These two genes differ in their regulation from the other daughter-specific genes in re- sponse to some perturbations in particular, DSE3 and DSE4 are not induced by  factor.
(b) Daughter-specific genes (marked with cir- cles) are coregulated in response to deletion of different genes (Hughes et al., 2000). Each column corresponds to a different deletion or drug treatment.
(c) Unconditional and conditional daughter- specific genes (marked with circles) cluster together in the environmental stress re- sponse data set (Gasch et al., 2000). Stress conditions are heat shock (HS), increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), menadione (M), dithiothreitol (dtt), diamide (D) and sorbitol (Sor), time after amino acid deprivation (aa), nitrogen depletion (N dpl) or growth on YPD (YPD), time course of diauxic shift (DS) or steady state (SS), and growth in different carbon sources (CS). In (a) and (b), we clustered the original raw data using the Cluster software (Eisen et al., 1998) in (c), the clustering was performed by Gasch et al. (2000).

We identified cells as mothers or daughters by staining chi- tin with calcofluor (arrows indicate birth scars arrowheads, bud scars). Figure shows representative mother-daughter pairs.
for CTS1, there was no detectable YFP expression from these seven promoters in cbk1 or ace2 strains, and YFP expression in swi5 strains was indistinguishable from that in wild-type (not shown). ASH1 and EGT2 Define Another, Conditional, Set of Cbk1- and Ace2-Dependent Daughter-Specific Genes If the eight daughter-specific genes defined a transcrip- tional regulon, then they might be expected to show similar patterns of expression in circumstances other than cell cycle progression.
To test this idea, we exam- ined whole-genome expression data from cells per- turbed by environmental stresses and carbon source changes (Gasch et al., 2000) and by deletion of different genes and various drug treatments (Hughes et al., 2000). In both datasets, most of the daughter-specific genes were coregulated (Table 1 and Figure 2c and 2c). PRY3 did not cluster with the rest of the daughter-specific genes in any of the other datasets, while DSE4 only  Daughter-Specific Genetic Programs in Yeast 743 Table 1.

ASH1 was coregulated with the daughter-specific genes in the stress-response dataset but not in the dele- tion dataset. These results suggested that under envi- ronmental stress conditions, expression of ASH1 (and perhaps of other genes) might be restricted to daugh- ters. To test this idea, we examined YFP fluorescence driven by PASH1 and the other previously tested promot- ers in saturated cultures (see Experimental Procedures). Here, for daughter cell designation, we stained cells with calcofluor white, which labels bud scars (Pringle, 1991), present only in mothers.
Under this stress condition, PASH1-YFP and PEGT2-YFP-derived fluorescence were only visible in cells lacking bud scars, i.e., daughters, as were the eight previously identified daughter-specific promoters (Figure 2d). The remaining 16 promoters ei- ther did not direct YFP expression or directed equal expression in mothers and daughters (see Table 2). In saturated cultures, daughter-specific expression of ASH1 and EGT2 required Ace2 and Cbk1 but was inde- pendent of Swi5 (not shown). This observation sug- gested that EGT2 and ASH1 define a separate, condi- tional program of daughter-specific gene expression active in saturated cultures.
Ace2 Localizes to the Daughter Nucleus Expression of ACE2-dependent genes was restricted to daughters.
We hypothesized that this might be the result Table 2.

To test this idea, we used a plasmid containing a YFP-Ace2 fusion protein under the control of PACE2. This plasmid complemented the separation defect in ace2 cells (not shown), indicat- ing that the fusion protein was functional.
We observed the localization of YFP-Ace2 at the end of the first mitosis after  factor arrest (approximately 80 min). Arrest in- duces formation of mating projections that are not re- sorbed, allowing mothers to be distinguished from daughters born after release.
At the end of mitosis, YFP- Ace2 expression was confined to daughter nuclei (Fig- ure 3a), except for a fraction of cells (ⵑ10%) that showed both mother and daughter nuclear YFP signal.
Ace2 Transiently Translocates to the Mother Nucleus We realized that localization of Ace2 to the daughter nucleus could be due to at least three mechanisms: (1) preferential accumulation of Ace2 in the cytoplasm of the future daughter followed by import into the nearest nucleus, (2) export/degradation of Ace2 from/within the mother nucleus, or (3) preferential import of Ace2 into the daughter nucleus.
To distinguish among these pos- sibilities, we monitored the localization of YFP-Ace2 in cells released from  factor arrest by time-lapse photo- microscopy.
Before its nuclear transport, YFP-Ace2 was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of the mother and the nascent daughter.
Initially, YFP-Ace2 translocated to both mother and daughter nuclei.
Whereas YFP fluo- rescence in the mother nucleus disappeared rapidly, it continued to increase in the daughter nucleus up to a maximum at 22 min, after which it decreased (Figures 3b and 4c). Since YFP-Ace2 was degraded in late G1 in both cell types, it seemed possible that YFP-Ace2 disappeared faster from mother nuclei because mothers complete G1 more rapidly.
To test this possibility, we made a strain that carried the cdc15-2 allele and used this temperature-sensitive mutation to arrest cells at telophase. Mothers and daughters released from such arrest cycle nearly synchronously during the first cell division (Futcher, 1999). After release from cdc15 block, YFP-Ace2 still accumulated in daughter nuclei after a transient state in which it localized to both nuclei (not  Cell 744 Figure 3.

shown). These findings are thus consistent with a combi- nation of mechanisms 2 and 3, in which asymmetric localization of Ace2 is the result of its rapid removal from the mother nucleus, either by degradation or export, together with its preferential import into the daughter nucleus.
The Cbk1 Interacting Protein Mob2 Is Required for Daughter-Specific Expression In order to gain further insight into the mechanism re- sponsible for daughter-specific expression, we ana- lyzed the cell separation phenotype in strains which lacked the genes coding for proteins known to interact with Cbk1: Yol036, Lre1, Ssd1, Not3, and Mob2 (Racki et al., 2000). Among these mutants, the mob2 strain, ACLY363, but no others, showed a cell separation defect (below). In ACLY363, expression of constitutive daugh- ter-specific genes was undetectable.
In saturated cul- tures, expression of EGT2 and ASH1 was greatly re- duced and asymmetric expression was lost (data not shown). This fact suggested that the separation defect in mob2 cells arises because of defects in the expres- sion of chitinase and other daughter-specific gene prod- ucts. The function of Mob2 is unknown, but its homolog, Mob1, interacts with the mitotic exit network kinase Dbf2 and is required for its activation (Mah et al., 2001). Dbf1 shares 31% sequence identity and 52% sequence simi- larity with Cbk1. We suggest that Mob2 may be required to activate Cbk1. Cbk1 and Mob2 Localize to the Growing Bud Tip, Then to the Bud Neck and the Daughter Nucleus To understand the mechanism of Cbk1/Mob2/Ace2 acti- vation of daughter-specific genes, we determined the subcellular localization of Cbk1 and Mob2 using protein fusions to GFP (Cbk1) or YFP (Mob2) and tracked fluo- rescence as cells progressed through the cell cycle after release from  factor arrest.
Localization of Cbk1-GFP and Mob2-YFP was similar (Figures 4a and 5d, top). Before release from arrest, Cbk1-GFP and Mob2-YFP were localized to the schmoo tip.
In budding cells (50 min after release), both proteins were present in the growing bud membrane.
In large budded cells (80 min after release, in which mother and daughter DNA have separated), both proteins were localized to the bud neck and the daughter nucleus.
We performed time-lapse photomicroscopy of exponentially growing cultures to determine if, as for Ace2, Cbk1 and Mob2 transiently localize to the mother nucleus.
We observed a small amount of Cbk1-GFP and Mob2-YFP in the mother nu- cleus (Figure 4b and not shown) that lasted for about  Daughter-Specific Genetic Programs in Yeast 745 Figure 4.

Cbk1 Kinase Activity and Mob2 Are Required for Transcriptionally Active Ace2 to Accumulate in the Daughter Nucleus Since Cbk1 and Mob2 were necessary for the induction of the daughter-specific Ace2-dependent genes, we ex- amined whether asymmetric nuclear localization of Ace2 required Cbk1 and Mob2. We monitored YFP-Ace2 in cbk1 and mob2 cells.
In these cells, YFP-Ace2 was present in both mother and daughter nuclei (Figure 5a and data not shown), suggesting that Cbk1 and Mob2 might be required for accumulation of Ace2 in the daugh- ter nucleus but not for nuclear translocation per se. In the absence of Cbk1 or Mob2, daughter-specific genes were not expressed (Figure 1 and data not shown), even though Ace2 was in the nucleus.
This result suggested that Cbk1 and Mob2 have an additional function(s) needed for Ace2 to activate transcription.
To test whether these functions required Cbk1 protein kinase activity, we constructed a strain that expresses a mutant Cbk1 (Cbk1-M429A) with a lesion in its ATP binding pocket.
This lesion makes the ATP binding site larger, allowing it to interact with the inhibitors NaPP1 and 1NM-PP1 (Bishop et al., 2000). In the absence of  Cell 746 Figure 5.

However, in the presence of 100 nM NaPP1 or 1 M 1NM-PP1, cells carrying Cbk1- M429A showed the characteristic cbk1 separation de- fect (not shown). Under these conditions, a Cbk1- M429A-GFP fusion exhibited a normal pattern of local- ization (not shown). In untreated Cbk1-M429A cells, YFP-Ace2 was local- ized only to daughter nuclei.
In mutants treated with inhibitors, YFP-Ace2 was localized to both mother and daughter nuclei (Figure 5a). Similarly, Cbk1-M429A cells treated with inhibitors showed no YFP fluorescence from PCTS1 and other daughter-specific reporters (not shown). These experiments indicate that Cbk1 kinase activity is required for specific accumulation of Ace2 in the daughter nucleus, and also for an additional function needed to activate transcription of daughter-specific genes.
Active Ectopic Ace2 Activates Daughter-Specific Genes in Mothers To determine if translocation of active Ace2 to the daughter nucleus was sufficient to bring about daugh- ter-specific gene expression, we delivered active Ace2 to the mother nucleus and determined whether active ectopic Ace2 could induce daughter-specific genes in mothers.
Activation and proper localization of wild-type Ace2 requires Cbk1 and Mob2. We reasoned that an Ace2 gain-of-function mutant such as Ace2-G128E, which is active in cbk1 mutants (Racki et al., 2000), might accumulate in both nuclei.
To test this idea, we used a reporter plasmid expressing YFP-Ace2-G128E controlled by PACE2 in wt cells.
This Ace2 mutant accumu- lated in mother and daughter nuclei at the end of mitosis (Figure 5b). We then constructed a strain which ex- pressed Ace2-G128E instead of Ace2 and examined expression of PCTS1-YFP. In this strain, PCTS1-YFP expres- sion was visible in both mothers and daughters (Figure 5c). These results are consistent with the idea that local- ization of Ace2 to the daughter nucleus and its activation by Cbk1/Mob2 are sufficient for daughter-specific gene expression.
Cbk1, Mob2, and Ace2 Are Required to Localize One Another Cbk1 and Mob2 were required to localize Ace2 to the daughter nucleus.
Since Cbk1 and Mob2 interacted and colocalized to the growing bud tip, the bud neck, and the daughter nucleus, we examined the relevant deletion strains to determine whether they were required for each other s localization.
In mob2 cells, Cbk1-GFP was not visible at the bud tip, although it still concentrated at the bud neck at the end of mitosis (Figure 4c). In this mutant, a fraction of Cbk1-GFP localized constitutively to the nucleus.
In cbk1 yeast, Mob2-YFP fluorescence showed a related pattern it was not localized to the bud tip or the bud neck during budding, but at the end of mitosis it concentrated in both mother and daughter nuclei (Figure 4d, bottom). These results are consistent with the conclusion that Cbk1 and Mob2 are required for the correct localization of one another in time and space.
The pattern of nuclear localization of Mob2 was similar to that of Ace2. Therefore, we asked if Ace2 was required for Mob2 nuclear transport.
To test this idea, we used ace2 cells that expressed Mob2-YFP. In these cells, Mob2-YFP fluorescence localized to the bud tip and the bud neck but did not accumulate in the nucleus (Figure 4d, middle). This finding suggested that Ace2 was re- quired for Mob2 nuclear transport.
In further support of this conclusion, in yeast bearing the gain-of-function mutant Ace2-G128E, Mob2-YFP fluorescence localized to both mother and daughter nuclei at the end of mitosis  Daughter-Specific Genetic Programs in Yeast 747 Figure 6.
Summary Model for Induction of Daughter-Specific Ge- netic Programs Ace2 is localized to the cytoplasm during mitosis due to phosphory- lation (Ace2-P) by Cdc28/Cbl1 and Cdc28/Clb2. At the end of mito- sis, Clb1 and Clb2 are degraded, increasing the amount of nonphos- phorylated, noncytoplasmically retained Ace2. At this time, Cbk1 and Mob2 are localized to the bud neck.
Modification of Ace2 by Cbk1 (Ace2*), probably by phosphorylation, both targets Ace2 to the nucleus of the daughter cell and activates the Ace2 transcriptional function.
Ace2 translocates to the nucleus, perhaps in a complex with Cbk1 and Mob2. In the mother nucleus (left), the Ace2 complex (gray letters) disappears, due to export or degradation.
In the daugh- ter nucleus (right), Ace2 accumulates and induces expression of daughter-specific genes, such as CTS1, and of mother-daughter genes, such as SIC1. In saturated cultures, Ace2 also induces ex- pression of a second set of conditional daughter-specific genes, including ASH1 and EGT2. (not shown). Taken together, these results suggested that Mob2 might physically interact with Ace2. Consis- tent with this idea, we observed that a Mob2 bait and an Ace21 449 prey interact in two-hybrid experiments (Figure 4e). Thus, our results indicate that these three proteins interact and are needed for the correct localization of one another.
Discussion We have identified two distinct programs of daughter- specific gene expression in S. cerevisiae. Both programs require Cbk1, Mob2, and Ace2. One consists of genes that are constitutively expressed in daughters.
The other consists of genes that are expressed in daughters condi- tionally, under the stress of growth to saturation.
Genes in both programs are required for cell separation.
Daughter-specific expression is the result of Cbk1- and Mob2-dependent localization of Ace2 to the daughter nucleus.
Cbk1 and Mob2 associate in two-hybrid experi- ments and likely form a complex, much like the Dbf2 kinase pairs with Mob1 (Mah et al., 2001). Moreover, the fact that in two-hybrid experiments Cbk1 and Mob2 each interact with Ace2 and that all three proteins accu- mulate in the daughter nucleus at the end of mitosis suggests that they might form a three protein complex (Finley and Brent, 1994). Cbk1/Mob2 Control of Daughter-Specific Gene Expression Cbk1/Mob2 control of daughter-specific gene expres- sion is summarized in Figure 6.
Ace2 is expressed during G2 (Spellman et al., 1998), before new daughters are born.
At that time, phosphorylation by Cdc28 causes accumulation of Ace2 in the cytoplasm (O Conallain et al., 1999). At the end of anaphase, when Cdc28 kinase activity drops, Ace2 specifically accumulates in the daughter nucleus.
Our data suggest that initially, Cbk1 Mob2-activated Ace2 translocates to both mother and daughter nuclei, perhaps in a complex with Mob2 and Cbk1. Later, import into the mother nucleus stops, and Ace2 in the mother nucleus is either degraded or ex- ported.
Meanwhile, import of activated Ace2 into the daughter nucleus triggers expression of daughter-spe- cific genes.
The Unconditional Program Our experiments defined a set of daughter-specific genes.
One of these genes, CTS1, is rather well studied, and three, SCW11, PRY3, and CTS13, have been at least partially characterized (Cappellaro et al., 1998 Entian et al., 1999 Ouspenski et al., 1999). The other four genes, YER124C, YHR143W, YOR264W, and YNR067C, are rel- atively uncharacterized. We named these genes DSE1, DSE2, DSE3, and DSE4, for Daughter-Specific Expres- sion. Induction of these eight genes required Cbk1, Mob2, and Ace2. Cbk1-dependent (but not daughter- specific) expression of CTS1, SCW11, PRY3, and DSE4 YNR067C has been noted recently by Bidlingmaier et al. (2001). DSE1 might participate in pathways regulating cell wall metabolism, since yeast bearing deletions of dse1 have increased sensitivity to drugs that affect cell wall (Doolin et al., 2001), and Dse1 interacts by two- hybrid analysis with the bud formation proteins Boi1 and Boi2 (Drees et al., 2001). Consideration of existing sequence data suggested that the SCW11, DSE2, and DSE4 products might help degrade the cell wall and separate daughter cells from mother cells (see below). By contrast, the sequence of the other daughter-specific genes (CST13, PRY3, and DSE3) did not immediately suggest their functions, but their daughter-specific ex- pression suggests that they may also help establish daughter fate.
The Conditional Program Our results also uncovered a second program.
This pro- gram causes daughter-specific expression of genes un- der particular environmental conditions.
In exponentially growing cultures, ASH1 and EGT2 are expressed in mothers and daughters, and either Swi5 or Ace2 can activate their expression.
However, in saturated cul- tures, transcription of these genes is restricted to daugh- ter cells and shifts from dual control by Swi5 and Ace2 to exclusive control by Ace2 (Figure 2d and Table 1). In saturated cultures, expression of the Swi5-dependent HO promoter is greatly diminished (Table 2), suggesting that the shift in control may be due to a reduction in Swi5 activity.
ASH1 protein product is expressed in daughters due to daughter-specific localization of its mRNA. Our find- ing that, in saturated cultures, activity of the ASH1 pro- moter is also confined to daughters identifies a second mechanism of daughter-specific ASH1 expression.
It is possible that in saturated cultures (and perhaps in colonies), both mechanisms are active.
If so, the effect would be to localize Ash1 (and perhaps other proteins)  Cell 748 to daughters of daughters and thus to bring about cell fates specific to granddaughters.
Such localization of Ash1 would mean that, in saturated cultures, mothers and daughters, but not granddaughters, could switch mating types.
Cell Separation Cells lacking CBK1 or its target genes CTS1 and SCW11 show defects in mother-daughter separation (Kuranda and Robbins, 1991, Cappellaro et al., 1998). CTS1 en- codes chitinase. SCW11 encodes a protein with se- quence similarity to glucanases. DSE2 and DSE4 also encode secreted proteins with sequence similarity to glucanases. It seems likely, then, that at least these four daughter-specific genes encode proteins that degrade the cell wall from the daughter side and cause daughters to separate from mothers.
Cells lacking the conditional daughter-specific gene EGT2 also show separation de- fects. EGT2 encodes a cell wall protein, and cells lacking EGT2 show overall reductions in glucanase levels (Kova- cech et al., 1996 Smits et al., 1999). Our results provide an explanation for the bud-scar/birth-scar asymmetry after cell division: upon cell separation, daughter-spe- cific expression of Cts1 and these other proteins de- grades material on the daughter-proximal side of the septum and causes the birth scar.
The remaining mate- rial on the mother-proximal side of the septum is unde- graded, and forms the bud scar.
A Possible Cytokinesis Checkpoint Why does Ace2 need to be activated by Cbk1/Mob2 Our findings indicate that daughter-specific gene ex- pression leads to the degradation of the connecting septum, followed by cell separation (see below). We found that Cbk1 and Mob2 localized to the bud neck just when Ace2 began to accumulate in the daughter nucleus, suggesting that Cbk1/Mob2 movement to the bud neck might trigger Ace2 movement to the nucleus.
The Cbk1 and Mob2 proteins would thus appear suited to transduce a signal indicating the completion of mem- brane fission in the bud neck.
We propose that this Cbk1/Mob2 signal is part of a cytokinesis checkpoint that ensures that cell wall degradation does not com- mence until membrane fission is completed.
In this model, at the end of mitosis, Ace2 would integrate a cell cycle and a morphogenic signal.
Systematizable Methods to Identify Programs of Gene Expression We have identified programs of gene expression spe- cific to daughter cells.
Some of the methods that en- abled these findings deserve mention.
First, we made extensive use of fluorescent protein reporters to look among many candidate promoters to find those which were in fact daughter-specific.
Second, in two cases, we identified sets of candidate daughter-specific genes by the fact that they were coregulated under other, seemingly irrelevant, circumstances, and in response to other, seemingly irrelevant, perturbations.
This ability to reexamine preexisting expression data is potentially quite useful.
We suspect that enough published gene expression data now exists to identify other genetic programs involved in other processes by coregulation Table 3.

All were derived from W303a as de- scribed in the Experimental Procedures and the Supplemental Ex- perimental Procedures at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/107 6/739/DC1. under seemingly unrelated circumstances.
Moreover, as the quantity of expression data collected for other purposes, or even collected without reference to any hypothesis, increases, the utility of irrelevant coregula- tion to identify new programs and pathways should also increase.
Relevance to Other Organisms Cell fate asymmetry in budding yeast is regulated by mother-specific transcription of HO and by daughter- specific programs described here.
These results cannot exclude the idea that there may be still other asymmetric processes that regulate events specific to mothers, daughters, and, perhaps (in light of our findings with Ash1), granddaughters.
The proteins that govern the daughter-specific proteins, the kinase Cbk1, Mob2, and the transcription factor Ace2, have homologs in other organisms.
It would not be surprising to find that these proteins regulate asymmetric cell division and lineage determination in higher eukaryotes.
Experimental Procedures Genetic and Molecular Biological Methods Nucleic acid and yeast manipulations were performed as described (Ausubel et al., 1987 Guthrie and Fink, 1991). Yeast Strains and Plasmids Strains are detailed in Table 3.
YAS245-5C (can1::HO-CAN1 ho::HO- ADE2 ura3 ade2 leu2 trp1 his3) is a W303a derivative (Anita Sil, personal communication). Other strains in Table 3 derive from YAS245-5C. Construction, by standard techniques, is detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures at http://www.cell.com cgi/content/full/107/6/739/DC1. We constructed YFP reporter plasmids as follows.
We isolated a KpnI-BamHI fragment containing PGAL1, the EcoRI and XhoI sites, and the ADH1 terminator from pJG4-4 (Geyer et al., 1999) and intro- duced it into pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) to generate pACL7. We made YFP by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the GFP sequence from A. victoria and introduced the gene into pACL7 to make pACL7-YFP. We removed the PGAL1 fragment to make a plasmid backbone into which we introduced fragments containing other promoters.
Details of these constructions are given in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Daughter-Specific Genetic Programs in Yeast 749 Growth Conditions and Cell Cycle Arrest To test promoter expression patterns, we first grew colonies bearing the appropriate plasmids or integrated constructs overnight in BSM (QBiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) 2% glucose.
We then diluted these cultures to OD600 0.1 in BSM 2% raffinose and allowed them to grow to OD600 0.5 at 30 C, then prepared the cells for microscopy.
The slow growth of cells on raffinose allows YFP synthesized during late M/early G1 to be degraded before the next round of cell division (in our hands, the half-life of YFP is approximately 2 hr see Supplemen- tal Experimental Procedures). To determine the pattern of expres- sion in saturated cultures, we diluted overnight cultures to OD600 0.1 in BSM 2% (w/v) glucose and allowed the cultures to grow to OD600 5 (ⵑ108 cells/ml) at 30 C before examination.
Since YFP fluores- cence is very low on standard (pH 5.0) synthetic medium, to image secreted Cts1-YFP in ACLY362 cells, we shifted exponentially grow- ing cells to synthetic medium equilibrated to pH 7 for 2 hr before observation.
To synchronize cells, we arrested them with  factor as described (Futcher, 1999). Briefly, we diluted overnight cultures to OD600 0.08 in BSM 2% glucose and grew them to OD600 0.3 at 30 C. At this point we added 3 M  factor.
As judged by microscopic observa- tion, cells were arrested and shmooing 90 min later.
We removed  factor by filtration and rinsing, resuspended the cells in fresh BSM 2% glucose medium, and took samples every 10 min.
Imaging We fixed cells for fluorescent microscopy by adding paraformalde- hyde (pH 7.2) to 2% for 1 hr on ice.
We washed the cells in PBS twice before examination.
To image living cells, we directly mounted samples in growing medium.
To stain DNA or chitin, we added DAPI (100 ng/ml) or calcofluor (100 ng/ml), respectively, just before mounting.
We determined GFP and YFP fluorescence using the Piston GFP and the HQ YFP filter set (sets 41025 and 41028 from Chroma Tech- nologies Corp, Brattleboro, VT), respectively.
We imaged DAPI and calcofluor using the DAPI filter set (set 31000 from Chroma). We captured and analyzed images using a SPOT2e CCD camera (Diag- nostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) coupled to MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). For time-lapse photomicroscopy, we mounted living cells on 2% agarose pads prepared in BSM with 2% glucose and took 2 s expo- sures at 2 min intervals over a period of 2 hr.
We quantified the fluorescence from the resulting images and computed YFP-based fluorescence at each time as follows.
First, we measured YFP photo- bleaching by imaging wt cells containing but not expressing new YFP for 2 s out of 4 s, over 240 s. These cells contained YFP under the control of the GAL1 promoter we regulated the initial YFP level by shifting exponentially growing cells from 2% glucose to 2% raffi- nose, 1% galactose for three hours, followed by a return to 2% glucose for 30 min before imaging.
We observed autofluorescence photobleaching by imaging cells lacking YFP for 2 s, every 4 s, over 240 s as above.
We obtained the photobleaching function,   0.071  0.977e 0.06t, where t is the single image exposure time in seconds, by fitting the net fluorescence data (YFP minus autofluore- scence) from these experiments to an offset exponential function (R2  0.9978). We then quantified the amount of YFP in the nucleus of individual cells in a visual field using the formula YFPi  YFPi 1  [(Obsi  Autoi)  (Obsi 1  Autoi 1)], where YFPi and YFPi 1 are the computed YFP-based fluorescence at times i and i 1, respectively, Obsi and Obsi 1 are the total observed fluorescence at times i and i 1, respectively, Autoi and Autoi 1 are the observed autofluorescence (fluorescence from cells in the field that do not contain YFP) at times i and i 1, respectively, and  is the fraction of YFP fluorescence remaining after photobleaching. Interaction Mating We tested the interaction between LexA-Mob2 and Ace21 449 and Cbk1 in interaction mating two-hybrid experiments using the LexAop-lacZ reporter pSH18-34 essentially as described (Finley and Brent, 1994). Analysis of Gene Expression Data We obtained cell cycle (Spellman et al., 1998) and response to gene deletion (Hughes et al., 2000) gene expression data directly from http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle and http://www.rii.com publications/cell_hughes.htm. We clustered the raw data using the Cluster software (Eisen et al., 1998). We obtained data already clus- tered by Gasch et al. (2000) for the response of yeast to different environmental conditions from http://genome-www.stanford.edu yeast_stress Acknowledgments We are grateful to Gustavo Pesce, Drew Endy, Eric Lyons, Orna Resnekov, Eduard Serra, Larry Lok, Ian Burbulis, Ivgueni Kroll, Andy Mendelsohn, and Sydney Brenner for their advice and comments, to Anita Sil for providing yeast strains, and to Kevan Shokat for chemical kinase inhibitors.
