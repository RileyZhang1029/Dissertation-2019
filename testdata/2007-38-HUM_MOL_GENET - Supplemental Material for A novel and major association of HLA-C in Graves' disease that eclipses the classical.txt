Microsoft Word-ddm165supp.doc    1 Supplementary information Geography At each locus we examined the geographical variation in allele frequency by multinomial logistic regression, to check if we were justified in pooling all three case groups. We detected a significant variation in allele frequency between the case cohorts at HLA-C, P = 0.0008, supplementary Tables 1 and 2. We also tested whether the Midlands were different to the pooled South and Southwest case groups, again HLA-C was different, P = 0.002, Supplementary Table 1. The difference in allele frequency in our collection is attributable to HLA-C*03, which is less frequent in the southern regions than in the Midlands.

For the other loci there was no evidence to suggest that allele frequency varied between centres of collection therefore we report here the results in the full dataset of 1,571 individuals.
