ABSTRACT

A taxonomic revision of the genus Pastinaca L. was carried out with respect to fruit
macro-  and  micro-morphology,  anatomy,  palynology,  and  phytochemistry.  The
study covers the world distribution of the genus, confined to Europe and Asia, except
for Pastinaca sativa L. subsp. sativa (parsnip) cultivated all over the world. Pollen
studies showed that the pollen of the genus could be described as cerebroid. Three
flavonoid  compounds  were  detected  in  the  genus.  Pastinaca  is  represented  with
eight  species  and  four  subspecies  in  the  world.  P.  latifolia  DC.  is  regarded  as  a
subspecies of P. sativa.

INTRODUCTION

The  name  Pastinaca  originated  from  the  Latin  word
pastus, food, referring to the edible root which has been
known for a long time. Tournefort (1694, 1700) gave a
drawing  of  an  Umbellifereae  plant  named  Pastinaca
which was adopted by Linneaus (1753). Miller (1731–
1732)  mentioned  three  names:  Pastinaca  sativa
latifolia,  P.  sylvestris  latifolia,  and  P.  sylvestris
altissima.  These  were  changed  to  binomial  names  by
Linneaus (1753): Pastinaca sativa var. sylvestris, P. sativa
var.  sativa,  and  P.  opopanax,  respectively.  Adanson
(1763)  was  the  first  to  combine  Umbelliferae
(Umbellatae) with Araliaceae and recognized nine sec-
tions  in  the  family,  putting  the  genus  in  Pastinacae.
Bieberstein (1808), Bernhard (1815), and De Candolle
(1830)  studied  the  genus.  Boissier  (1872)  recognized
three  subsections  in  the  genus  using  the  habit,  bract,
bracteole,  and  petal  characters,  and  introduced  three
new  species.  Calestani  (1905)  combined  the  genera
Pastinaca,  Malabaila,  Heracleum,  Zosima,
Lophotaenia,  Ainsworthia,  Wendiana,  and  Tordylium
under the genus name Pastinaca. He divided the genus
into  six  sections.  Koso-Poljansky  (1916)  slightly
changed  Calestani’s  work,  recognizing  two  sections,
seven subsections, and two groups. However, this taxo-

nomic treatment was not followed by any other taxono-
mist. Schischkin (1951), in Flora of the USSR, followed
Boissier’s treatment of 1872.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Morphology

Around 250 specimens were obtained on loan from the
main herbaria in England and throughout Europe. Some
species were examined in the field and also under culti-
vation  in  the  University  of  Reading  greenhouses.  The
specimens were examined and the measurements were
made using a microscope and micrometer or ruler. Some
characters  (plant  height,  corolla  color,  and  flowering
time) were also taken from the literature (Gertsberger,
1995) or from labels on the herbarium sheets, whenever
it  was  not  possible  to  observe  them  directly  from  the
specimens.

Palynology

The pollen grains were obtained from herbarium speci-
mens. Several unopened buds (to make sure alien pollen
grains were not present) were placed in a watch glass, a

few  drops  of  wetting  agent  added,  and  squashed.  The
acetolysis mixture was added with a bulb pipette to the
dry pollen in the watch glass on the heating block. When
the pollen grains darkened, they were allowed to cool
for a few minutes and methylated spirit was added drop
by drop to the center  of the remaining acetolysis mix-
ture. The acetolysis mixture formed a ring around the
rim of the watchglass and was wiped away with a tissue.
The  pollen  grains  were  transferred  to  copper  stubs,
which  were  already  prepared  with  double-sided  adhe-
sive  tape  for  SEM  (Scanning  Electron  Microscopy)
study.  For  preparing  light  microscope  slides,  the  re-
maining pollen grains in the watch glasses were trans-
ferred to the slides using glycerine jelly with safranine
stain  added.  When  the  glycerine  jelly  melted  on  the
heating  block,  cover  slips  were  added.  For  the  SEM
study, stubs were coated with gold for 5–6 minutes. The
measurements were carried out using light microscopy.
At least 20 pollen grains were measured from each slide.

Phytochemistry

Two  dried  fruits  from  each  sample  were  crushed  and
placed in a test tube, covered with 80% methanol, and
placed in a heating block at 70 °C for about 20 min. Half
of each extract was decanted into a watchglass in a fume
cupboard and left to evaporate to dryness. The extracts
were  dissolved  in  a  few  drops  of  80%  methanol  and
spotted  onto  Whatman  No.  1  chromatography  paper
(size  approx.  22  ×  22  cm)  with  rutin  (quercetin  3-
rutinoside) as a marker, in accordance with the method
of Harborne (1998) and run in BAW (n-butanol: acetic
acid: water) for five h. The papers were dried in a fume
cupboard and trimmed, the rutin spot marked, and the
paper refolded along the axis of the first separation run.
The  rutin  marker  was  re-spotted  on  the  origin  of  the
original methanolic extract and the papers were re-run
in  15%  acetic  acid  for  about  2  h  and  dried  in  a  fume
cupboard.  The  glycoside  spots  were  examined  in  UV
light  and  their  position  and  color  reactions  recorded
before and after fuming with ammonia. Rf values were
recorded. The remaining methanolic extracts in the test
tubes were hydrolyzed with 2 M HCl for 40 min in a
water bath at 100 °C. After cooling, hydrolyzates were
extracted  with  ethyl  acetate  and  the  ethyl  acetate  ex-
tracts evaporated to dryness in a fume cupboard over-
night.  The  dried  extracts  were  re-dissolved  in  100%
methanol and spotted onto TLC cellulose plates and run
one-dimensionally in the following solvents:

1. BAW (n-butanol:acetic acid:water, 4:1:5).
2. CAW (chloroform:acetic acid:water, 30:15:2).
3. Forestral (acetic acid:water:conc. HCl, 30:15:2).
4. 50% acetic acid.

Quercetin,  isorhamnetin,  kaempferol,  luteolin,  and
chrysoeriol were used as markers alongside the extracts,
and the plates were run for 45–60 minutes depending on
the  solvent.  The  plates  were  sprayed  with  diphenyl-
borinic acid ethanolamine ester (Naturstoffreagenz A) in
methanol  and  re-examined.  The  color  changes  and  Rf
values helped in the identification of the aglycones.

MORPHOLOGY

Longevity and seasonality
The genus consists of biennial and perennial herbs. All
species  have  taproots.  The  flowering  period  generally
starts in June and continues throughout October, except
for P. lucida, which flowers in April.
Stem and indumentum
The height of the plants varies from 25 cm to 200 (300)
cm. The stem is erect and straight in all species, but in
Pastinaca zozimoides it is angled. The stem surface is
generally deeply sulcate if the shape is angled in cross
section and striate or slightly sulcate when it is terete.
Some  species,  such  as  Pastinaca  lucida  and  P.  zozi-
moides, produce a strong fibrous collar just above the
root. The rest of the species very rarely produce a strong
fibrous collar. The stem is hairy in all species except for
Pastinaca lucida, which is glabrous.
Leaves
The basal leaves are of taxonomic value, but heteromor-
phism in leaf form has caused problems in taxonomic
descriptions  and  identification  of  the  species.  For  ex-
ample, the specimens of Pastinaca lucida grown in the
glasshouse produced simple leaves in the first two years,
but in their third year started to give 1-pinnate leaves.
They also changed their shape from palmate to ovate-

triangular.  The  general  tendency  in  Pastinaca  is  for
leaves  to  be  1-pinnate,  but  P.  fleischmanni,
P.  zozimoides,  and  sometimes  P.  pimpinellifolia  are
2-pinnate. The leaves are alternate and have a distinct
petiole.  The  bases  of  the  petioles  have  sheaths  with
membranous  margins.  The  outline  leaf  shape  ranges
from oblong to triangular. The size range is 35–400 ×
13–200 mm. The primary leaf segment number is gener-
ally  3–7.  The  shape  of  the  primary  segments  changes
from oblong to triangular with serrate or lobed margin.
The indumentum of the leaves is very similar to that of
the stem, hairy on both side but glabrous in P. lucida.

Umbels

In the genera examined, two types of compound umbels
are seen: if three lateral umbels branch from the same
node at the top of the plant, it is called here a complex
compound  umbel;  if  the  lateral  umbels  are  branched
alternately (raceme), then it is called a simple compound
umbel. The general tendency is to form a complex um-
bel type, although some plants do not always produce it.
However,  most  of  the  specimens  examined  from
Pastinaca  hirsuta,  P.  armena,  and  P.  zozimoides
showed simple compound umbels.

The diameter of the umbels ranges from 20 mm to
150  mm,  and  species  are  generally  equal  or  subequal
and very rarely unequal, as in Pastinaca fleischmanni
and P. armena. The number of the rays varies from 3
to 22.

Bracts

Bracts  are  generally  present  in  Pastinaca  hirsuta,
P. pimpinellifolia, and P. armena. They range from 1 to
6  in  number  and  3–17  mm  in  length.  The  shape  is
generally linear or linear-lanceolate, hairy with a ciliate
margin,  except  for  Pastinaca  pimpinellifolia  and
P. armena which are sometimes glabrous.

Bracteoles

Bracteoles  are  not  present  in  Pastinaca  fleischmanni,
P. lucida, P. sativa subsp. sativa, P. sativa subsp. urens,

P.  sativa  subsp.  sylvestris,  P.  divaricata,  and
P. zozimoides. The length of the bracteoles ranges from
2 to 6 in number and 3–10 mm in length. The shape is
generally linear or linear-lanceolate, and they are hairy
with entire or ciliate margins.

Sepals

Sepal teeth are absent or minute in all species.

Petals

The  petal  is  yellow  to  greenish-yellow,  except  for
P.  zozimoides  in  which  it  is  pinkish,  with  or  without
brown  veins.  The  corolla  is  actinomorphic  and  very
small, ranging from 1.2 to 2.5 mm. The petal is gener-
ally glabrous, except for P. hirsuta, P. pimpinellifolia,
P. armena, P. divaricata, and P. zozimoides.

Fruit macro-morphology (Figs. 1,2)

The fruits are dorsally compressed, appearing to show a
general  tendency  towards  elliptic.  The  fruit  length  is
between 3.5 and 7 mm. The style is curved in almost all
species. It is generally glabrous except for P. armena.
The apex of mericarp is not or only very slightly emar-
ginate.

(Magnification × 3000).

Fruit micro-morphology (Fig. 3)

The SEM study shows that all cells on the dorsal surface
are hexagonal and form a reticulate pattern. The surface
between the two ribs in the species is striate. The margin
of  the  mericarp  surface  is  very  similar  to  that  of  the
surface  between  the  two  ribs.  The  dorsal  surface  in
Pastinaca armena is glabrous. In the rest of the species
it  is  hairy.  Although  P.  hirsuta,  P.  pimpinellifolia,
P. lucida, P. sativa subsp. sativa, P. sativa subsp. urens,
and P. sativa subsp. sylvestris appeared to be glabrous
under the dissection microscope, the SEM study showed
that these plants have very short triangular hairs on the
dorsal surface of the mericarp. The hairs have a papil-
lose  surface  which  is  unique  to  the  genus  within  the
umbellifers. P. zozimoides is the only one with ribbon-
type hairs which are papillose and with a vertical corru-
gated surface. The commisural surface in P. divaricata
is  waxy,  and  the  remaining  species  are  glabrous  or
subglabrous.

ANATOMY OF MERICARP (Fig. 2)

The number of dorsal vittae in the genus Pastinaca is
generally four. There is only one vitta between the two
dorsal ribs. The number of commisural vittae is 2, very
rarely 4–6 as in P. sativa subsp. latifolia. The shapes of
vittae  in  cross  section  vary  from  rounded  to  elliptic,
upside or downside crescent. There are 3 dorsal ribs and
2  lateral  ones.  They  are  all  generally  filiform  on  the
upper surface. There is also one very distinct commis-
ural rib (carpophore). All taxa have a lateral wing with a

neck. Exocarp layers range from one to five. The num-
ber of the mesocarp parenchyma cell layers varies from
one  to  six.  The  genus  has  a  very  distinctive  woody
lignified  endocarp  layer  which  holds  the  red  color  of
safranin  when  stained.  This  layer  extends  through  the
wings where it connects with the lateral rib bundles. The
number of lignified endocarp layers is between one and
four.

PALYNOLOGY

The  present  study  showed  that  the  genus  Pastinaca
generally has oval pollen grains except for P. hirsuta,
where  they  are  slightly  subrhomboid.  There  are  three
inner and outer contours which are generally different
from each other. The three inner and outer contours are:
straight, slightly or distinctly curved, and convex. The
poles are generally rounded, but are sligthly angled in
P.  pimpinellifolia.  Polar,  equatorial  axes,  nexine  and
sexine width, pore height, and colpi length were mea-
sured for at least 20 grains of each sample (see Table 1).
The pollen surface is cerebroid in the genus (except for
P. sativa subsp. urens).

PHYTOCHEMISTRY

The fruit flavonoid patterns of 11 taxa were investigated
(see Table 2). After acid hydrolysis of the crude methan-
olic extracts of the taxa surveyed, three flavonol agly-
cones  (isorhamnetin,  kaempferol,  and  quercetin)  were
found. The flavonol aglycone isorhamnetin was found
to occur in all the taxa except P. zozimoides, which is the

kaempferol had a scattered occurrence in the genus.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Although previous taxonomists treated Pastinaca in dif-
ferent ways, it was seen that the genus could be sepa-
rated from other closely related genera in several ways
using macro-morphology, micromorphology, anatomy,
or palynology. The pollen study showed that the pollen
surface is cerebroid in the genus Pastinaca (except for
P. sativa subsp. urens). Micromorphology studies of the
mericarp by SEM showed that the genus Pastinaca is
also distinguished by very short triangular hairs (which
are also papillose) on the dorsal surface of the mericarp.
The flavonol aglycone isorhamnetin was found to occur
in all the taxa, except P. zozimoides which is the only
species  in  the  genus  with  kaempferol.  The  genus  is
found  to  contain  eight  species  and  four  subspecies.
Pastinaca latifolia DC. is regarded as a subspecies of
P.  sativa  (see  Taxonomic  treatment  for  synonyms).
Boissier (1872) suggested that P. glandulosa Boiss. &

Hausskn. ex Boiss. belonged to Pastinaca on account of
its smell and appearance, but obviously still had some
doubt because he gave a question mark with the genus
name. Unfortunately, the type specimen has no fruit and
is  incomplete  and  it  is  impossible  to  confirm  this.
P.  aurantiaca  (Alb.)  Kolak.  and  P.  chrysantha  (Alb.)
K.-Pol.  have  no  mature  fruit  on  their  type  specimens,
but look like Malabaila dasyantha (C. Koch) Grossh.,
var.  dasyantha  in  their  vegetative  and  floral  features.
Therefore, the taxonomic positions of these three speci-
mens also cannot be determined.
