JURYb aBiology Department, Faculty of Science and Literature, Kirikkale University, Kirikkale, Turkey bDepartment of Botany, Plant Science Laboratories, The University of Reading, P.O.
Box 221, Whiteknights, Reading Berkshire, RG6 2AS, UK (Received 6 March 2000; and in revised form 14 June 2000) ABSTRACT A taxonomic revision of the genus Pastinaca L. was carried out with respect to fruit macro-and micro-morphology, anatomy, palynology, and phytochemistry.
The study covers the world distribution of the genus, confined to Europe and Asia, except for Pastinaca sativa L. subsp.
sativa (parsnip) cultivated all over the world.
Pollen studies showed that the pollen of the genus could be described as cerebroid.
Three flavonoid compounds were detected in the genus.
Pastinaca is represented with eight species and four subspecies in the world.
P. latifolia DC.
is regarded as a subspecies of P. sativa.
INTRODUCTION The name Pastinaca originated from the Latin word pastus, food, referring to the edible root which has been known for a long time.
Tournefort (1694, 1700) gave a drawing of an Umbellifereae plant named Pastinaca which was adopted by Linneaus (1753).
Miller (1731 1732) mentioned three names: Pastinaca sativa latifolia, P. sylvestris latifolia, and P. sylvestris altissima.
These were changed to binomial names by Linneaus (1753): Pastinaca sativa var.
sylvestris, P. sativa var.
sativa, and P. opopanax, respectively.
Adanson (1763) was the first to combine Umbelliferae (Umbellatae) with Araliaceae and recognized nine sections in the family, putting the genus in Pastinacae.
Bieberstein (1808), Bernhard (1815), and De Candolle (1830) studied the genus.
Boissier (1872) recognized three subsections in the genus using the habit, bract, bracteole, and petal characters, and introduced three new species.
Calestani (1905) combined the genera Pastinaca, Malabaila, Heracleum, Zosima, Lophotaenia, Ainsworthia, Wendiana, and Tordylium under the genus name Pastinaca.
He divided the genus into six sections.
Koso-Poljansky (1916) slightly changed Calestanis work, recognizing two sections, seven subsections, and two groups.
However, this taxo nomic treatment was not followed by any other taxonomist.
Schischkin (1951), in Flora of the USSR, followed Boissiers treatment of 1872.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Morphology Around 250 specimens were obtained on loan from the main herbaria in England and throughout Europe.
Some species were examined in the field and also under cultivation in the University of Reading greenhouses.
The specimens were examined and the measurements were made using a microscope and micrometer or ruler.
Some characters (plant height, corolla color, and flowering time) were also taken from the literature (Gertsberger, 1995) or from labels on the herbarium sheets, whenever it was not possible to observe them directly from the specimens.
Palynology The pollen grains were obtained from herbarium specimens.
Several unopened buds (to make sure alien pollen grains were not present) were placed in a watch glass, a Israel Journal of Plant Sciences 49 2001 68 few drops of wetting agent added, and squashed.
The acetolysis mixture was added with a bulb pipette to the dry pollen in the watch glass on the heating block.
When the pollen grains darkened, they were allowed to cool for a few minutes and methylated spirit was added drop by drop to the center of the remaining acetolysis mixture.
The acetolysis mixture formed a ring around the rim of the watchglass and was wiped away with a tissue.
The pollen grains were transferred to copper stubs, which were already prepared with double-sided adhesive tape for SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) study.
For preparing light microscope slides, the remaining pollen grains in the watch glasses were transferred to the slides using glycerine jelly with safranine stain added.
When the glycerine jelly melted on the heating block, cover slips were added.
For the SEM study, stubs were coated with gold for 56 minutes.
The measurements were carried out using light microscopy.
At least 20 pollen grains were measured from each slide.
Phytochemistry Two dried fruits from each sample were crushed and placed in a test tube, covered with 80% methanol, and placed in a heating block at 70 C for about 20 min.
Half of each extract was decanted into a watchglass in a fume cupboard and left to evaporate to dryness.
The extracts were dissolved in a few drops of 80% methanol and spotted onto Whatman No.
1 chromatography paper (size approx.
22 22 cm) with rutin (quercetin 3rutinoside) as a marker, in accordance with the method of Harborne (1998) and run in BAW (n-butanol: acetic acid: water) for five h. The papers were dried in a fume cupboard and trimmed, the rutin spot marked, and the paper refolded along the axis of the first separation run.
The rutin marker was re-spotted on the origin of the original methanolic extract and the papers were re-run in 15% acetic acid for about 2 h and dried in a fume cupboard.
The glycoside spots were examined in UV light and their position and color reactions recorded before and after fuming with ammonia.
R f values were recorded.
The remaining methanolic extracts in the test tubes were hydrolyzed with 2 M HCl for 40 min in a water bath at 100 C. After cooling, hydrolyzates were extracted with ethyl acetate and the ethyl acetate extracts evaporated to dryness in a fume cupboard overnight.
The dried extracts were re-dissolved in 100% methanol and spotted onto TLC cellulose plates and run one-dimensionally in the following solvents: 1.
BAW (n-butanol:acetic acid:water, 4:1:5).
2.
CAW (chloroform:acetic acid:water, 30:15:2).
3.
Forestral (acetic acid:water:conc.
HCl, 30:15:2).
4.
50% acetic acid.
Quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and chrysoeriol were used as markers alongside the extracts, and the plates were run for 4560 minutes depending on the solvent.
The plates were sprayed with diphenylborinic acid ethanolamine ester (Naturstoffreagenz A) in methanol and re-examined.
The color changes and R f values helped in the identification of the aglycones.

MORPHOLOGY Longevity and seasonality The genus consists of biennial and perennial herbs.
All species have taproots.
The flowering period generally starts in June and continues throughout October, except for P. lucida, which flowers in April.
Stem and indumentum The height of the plants varies from 25 cm to 200 (300) cm.
The stem is erect and straight in all species, but in Pastinaca zozimoides it is angled.
The stem surface is generally deeply sulcate if the shape is angled in cross section and striate or slightly sulcate when it is terete.
Some species, such as Pastinaca lucida and P. zozimoides, produce a strong fibrous collar just above the root.
The rest of the species very rarely produce a strong fibrous collar.
The stem is hairy in all species except for Pastinaca lucida, which is glabrous.
Leaves The basal leaves are of taxonomic value, but heteromorphism in leaf form has caused problems in taxonomic descriptions and identification of the species.
For example, the specimens of Pastinaca lucida grown in the glasshouse produced simple leaves in the first two years, but in their third year started to give 1-pinnate leaves.
They also changed their shape from palmate to ovate Menemen and Jury/Taxonomic revision of Pastinaca L. (Umbelliferae) 69 triangular.
The general tendency in Pastinaca is for leaves to be 1-pinnate, but P. fleischmanni, P. zozimoides, and sometimes P. pimpinellifolia are 2-pinnate.
The leaves are alternate and have a distinct petiole.
The bases of the petioles have sheaths with membranous margins.
The outline leaf shape ranges from oblong to triangular.
The size range is 35400 13200 mm.
The primary leaf segment number is generally 37.
The shape of the primary segments changes from oblong to triangular with serrate or lobed margin.
The indumentum of the leaves is very similar to that of the stem, hairy on both side but glabrous in P. lucida.
Umbels In the genera examined, two types of compound umbels are seen: if three lateral umbels branch from the same node at the top of the plant, it is called here a complex compound umbel; if the lateral umbels are branched alternately (raceme), then it is called a simple compound umbel.
The general tendency is to form a complex umbel type, although some plants do not always produce it.
However, most of the specimens examined from Pastinaca hirsuta, P. armena, and P. zozimoides showed simple compound umbels.
The diameter of the umbels ranges from 20 mm to 150 mm, and species are generally equal or subequal and very rarely unequal, as in Pastinaca fleischmanni and P. armena.
The number of the rays varies from 3 to 22.
Bracts Bracts are generally present in Pastinaca hirsuta, P. pimpinellifolia, and P. armena.
They range from 1 to 6 in number and 317 mm in length.
The shape is generally linear or linear-lanceolate, hairy with a ciliate margin, except for Pastinaca pimpinellifolia and P. armena which are sometimes glabrous.
Bracteoles Bracteoles are not present in Pastinaca fleischmanni, P. lucida, P. sativa subsp.
sativa, P. sativa subsp.
urens, P. sativa subsp.
sylvestris, P. divaricata, and P. zozimoides.
The length of the bracteoles ranges from 2 to 6 in number and 310 mm in length.
The shape is generally linear or linear-lanceolate, and they are hairy with entire or ciliate margins.
Sepals Sepal teeth are absent or minute in all species.
Petals The petal is yellow to greenish-yellow, except for P. zozimoides in which it is pinkish, with or without brown veins.
The corolla is actinomorphic and very small, ranging from 1.2 to 2.5 mm.
The petal is generally glabrous, except for P. hirsuta, P. pimpinellifolia, P. armena, P. divaricata, and P. zozimoides.
Fruit macro-morphology (Figs.
1,2) The fruits are dorsally compressed, appearing to show a general tendency towards elliptic.
The fruit length is between 3.5 and 7 mm.
The style is curved in almost all species.
It is generally glabrous except for P. armena.
The apex of mericarp is not or only very slightly emarginate.

Scale bar = 1 mm.
A B Israel Journal of Plant Sciences 49 2001 70 Fruit micro-morphology (Fig.3) The SEM study shows that all cells on the dorsal surface are hexagonal and form a reticulate pattern.
The surface between the two ribs in the species is striate.
The margin of the mericarp surface is very similar to that of the surface between the two ribs.
The dorsal surface in Pastinaca armena is glabrous.
In the rest of the species it is hairy.
Although P. hirsuta, P. pimpinellifolia, P. lucida, P. sativa subsp.
sativa, P. sativa subsp.
urens, and P. sativa subsp.
sylvestris appeared to be glabrous under the dissection microscope, the SEM study showed that these plants have very short triangular hairs on the dorsal surface of the mericarp.
The hairs have a papillose surface which is unique to the genus within the umbellifers.
P. zozimoides is the only one with ribbontype hairs which are papillose and with a vertical corrugated surface.
The commisural surface in P. divaricata is waxy, and the remaining species are glabrous or subglabrous.
ANATOMY OF MERICARP (Fig.2) The number of dorsal vittae in the genus Pastinaca is generally four.
There is only one vitta between the two dorsal ribs.
The number of commisural vittae is 2, very rarely 46 as in P. sativa subsp.
latifolia.
The shapes of vittae in cross section vary from rounded to elliptic, upside or downside crescent.
There are 3 dorsal ribs and 2 lateral ones.
They are all generally filiform on the upper surface.
There is also one very distinct commisural rib (carpophore).
All taxa have a lateral wing with a neck.
Exocarp layers range from one to five.
The number of the mesocarp parenchyma cell layers varies from one to six.
The genus has a very distinctive woody lignified endocarp layer which holds the red color of safranin when stained.
This layer extends through the wings where it connects with the lateral rib bundles.
The number of lignified endocarp layers is between one and four.
PALYNOLOGY The present study showed that the genus Pastinaca generally has oval pollen grains except for P. hirsuta, where they are slightly subrhomboid.
There are three inner and outer contours which are generally different from each other.
The three inner and outer contours are: straight, slightly or distinctly curved, and convex.
The poles are generally rounded, but are sligthly angled in P. pimpinellifolia.
Polar, equatorial axes, nexine and sexine width, pore height, and colpi length were measured for at least 20 grains of each sample (see Table 1).
The pollen surface is cerebroid in the genus (except for P. sativa subsp.
urens).
PHYTOCHEMISTRY The fruit flavonoid patterns of 11 taxa were investigated (see Table 2).
After acid hydrolysis of the crude methanolic extracts of the taxa surveyed, three flavonol aglycones (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin) were found.
The flavonol aglycone isorhamnetin was found to occur in all the taxa except P. zozimoides, which is the Fig.3.

divaricata between the two ribs on dorsal surface of a mericarp (Magnification 840).

Menemen and Jury/Taxonomic revision of Pastinaca L. (Umbelliferae) 71 only species in the genus with kaempferol.
The aglycone kaempferol had a scattered occurrence in the genus.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Although previous taxonomists treated Pastinaca in different ways, it was seen that the genus could be separated from other closely related genera in several ways using macro-morphology, micromorphology, anatomy, or palynology.
The pollen study showed that the pollen surface is cerebroid in the genus Pastinaca (except for P. sativa subsp.
urens).
Micromorphology studies of the mericarp by SEM showed that the genus Pastinaca is also distinguished by very short triangular hairs (which are also papillose) on the dorsal surface of the mericarp.
The flavonol aglycone isorhamnetin was found to occur in all the taxa, except P. zozimoides which is the only species in the genus with kaempferol.
The genus is found to contain eight species and four subspecies.
Pastinaca latifolia DC.
is regarded as a subspecies of P. sativa (see Taxonomic treatment for synonyms).
Boissier (1872) suggested that P. glandulosa Boiss.
& Hausskn.
ex Boiss.
belonged to Pastinaca on account of its smell and appearance, but obviously still had some doubt because he gave a question mark with the genus name.
Unfortunately, the type specimen has no fruit and is incomplete and it is impossible to confirm this.
P. aurantiaca (Alb.)
Kolak.
and P. chrysantha (Alb.)
K.-Pol.
have no mature fruit on their type specimens, but look like Malabaila dasyantha (C. Koch) Grossh., var.
dasyantha in their vegetative and floral features.
Therefore, the taxonomic positions of these three specimens also cannot be determined.
