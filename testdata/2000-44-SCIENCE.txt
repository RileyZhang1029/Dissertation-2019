We injected lenti-GDNF into the striatum and substantia nigra of nonlesioned aged rhesus monkeys or young adult rhesus monkeys treated 1 week prior with 1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Extensive GDNF expression with antero- grade and retrograde transport was seen in all animals.
In aged monkeys, lenti-GDNF augmented dopaminergic function.
In MPTP-treated monkeys, lenti-GDNF reversed functional de(cid:222)cits and completely prevented nigrostriatal degeneration.
Additionally, lenti-GDNF injections to intact rhesus monkeys revealed long-term gene expression (8 months). In MPTP-treated monkeys, lenti-GDNF treatment reversed motor de(cid:222)cits in a hand-reach task.
These data indicate that GDNF delivery using a lentiviral vector system can prevent ni- grostriatal degeneration and induce regeneration in primate models of PD and might be a viable therapeutic strategy for PD patients.
Parkinson s disease is a progressive disorder resulting from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Surgical therapies aimed at replacing lost dopaminer- gic neurons or disrupting aberrant basal gan- glia circuitry have recently been tested (1). However, these clinical trials have focused on patients with advanced disease, and the primary goal of forestalling disease progres- sion in newly diagnosed patients has yet to be realized.
Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has potent trophic effects on dopa- minergic nigral neurons (2 8), suggesting that this factor could provide neuroprotection 1Department of Neurological Sciences and 5Depart- ment of Pharmacology, Rush Presbyterian St. Luke(cid:213)s Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. 2Division of Surgical Research and Gene Therapy Center, Lausanne University Medical School, Lausanne, Switzerland. 3Department of Medical Physics and 4Department of Radiology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA. 6Department of Genetics and Microbiol- ogy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Ge- neva, Switzerland. 7Commissariat a l(cid:213)Energie Atom- ique (CEA), CNRS, Unite de Recherche Associe (URA), 2210 Service Hospitalier Frederic Joliot, CEA, Direc- tion des Sciences du Vivant (DSV), Departement de Recherche Medicale (DRM), Orsay cedex, France. 8Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, EPFL, Lau- sanne, Switzerland. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We have shown that intraventricular administration of GDNF failed to improve clinical function or prevent nigrostriatal degeneration in a patient with PD, and this failure resulted from an ineffec- tive delivery method (9). Gene therapy is a powerful means to deliver trophic molecules to the central nervous system in a site-specif- ic manner.
Robust transfer of marker and therapeutic genes has recently been demon- strated in the rodent and nonhuman primate brain with the use of a lentiviral vector (10 15). The transgene expression is long-term and nontoxic.
Using two different nonhuman primate models of PD, we examined whether lentiviral-mediated delivery of GDNF could reverse the cellular and behavioral changes associated with nigrostriatal degeneration in primates.
For the first model, we chose non- lesioned aged monkeys that displayed a slow progressive loss of dopamine within the stri- atum and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) within the substantia nigra without frank cellular degeneration (16). These aged monkeys dem- onstrate changes within the nigrostriatal sys- tem that model some of the incipient cellular changes seen in early PD (17). In the second model, young adult monkeys received unilat- eral intracarotid injections of 1-methyl-4- phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce extensive nigrostriatal degeneration, resulting in a behavioral syndrome character- ized by robust motor deficits.
In the first experiment, eight aged (approx- imately 25 years old) female rhesus monkeys received injections of lentiviral vectors encod- ing b-galactosidase (lenti-bGal n 5 4) or GDNF (lenti-GDNF n 5 4) targeted for the striatum and substantia nigra (18) and were killed 3 months later.
Postmortem, all GDNF injections were localized to the caudate nucleus, putamen, and supranigral regions (19), as re- vealed by standard staining procedures (20). All aged monkeys receiving lenti-GDNF displayed robust GDNF immunoreactivity within the right striatum (Fig. 1A) and substantia nigra (Fig. 1C). In contrast, no monkeys receiving lenti-bGal displayed specific GDNF immuno- reactivity in the right striatum (Fig. 1B). Rather, these monkeys displayed robust expression of bGal similar to that reported previously (15). In lenti-GDNF treated animals, GDNF immuno- reactivity within the striatum was extremely dense and distributed throughout the neuropil (Fig. 1). When the primary antibody concentra- tion was decreased to one-tenth of the standard, the intense striatal neuropil staining was dimin- ished, and GDNF-immunoreactive perikarya were easily seen.
Numerous GDNF-immunore- active perikarya were also seen within the sub- stantia nigra of lenti-GDNF injected monkeys.
Within the striatum and substantia nigra, Nissl- stained sections revealed normal striatal cyto- architecture without significant cytotoxicity. Macrophages were occasionally observed with- in the needle tracts.
Gliosis was similar across treatment groups and was principally confined to the regions immediately surrounding the nee- dle tracts.
Lenti-GDNF injections resulted in marked anterograde transport of the trophic factor.
Intense GDNF immunoreactivity was ob- served within fibers of the globus pallidus (Fig. 1D) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (Fig. 1E) after striatal injections.
GDNF-con- taining fibers emanating from putaminal in- jection sites were seen coursing medially to- ward and into the globus pallidus (Fig. 1D). These staining patterns were clearly distinct from the injection site and respected the boundaries of the striatal target structures.
In contrast, anterograde transport of bGal was not observed in lenti-bGal monkeys.
This suggests that secreted GDNF, and not the virus per se, was anterogradely transported.

Before treatment, all monkeys displayed symmetrical FD uptake in the cau- date and putamen bilaterally (ratio: 1.02 6 0.02) (Figs. 2A and 2B, left). Similarly, there was symmetrical (4% difference) FD uptake in all lenti-bGal treated monkeys after lenti- virus injections (Fig. 2A, right). In contrast, FD uptake was significantly asymmetrical Aged monkeys underwent 2 1 0 2  , 7 1  .

With respect to absolute values, lenti-bGal animals displayed a trend toward reduced FD uptake after treatment relative to baseline levels (P 5 0.06). Qualitatively, three of four lenti- GDNF treated monkeys displayed clear in- creases in FD uptake on the treated side.
This increase in uptake (Ki value) between the groups just failed to reach statistical signifi- cance (P 5 0.06). Within the striatum, lentiviral delivery of GDNF increased a number of markers of dopa- minergic function (22). Optical density mea- surements were performed to assess the relative intensity of TH staining within the caudate nucleus and putamen (Fig. 3, A and B). On the left side where there was no lenti-GDNF ex- pression, the intensity of TH immunoreactivity within the caudate nucleus and putamen was similar between groups (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, significant increases in optical density measures of TH immunoreactivity were seen in the right striatum of lenti-GDNF infused mon- keys (Fig. 3A) relative to lenti-bGal treated animals (Fig. 3B) or the contralateral side (Fig. 3A). In this regard, there was a 44.1% and a Fig.1.

At the time of death, tissue punches were taken throughout the caudate nucleus and putamen of all monkeys.
Relative to lenti-bGal treated an- imals, measurement of dopamine (DA) and ho- movanillic acid (HVA) revealed significant in- creases in the right caudate nucleus (140% DA, P , 0.001 207% HVA, P , 0.001) and puta- men (47.2% DA, P , 0.05 128% HVA, P , 0.01) in lenti-GDNF treated aged monkeys (Fig. 4, E and F). Lentiviral delivery of GDNF to aged mon- keys resulted in an increase in the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons within the sub- stantia nigra (Fig. 3, C and D). Regardless of the extent of GDNF immunoreactivity within the midbrain, the organization of TH-immuno- reactive neurons was similar in all animals, and these neurons were not observed in ectopic locations within this locus.
Stereological counts revealed an 85% increase in the number of TH-immunoreactive nigral neurons on the side receiving lentivirally delivered GDNF (Fig. 4A) relative to lenti-bGal treated animals.
On the side (left) that did not display GDNF im- munoreactivity, lenti-GDNF treated animals contained 76,929 6 4918 TH-immunoreactive neurons.
This is similar to what was seen in lenti-bGal infused animals (68,543 6 5519). lenti-bGal infused monkeys con- Whereas tained 63,738 6 6094 TH-immunoreactive ni- gral neurons in the right side, lenti-GDNF treated monkeys contained 118,170 6 8631 TH-immunoreactive nigral neurons in this hemisphere (P , 0.001). A similar pattern was seen when the vol- ume of TH-immunoreactive substantia nigra neurons was quantified (Fig. 4B). TH-immu- noreactive neurons from lenti-bGal and lenti-GDNF treated monkeys were similar in size in the left nigra where there was no GDNF expression (11,147.5 6 351 mm3 and 11,458.7 6 379 mm3, respectively). In con- trast, a 35% increase in neuronal volume was seen on the GDNF-rich right side in lenti- GDNF injected aged monkeys (lenti-bGal 10,707.5 6 333 mm3 lenti-GDNF 16,653.7 6 1240 mm3 P , 0.001). Although stereological counts of TH mRNA containing neurons were not per- formed, there was an obvious increase in the number of TH mRNA containing neurons within the right substantia nigra in lenti- GDNF treated monkeys (Fig. 3E) compared with lenti-bGal containing animals (Fig. 3F). With regard to the relative levels of TH mRNA expression within individual nigral neurons (23), the pattern of results was similar to that observed with TH-immunoreactive neuronal number and volume (Fig. 4C). On the left side, the optical density of TH mRNA within nigral neurons was similar between lenti-bGal and lenti-GDNF treated monkeys (78.28 6 2.78 and 80.58 6 2.5, respectively). In contrast, there was a significant (21.5%) increase in the optical density for TH mRNA in lenti-GDNF treated monkeys (98.3 6 1.5) relative to lenti- bGal treated monkeys (77.2 6 2.3) on the right side (P , 0.01). In the second experiment, 20 young adult rhesus were initially trained 3 days per week until asymptotic performance was achieved on a hand-reach task in which the time to pick up food treats out of recessed wells was measured (16, 24). Each experimental day, monkeys received 10 trials per hand.
Once per week, monkeys were also evaluated on a modified parkinsonian clinical rating scale Fig.2.

One week later, monkeys were evaluated on the CRS. Only monkeys displaying severe hemiparkinsonism with the classic crooked arm posture and dragging leg on the left side continued in the study (n 5 10). It is our experience that monkeys with this behavioral phenotype display the most severe lesions neuroanatomically and do not display spon- taneous recovery behaviorally (24). On the basis of CRS scores, monkeys were matched into two groups of five monkeys, which re- ceived on that day lenti-bGal or lenti-GDNF treatment.
Using magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) guidance, we gave all monkeys lentivirus injections into the caudate nucleus (n 5 2), putamen (n 5 3), and substantia nigra (n 5 1) on the right side using the same injection parameters as in experiment 1.
One week later, monkeys began retesting on the hand-reach task three times per week for 3 weeks per month (25). For statistical analy- ses, the times for an individual week were combined into a single score.
During the weeks of hand-reach testing, monkeys were also scored once per week on the CRS. Indi- viduals blinded to the experimental treatment performed all behavioral assessments.
Three months after lentivirus treatment, monkeys received a FD PET scan and were killed 24 to R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E S 48 hours later, and tissues were histologically processed as before.
Within 1 week after the lentivirus injec- tions, one monkey from each group died.
Necropsies from these animals revealed only the presence of mild necrosis from multifocal random hepatocellular coagulation.
On ac- count of these deaths, all remaining monkeys underwent detailed necropsies after death, and no significant abnormalities in any or- gans were seen.
Before MPTP treatment, all young adult monkeys scored 0 on the CRS. After MPTP, but before lentivirus injection, monkeys in the lenti-GDNF and lenti-bGal groups aver- aged 10.4 6 0.07 and 10.6 6 0.6, respective- ly, on the CRS (P. 0.05). After lentivirus treatment, significant differences in CRS scores were seen between the two groups (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P , 0.0001 Fig.5A). CRS scores of monkeys receiving lenti- bGal did not change over the 3-month period after treatment.
In contrast, CRS scores of monkeys receiving lenti-GDNF significantly diminished during the 3-month period after treatment.
Scores began to decrease in the first month after lenti-GDNF treatment.
However, statistically significant differences between lenti-GDNF and lenti-bGal were only discerned at posttreatment observations 6, 7, 8, and 9 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P , 0.04 for each comparison). Lenti-GDNF treated animals also im- proved performance on the operant hand- reach task.
Under the conditions before MPTP administration, animals in both groups performed this task with similar speed (Fig. 5B). For the unaffected right hand, no dif- ferences in motor function were discerned for either group relative to performance before MPTP administration or to each other (P. 0.05). In contrast, performance with the left hand was significantly improved in lenti- GDNF treated animals relative to controls (P , 0.05). After MPTP, all lenti-bGal treated animals were severely impaired, with monkeys often not performing at all, or re- quiring more than the maximally allowed 30 s. In contrast, three of the four lenti-GDNF monkeys performed the task with the left hand at near-normal levels, whereas one lenti-GDNF treated monkey was impaired and performed this task in a manner similar to lenti-bGal treated animals.
Between the groups, significant differences in performance were discerned on posttreatment tests 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (P , 0.05 for each comparison). Just before being killed, all monkeys un- derwent FD PET scans.
Qualitatively, all lenti-bGal treated monkeys displayed pro- 2 1 0 2  , 7 1  .

However, there was variability in the degree of striatal TH immunoreactivity in lenti-GDNF treated animals and that variability was associated with the degree of functional recovery seen on the hand-reach task.
Two lenti-GDNF treated monkeys displayed dense TH immu- noreactivity throughout the rostrocaudal ex- tent of the striatum (Fig. 6B). In these mon- keys, the intensity of the TH immunoreactiv- ity was greater than that observed on the intact side.
These two animals displayed the best recovery.
A third lenti- functional nounced FD uptake in the left striatum and a comprehensive loss of FD uptake on the right side (Fig. 2C). In contrast, two of four lenti- GDNF treated animals displayed robust and symmetrical FD uptake on both sides (Fig. 2D). The remaining two lenti-GDNF mon- keys displayed reduced FD uptake on the right side, but with Ki values 50 to 100% than lenti-bGal controls (Fig. 2). greater Quantitatively, no differences in FD uptake were observed between groups within the left striatum (P. 0.05). In contrast, there was a significant (.300%) increase in FD uptake in lenti-GDNF treated animals in the right stri- atum relative to lenti-bGal treated animals (P , 0.05). When the right striatum was subdivided, significant increases in FD up- take were only seen within the putamen of lenti-GDNF treated animals (P , 0.05). After death, a strong GDNF-immunoreac- tive signal was seen in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and substantia nigra of all lenti- GDNF treated, but none of the lenti-bGal treated animals.
The intensity and distribu- tion of GDNF immunoreactivity was indis- tinguishable from what we observed in aged monkeys (see Fig.1). All lenti-bGal treated monkeys displayed a comprehensive loss of TH immunoreactiv- ity within the striatum on the side ipsilateral to the MPTP injection (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Fig.6.

After MPTP-treatment, lenti-GDNF in- jected monkeys displayed functional improve- ment on (A) the clinical rating scale and (B) the hand-reach task.
All tests were performed 3 weeks per month [see (15)]. On the clinical rating scale, monkeys were matched into groups based upon the post-MPTP score.

Monkeys were not tested on this task during the week between MPTP and lentivirus injection.
*P , 0.05 relative to lenti-bGal. GDNF treated monkey also displayed robust functional recovery on the hand-reach task.
However, the enhanced striatal TH immuno- reactivity in this animal was limited to the post-commissural putamen. The fourth lenti- GDNF treated monkey did not recover on the hand-reach task.
Although putaminal TH immunoreactivity in this animal was still greater than controls, the degree of innerva- tion was sparse and restricted to the medial post-commissural putamen. Lenti-GDNF treatment enhanced the ex- pression of TH-immunoreactive fibers through- out the nigrostriatal pathway.
Unlike what was observed in aged monkeys, however, some TH-immunoreactive fibers in the stria- tum displayed a morphology characteristic of both degenerating and regenerating fibers.
Large, thickened fibers could be seen cours- ing in an irregular fashion in these animals.
Rostrally, these fibers appeared disorganized at times, with a more normal organiza- tion seen more caudally.
TH-immunoreactive sprouting was also seen in the globus pallidus (Fig. 6, G and H), substantia innominata (Fig. 6, A and B), and lateral septum.
These novel staining patterns were not immunoreactive for dopamine b-hydroxylase confirming the dopaminergic phenotype of this response.
Quantitatively, lenti-bGal treated mon- keys displayed significant decreases in the optical density of TH-immunoreactive fibers within the right caudate nucleus (71.5% P , 0.006 Fig.7D) and putamen (74.3% P , 0.0007 Fig.7D) relative to the intact side.
When analyzed as a group, TH optical den- sity in the right caudate nucleus and putamen of lenti-GDNF treated monkeys was signifi- cantly greater than that seen in lenti-bGal treated monkeys (P , 0.001 for both) and was similar to that seen on the intact side of these animals (P. 0.05 for both). recovery.
All lenti-bGal treated monkeys displayed a dramatic loss of TH-immunoreactive neu- rons within the substantia nigra on the side ipsilateral to the MPTP injection (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the nigra from all four of the lenti- GDNF treated displayed complete neuropro- tection (Fig. 7A), regardless of the degree of In lenti-bGal treated functional monkeys, intracarotid injections of MPTP re- sulted in an 89% decrease in the number (Fig. 7A), and an 81.6% decrease in the density, of TH-immunoreactive nigral neurons on the side ipsilateral to the toxin injection (P , 0.001). In contrast, lenti-GDNF treated mon- keys displayed 32% more TH-immunoreac- tive nigral neurons (P , 0.001) and an 11% increase in TH-immunoreactive neuronal density (P , 0.05) relative to the intact side.
In lenti-bGal treated animals, MPTP signif- icantly reduced (32%) the volume of residual TH-immunoreactive nigral neurons on the lesion side relative to the intact side (P , 0.001 Fig.7B). In contrast, the volume of 770 27 OCTOBER 2000 VOL 290 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org 2 1 0 2  , 7 1  .

Finally, the optical density of TH mRNA was quantified bilater- ally in all animals (Fig. 7C). In lenti-bGal treated animals, there was a significant de- crease (24.0%) in the relative optical density of TH mRNA within residual neurons on the MPTP-lesioned side relative to the intact side (P , 0.03). In contrast, lenti-GDNF treated animals displayed a significant increase (41.7%) in relative optical density of TH mRNA relative to the intact side or lenti- bGal treated animals (P , 0.001). Sections from all monkeys were stained for CD45, CD3, and CD8 markers to assess the immune response after lentiviral vector injection (26). These antibodies are markers for activated microglia, T cells, and leuko- cytes including lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, eosinophils, and thymocytes. these immune markers was Staining for weak, and often absent, in these animals.
Mild staining for CD45 and CD8 was seen in two animals.
Some CD45-immunoreactive cells displayed a microglial morphology.
Other monkeys displayed virtually no immunoreac- tivity even in sections containing needle tracts.
Two additional intact young adult rhesus monkeys received lenti-GDNF injections into the right caudate and putamen and the left substantia nigra using the same injection pro- tocol (26). These animals were killed 8 months later and were evaluated by immuno- histochemistry and enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay (ELISA) (27) for long-term gene expression.
Robust GDNF immunoreac- tivity was seen in the right caudate, right putamen, and left ventral midbrain in both animals.
In the right substantia nigra, many GDNF-immunoreactive neurons were seen.
This labeling represents retrograde transport of GDNF after injections of lenti-GDNF into the right striatum. Further, dense GDNF-im- munoreactive fiber staining, representing an- terograde transport of the trophic factor, was seen within the right substantia nigra pars reticulata. Tissue punches taken at the time of death revealed significant levels of GDNF produced by striatal cells 8 months after lenti- GDNF injections.
On the side without a stri- atal injection, 0.130 6 0.062 and 0.131 6 0.060 ng/mg protein of GDNF were seen in the caudate nucleus and putamen, respective- ly. Significantly higher GDNF levels were observed within the caudate nucleus (2.25 6 0.312 ng/mg protein P , 0.001) and puta- men (3.5 6 0.582 ng/mg protein P , 0.001) on the lenti-GDNF injected side.
Our study demonstrates that delivery of GDNF cDNA into the nigrostriatal system us- ing a lentiviral vector system can potently re- verse the structural and functional effects of dopamine insufficiency in nonhuman primate R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E S models of aging and early Parkinson s disease.
Most critically, lenti-GDNF delivery prevented the motor deficits that normally occur after MPTP administration.
In this regard, functional disability was prevented on both a subjective clinical rating scale modeled after the Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale and an objec- tive operant motor test.
Consistent expression of GDNF was observed in aged and lesioned monkeys with significant and biologically rele- vant levels of GDNF observed for up to 8 months after lentivirus injection.
Indeed, the 2.5 to 3.5 ng/mg protein of GDNF produced after lenti-GDNF injections compares very favorably to the 50 to 152 pg/mg protein of striatal GDNF produced after intrastriatal adenovirus injec- tions in monkeys (28). This consistent gene expression occurred without significant toxicity to aged monkeys, and minor toxicity in two of the MPTP- treated monkeys, supporting our previous ob- servations (15). Still, the death of two mon- keys needs to be addressed.
Pathological analyses revealed only a mild necrosis from multifocal random hepatocellular coagulation in these animals, and this was not deemed to be the cause of death.
No other young adult or aged monkeys from this or a previous study (15) displayed morbidity or mortality after lentivirus injections.
Further, detailed necrop- sies from the remaining MPTP-treated ani- mals failed to reveal any relevant pathology.
Although the absolute cause of death remains elusive, we hypothesize that the death of these two monkeys relates to the impact of the sur- gical procedure 1 week after the MPTP injec- tions and is unrelated to the lentivirus injection.
In aged monkeys, lentiviral delivery of GDNF augmented host nigrostriatal function as determined by a variety of morphological, physiological, and neurochemical dependent measures.
In this regard, lenti-GDNF in- creased the size and number of TH-immuno- reactive neurons within the substantia nigra increased the expression of TH mRNA within these neurons increased the levels of dopa- mine, dopaminergic metabolites, and dopa- minergic markers in the striatum and in- creased FD uptake within the striatum as determined by PET scan.
Enhanced nigrostri- atal dopamine function was consistently as- sociated with the expression of lentivirally delivered GDNF, as enhanced nigrostriatal function was only seen on the side with ro- bust gene expression.
We used aged monkeys to model specific cellular changes that occur in aging and the earliest aspects of PD.
Phenotypic down-reg- ulation of the TH gene and protein are among the earliest pathological events seen within the substantia nigra in PD (17), and analo- gous changes are seen in aged rhesus mon- keys (16). The number of TH-immunoreac- tive nigral neurons seen in lenti-bGal inject- ed animals was similar to that previously reported for aged rhesus monkeys (16). In contrast, lenti-GDNF treated aged monkeys displayed nigral neurons in numbers similar to those seen in young adult animals.
The possibility that the lenti-GDNF spurred neu- rogenesis of dopaminergic nigral neurons cannot be ruled out.
However, the delivery of lenti-GDNF to the nigral region resulted in transgene expression throughout the midbrain. Yet, TH-immunoreactive neurons were ob- served only within established catecholaminer- gic nuclei and not in ectopic midbrain locations.
A more parsimonious explanation is that Fig.7.

The enhanced TH mRNA expression seen within nigral neurons after lenti-GDNF treat- ment supports this interpretation.
Lenti-GDNF also prevented the behavior- al and neuroanatomical effects of MPTP-in- duced nigrostriatal degeneration.
It is notable that, unlike many other neuroprotection par- adigms, the lenti-GDNF injections were per- formed after the parkinsonian state was initi- ated, thus better modeling what can be at- tempted in PD patients.
The exact mechanism by which lenti-GDNF exerted its effects re- quires further elucidation.
It is clear that neuroprotection was achieved within the substantia nigra, as these neurons do not degenerate within a week of MPTP treat- ment (29). However, striatal fibers can de- generate during this time, and whether the GDNF is preventing degeneration or induc- ing sprouting of degenerating fibers still needs to be established.
Indeed, there is evidence for both mechanisms as some an- imals displayed fiber morphology and to- pography indicative of regeneration.
A critical question is whether preservation of striatal innervation, nigral perikarya, or both, is required for functional recovery.
Although the number of animals in our study is too small to provide a definitive answer, it is notable that all lenti-GDNF treated monkeys had complete preservation of nigral perikarya. Yet, functional recovery on the hand-reach task was absent only in the one monkey with sparsest striatal reinnervation. Thus it appears that GDNF-me- diated striatal reinnervation is critical for func- tional recovery in nonhuman primates, a con- cept supported by recent studies performed in rodents (30, 31). The failure to potently protect dopaminergic innervation in the one monkey may be due to variability in the speed by which nigrostriatal fibers are lost after MPTP. At the time of the lenti-GDNF injections, dopaminer- gic fibers in this monkey may have regressed to a level where access to the GDNF was limited, and regrowth to the striatum was impossible.
Not only was lenti-GDNF capable of pre- venting the degeneration of nigrostriatal neu- rons in MPTP-treated monkeys, it augmented many of the morphological parameters rela- tive to the intact side.
It is likely that the unilateral 3-mg MPTP dose induced a small loss of TH-immunoreactive neurons on the contralateral side.
Thus the increased num- bers of TH-immunoreactive neurons may re- flect complete neuroprotection on the side of GDNF expression contrasted with a small loss of TH-immunoreactive neurons on the side not injected.
We injected lentivirus into both the striatum and substantia nigra in order to maximize the chance for an effect.
For lenti-GDNF therapy to be a practical clinical approach, studies deter- R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E S mining the regions of GDNF delivery critical to reverse progressive nigrostriatal degeneration are needed.
The importance of related biologi- cal events such as anterograde transport of GDNF from injection sites to target regions also needs to be established.
Finally, potential ad- verse events resulting from lenti-GDNF induc- ing supranormal levels of striatal dopamine needs to be evaluated.
Toward this end, vectors with built-in inducible systems that can modu- late gene expression in cases of dose-limiting side effects need to be developed.
Still, the reversal of slowly progressive cellular pheno- typic changes seen in aged monkeys, combined with the structural and functional neuroprotec- tion and regeneration seen in MPTP-treated monkeys, indicates that lentiviral delivery of GDNF may provide potent clinical benefits for patients with PD.

The cDNA coding for a nuclear-localized b-galacto- sidase (LacZ ) and the human GDNF containing a Kozak consensus sequence (a 636-bp fragment: po- sition 1 to 151 and 1 to 485 GenBank accession numbers L19062 and L19063) were cloned in the SIN-W-PGK transfer vector [R. Zufferey et al., J. Virol. 73, 2886 (1999)]. The packaging construct and ve- sicular stomatis virus G protein (VSV-G) envelope used in this study were the PCMVDR8.92, PRSV-Rev, and the PMD.6 plasmids described previously R. Zufferey, D. Nagy, R. J. Mandel, L. Naldini, D. Trono, Nature Biotechnol. 15, 871 (1997) A. F. Hottinger, M. Azzouz, N. De glon, P. Gebischer, A. D. Zurn, J. Neu- rosci. 20, 5587 (2000). The viral particles were pro- duced in 293T cells as previously described (15). The titers (3 to 5 3 108 TU/ml) of the concentrated LacZ-expressing viruses (200,000 and 250,000 ng p24/ml in experiment 1 and 450,000 ng p24/ml in experiment 2) were determined on 293T cells.
The GDNF-expressing viral stocks were normalized for viral particles content using p24 antigen measurement.
19.
All experimentation was performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and institutional animal care approval.
Level II Biosafety procedures were used.
Under MRI guidance, each monkey received six stereotaxic injec- tions of lenti-bGal or lenti-GDNF bilaterally into the caudate nucleus, putamen, and substantia nigra. Injec- tions were made into the head of the caudate nucleus (10 ml), body of the caudate nucleus (5 ml), anterior putamen (10 ml), commissural putamen (10 ml), post- commissural putamen (5 ml), and substantia nigra (5 ml). Injections were made through a 10-ml Hamilton syringe connected to a pump at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. During the injection, the needle was raised 1 to 2 mm to better disperse the lentivirus through the intended target.
The needle was left in place for an additional 3 min to allow the injectate to diffuse from the needle tip.
The left side was injected 6 weeks before the right.
During the (cid:222)rst surgical session, there was a technical failure with the virus aggregating in the needle, which prevented its injection into the brain.
This was con- (cid:222)rmed at postmortem examination using GDNF-immu- nohistochemistry and bGal histochemistry. Thus, the left side served as an additional control for the right side.
20.
GDNF immunohistochemistry was performed with a commercially available antibody (R&D Systems, Min- neapolis, MN 1:250), using the ABC method and nickel intensi(cid:222)cation. Deletion or substitution for the primary antibody served as controls.
Under control conditions, no staining was observed.
21.
All procedures followed an overnight fast.
After seda- tion with ketamine (10 to 15 mg/kg), the animal was intubated, and femoral angiocatheters were placed for tracer injection and blood sampling.
Anesthesia was then maintained by 1 to 2% iso(cid:223)uorane for the remain- der of the procedure.
Carbidopa (2 to 3 mg/kg IV ) was administered 30 min before the FD study.
The animal was placed in a stereotaxic head holder constructed of materials compatible with PET scanning, and a trans- mission scan was acquired for correction of the emis- sion data for attenuation.
FD (185 MBq) was adminis- tered over 30 s and a 90-min three-dimensional dy- namic emission scan started.
The scan included 22 frames with durations increasing from 1 min initially to 5 min at the end.
The bed was moved cyclically by the interplane distance between each pair of 5-min scans to give a net coronal sampling interval of 2.125 mm.
Regions of interest (ROI) were placed on the caudate nucleus, putamen and occipital cortex in individual mor- phometric MR images coregistered with the FD image data.
Cortical time courses were used as input functions to generate functional maps of the uptake rate constant Ki by the modi(cid:222)ed graphical method [C. S. Patlak, R. G. Blasberg, J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 5, 584 (1985)]. Striatal ROIs were transferred to the functional maps, and the Ki values were evaluated as the ROI means for each structure.
22.
All monkeys were perfused with saline.
The brain was removed, immersed in ice-cold saline for 10 min, and slabbed on a monkey brain slicer.
Slabs through the head of the caudate and putamen were punched bilaterally with a 1-mm brain punch.
These punches were processed for HPLC (24). The tissue slabs were immersed in Zamboni(cid:213)s (cid:222)xative. Stereological counts and volumes of TH-immunoreactive neurons were performed with NeuroZoom software using the op- tical dissector method for cell counting and the nu- cleator method for measuring neuronal volume (16). 23.
The TH riboprobe was prepared as previously de- scribed (9). The probe was conjugated to 2 mM biotin-14-CTP (Gibco BRL/Life Technologies, Rock- ville, MD), 1 mg Pvu I linearized pBS-TH39, 5 mM DT T, 50 U RNasin, 4 U T3RNA polymerase, 0.5 mM CTP, and 0.25 mM of ATP, GTP, and UTP. Tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry by the ABC method using this probe as the primary antibody.
Optical density measurements were performed using NIH Image.

Testing was performed during weeks 2 to 4 for month 1, and weeks 1 to 3 for months 2 and 3.
Monkeys were not tested for the (cid:222)rst week in month 1 to allow them time to recover from surgery.
Testing was not performed for the (cid:222)nal week of months 2 and 3 to allow for routine veterinary care (month 2) and transportation to the University of Wisconsin for PET scans (month 3). 26.

K. Wilhelm,1 R. N. Schouten,1 C. J. P. M. Harmans,1 T. P. Orlando,2 Seth Lloyd,3 J. E. Mooij1,2 Microwave spectroscopy experiments have been performed on two quantum levels of a macroscopic superconducting loop with three Josephson junctions.
Level repulsion of the ground state and (cid:222)rst excited state is found where two classical persistent-current states with opposite polarity are degenerate, indi- cating symmetric and antisymmetric quantum superpositions of macroscopic states.
The two classical states have persistent currents of 0.5 microampere and correspond to the center-of-mass motion of millions of Cooper pairs.
When a small magnetic field is applied to a superconducting loop, a persistent current is induced.
Such a persistent supercurrent also occurs when the loop contains Josephson tun- nel junctions.
The current is clockwise or counterclockwise, thereby either reducing or enhancing the applied flux to approach an integer number of superconducting flux quanta F 0 (1). In particular when the en- closed magnetic flux is close to half-integer values of F 0, the loop may have multiple stable persistent-current states, with at least two of opposite polarity.
The weak coupling of the Josephson junctions then allows for transitions between the states.
Previous theo- retical work (2 4) proposed that a persistent current in a loop with Josephson junctions corresponds to the center-of-mass motion of all the Cooper pairs in the system and that quantum mechanical behavior of such persis- tent-current states would be a manifestation of quantum mechanical behavior of a macro- scopic object.
In a micrometer-sized loop, millions of Cooper pairs are involved.

As a result, the coupling between the dynamics of persistent supercurrents and many-body quasi-particle states is very weak.
Josephson junction loops therefore rank among the best objects for experimental tests of the validity of quantum mechanics for systems containing a macro- scopic number of particles (3, 5, 6) [loss of quantum coherence results from coupling to an environment with many degrees of free- dom (7)] and for research on the border between classical and quantum physics.
The potential for quantum coherent dynamics has stimulated research aimed at applying Jo- sephson junction loops as basic building blocks for quantum computation (qubits) (8 11). We present microwave spectroscopy ex- periments that demonstrate quantum superpo- sitions of two macroscopic persistent-current states in a small loop with three Josephson junctions (Fig. 1A). At an applied magnetic flux of 1 2F 0, the system behaves as a particle in a double-well potential, where the classical states in each well correspond to persistent currents of opposite sign.
The two classical states are coupled via quantum tunneling through the barrier between the wells, and the loop is a macroscopic quantum two-level sys- tem (Fig. 1B) (12). The energy levels vary with the applied flux as shown (Fig. 1C). Classically, the levels cross at 1 2F 0.
Tunnel- ing between the wells leads to quantum me- chanical eigenstates that at 1 2F 0 are symmet- ric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two classical persistent-current states.
The symmetric superposition state is the quantum mechanical ground state with an energy low- er than the classical states the antisymmetric superposition state is the loop s first excited state with an energy higher than the classical states.
Thus, the superposition states manifest themselves as an anticrossing of the loop s energy levels near 1 2F 0.
We performed spec- troscopy on the loop s two quantum levels (Fig. 2) and our results show the expected anticrossing at 1 2F 0 (Fig. 3) (13). We also studied the resonance-line shapes and found behavior similar to microscopic quantum two-level systems (14, 15) (Fig. 4). Detecting quantum superposition.
In our experiments, the magnetic flux generated by the loop s persistent current was measured with an inductively coupled direct-current su- perconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) (Figs. 1 and 2), while low- amplitude microwaves were applied to in- duce transitions between the levels.
We ob- served narrow resonance lines at magnetic field values where the level separation DE was resonant with the microwave frequency.
The DC-SQUID performs a measurement on a single quantum system.
Thus, we should expect that the measurement process limits the coherence of our system.
While the sys- tem is pumped by the microwaves, the SQUID actively measures the flux produced by the persistent currents of the two states.
Detecting the quantum levels of the loop is still possible because the meter is only weak- ly coupled to the loop.
The flux signal needs to be built up by averaging over many repeat- ed measurements on the same system (Fig. 2B), such that an ensemble average is effec- tively determined.
We measure the level sep- aration, i.e., energy rather than flux, as we perform spectroscopy, and we observe a change in averaged flux when the micro- waves are resonant with the level separation (the peaks and dips in Figs.
2B and 3A). We also chose to work with an extremely under- damped DC-SQUID with unshunted junc- tions to minimize damping of the quantum system via the inductive coupling to the SQUID.
Similar observations were recently made by Friedman et al. (16) who performed spec- troscopy on excited states in a loop with a 2 1 0 2  , 7 1  .
