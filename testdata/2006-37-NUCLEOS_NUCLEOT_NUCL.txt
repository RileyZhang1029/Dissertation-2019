Szekeres � Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, General Hospital of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria � Resveratrol (RV), a naturally occurring stilbene derivative, is a potent free radical scavenger causing a number of biochemical and antineoplastic effects. It was shown to induce differentiation and apoptosis in leukemia cells and was also identified as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a key enzyme of DNA synthesis. In this study, we report about the biochemical effects of RV in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. RV effectively inhibited in situ RR activity. Furthermore, incubation of HL-60 cells with RV significantly decreased intracellular dCTP, dTTP, dATP and dGTP concentrations. In growth inhibition and clonogenic assays, RV acted synergistically with both Ara-C and tiazofurin in HL-60 cells. We conclude that RV could become a viable candidate as one compound in the combination chemotherapy of leukemia and therefore deserves further in vitro and in vivo testing. Keywords Resveratrol; Leukemia; Ara-C; Tiazofurin; Synergistic combination effects INTRODUCTION The biochemical effects of RV have been subject to intense studies, and it is understood that its antitumor activity has multifactorial causes. It has been shown that RV is an effective inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR, EC1.17.4.1),[1] which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de This study was supported by the “Medizinisch Wissenschaftlicher Fonds des Buergermeisters der Bundeshauptstadt Wien #2296” to T.

The enzyme is significantly upregulated in malignant cells, which makes RR an excellent target for cancer chemotherapy. We now revealed that RV depletes dNTP concentrations including dCTP and dGTP pools and that it is able to effectively inhibit the incorporation of 14C-labelled cytidine into DNA. Furthermore, it was tested whether a combination of RV and Ara-C or RV and tiazofurin also could yield synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. The results of these experiments could lead to additional options for chemotherapy of human leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Cell Culture All chemicals used were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria. Tiazofurin was kindly provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI Bethesda, MD). The HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA). Growth Inhibition Assays HL-60 cells were incubated with various concentrations of RV for 72 hours. To determine the IC50 value of RV, cells were then counted. To analyze the combination effects of RV with Ara-C, HL-60 cells were simultaneously incubated with various concentrations of RV and Ara-C or tiazofurin, while keeping the combination ratio constant. Determination of Deoxynucleoside-Triphosphates Logarithmically growing HL-60 cells were incubated with RV for 24 hours and dNTPs were extracted as described by Garrett and Santi.[2] dNTPs were measured using a Merck “La Chrom” HPLC system equipped with an L-7200 autosampler, an L-7100 pump, an L-7400 UV detector, and a D-7000 interface. The concentration of dNTPs was calculated as percent of control. Incorporation of 14C-Labelled Cytidine into DNA To analyze the effect of RV incubation on the in situ activity of ribonu-cleotide reductase, an assay was performed as described previously.[3] Hoechst Dye 33258 and Propidium Iodide Double Staining After incubation for 48 hours with various concentrations of RV and Ara-C or tiazofurin, cells were stained with Hoechst dye 33258 (5 µg/ml) Synergistic Effects of Resveratrol 1021 and propidium iodide (2 µg/ml), examined by fluorescence microscopy using DAPI filters and judged according to their morphology, cell mem-brane integrity and presence of apoptotic bodies. Results are presented as percentage of total cell count exhibiting apoptotic features. Statistical Calculations and Calculation of Synergism The calculations of combination effects were performed using the “Calcusyn” software designed by Chou and Talalay[4] (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO, USA). Synergistic combination effects are indicated by a combination index <1. Significant differences were calculated by t-test using the Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). RESULTS Changes in Intracellular Concentrations of dNTPs after Treatment with Resveratrol All dNTP pools were significantly decreased compared with untreated controls after incubation with 12.5 µM RV for 24 hours (69%, 61%, 26%, and 30% of control for dCTP, dTTP, dATP, and dGTP concentrations, re-spectively). Incubation with 6.25 µM RV significantly decreased intracellular dTTP and dGTP pools to 56% and 24% of control values, respectively. Inhibition of Incorporation of 14C-cytidine into DNA After treatment of HL-60 cells with 12.5, 25, and 50 µM RV for 24 hours, 14C-cytidine incorporation into DNA was significantly decreased to 45%, 31.5%, and 2.5% of control values, respectively.

Induction of Apoptosis All three compounds, RV, Ara-C and tiazofurin induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. However, RV was capable to synergistically enhance the number of apoptotic cells in combination with either Ara-C or tiazofurin (Table 2).

Horvath et al. DISCUSSION In the present study, we could show that RV inhibits in situ RR activity in human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells.[5,6] In addition, we revealed that RV decreased all four intracellular dNTP concentrations, the products of RR. By inhibition of RR it is possible to specifically target rapidly proliferating tumor cells without affecting normal cells. In combinations with Ara-C and tiazofurin, RV could synergistically enhance the cytotoxic effects of these compounds. Being an ingredient of grapes and wine, RV, therefore, might have limited toxic side effects. The use of RV might be a promising additional option for combination treatment of human leukemia. Based on our data, in vivo studies using RV in combination with compounds like Ara-C or tiazofurin, for chemotherapy of leukemia should be reasonable. REFERENCES 1.
