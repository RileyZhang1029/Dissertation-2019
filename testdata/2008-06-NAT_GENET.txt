Here, we show that loss of Phd1 lowers oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle by reprogramming glucose metabolism from oxidative to more anaerobic ATP production through activation of a Ppara pathway. This metabolic adaptation to oxygen conservation impairs oxidative muscle performance in healthy conditions, but it provides acute protection of myofibers against lethal ischemia. Hypoxia tolerance is not due to HIF-dependent angiogenesis, erythropoiesis or vasodilation, but rather to reduced generation of oxidative stress, which allows Phd1-deficient myofibers to preserve mitochondrial respiration. Hypoxia tolerance relies primarily on Hif-2a and was not observed in heterozygous Phd2-deficient or homozygous Phd3-deficient mice. Of medical importance, conditional knockdown of Phd1 also rapidly induces hypoxia tolerance. These findings delineate a new role of Phd1 in hypoxia tolerance and offer new treatment perspectives for disorders characterized by oxidative stress. Oxygen is among the elements whose reduction provides the largest free energy release per electron transfer. Most multicellular organisms consume oxygen to meet metabolic needs, relying heavily on aerobic metabolism. Nonetheless, several species, such as birds living at high altitudes, fossorial mammals and diving animals, show hypoxia tolerance that enables them to survive in conditions of limiting oxygen supply1. Other species, such as hibernating mammals, estivating reptiles and dormant Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larvae, have devel-oped mechanisms to conserve oxygen1. Central to hypoxia tolerance or oxygen conservation is a hypometa-bolic state characterized by a reduction in oxygen consumption, often more than tenfold2. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations.

Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) have also been implicated in regulating these metabolic adaptations3,4. Aerobic organisms are equipped with mechanisms to sense changes in oxygen tension. The HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1–3) are oxygen-sensitive enzymes that regulate the stability of HIFs and thereby induce cellular adaptations in response to hypoxia6,7. Knockdown of PHDs enhances HIF-dependent gene expression in vitro8,9, whereas inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation increases vessel growth10,11. A recent study reported a role of Phd2 (encoded by Egln1) in placentation, but the roles of Phd1 (encoded by Egln2) and Phd3 (encoded by Egln3) remain enigmatic12. It also remains largely unknown whether and to what extent PHDs have overlapping or unique tissue-specific activities in disease, or which molecules are downstream targets of PHDs (in particular, whether HIFs are the only targets). Oxygen consumption has been linked to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially in hypoxic conditions3,4, and oxygen conservation has been suggested to improve the survival response to severe acute hypoxia in highlanders13. We therefore characterized the role of Phd1 in oxygen consumption and hypoxia tolerance. Because of its large mass and important contribution to total body oxygen consumption, skeletal muscle has a central role in metabolism14. Here, we show that loss of Phd1 lowers oxygen consumption by reprogram-ming basal metabolism. This pathway relies, in part, on the activation of the metabolic master switch Ppara which, via upregulation of its downstream target Pdk4, restricts entry of glycolytic intermediates into the TCA cycle. Although impairing oxidative muscle performance in healthy conditions, the enhanced oxygen conservation protects Phd1-deficient myofibers against severe acute ischemia by preventing excess oxidative damage. RESULTS Generation of mice lacking Phd1 We first analyzed the expression of Phd1 in skeletal muscle. Phd1 was detectable in skeletal muscle at the mRNA (data not shown) and protein levels (Fig.1a). Immunostaining confirmed that myofibers express Phd1 (Fig.1b). To study the role of Phd1 in skeletal muscle, we generated Phd1-deficient (Egln2�/�) mice, which were healthy (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig.1 online). Loss of Phd1 did not cause any compensatory upregula-tion of Phd2 or Phd3 (Fig.1c), nor did it cause a switch in myofiber type (Fig.1d). Reduced oxygen consumption by Phd1–/– skeletal myofibers Indirect calorimetry showed that whole body oxygen consumption was reduced in Phd1-deficient mice (oxygen consumption, ml per hour per gram body weight: 4.0 ± 0.04 in wild-type versus 3.5 ± 0.04 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 7, P o 0.0005). We detected similar oxygen conservation during the day, when mice are inactive (data not shown). As skeletal muscle constitutes 40–50% of the body mass and is responsible for 40–50% of the oxygen consumption in resting conditions15, oxygen consumption by Phd1-deficient muscle was likely reduced. We therefore used high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle to measure mitochondrial respiration through complex I (by supplementing pyruvate + malate) or complex II (by including succinate). When electron transport through both complexes was activated and excess ADP was added, respiration was reduced in Phd1-deficient myofibers (Fig.1e). This defect was specific for complex I, as respiration through complex II did not show a significant reduction (Fig.1e). Similar findings were obtained when we included octanoyl carnitine (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that respiration in Phd1-deficient myofibers was reduced. * * * Protein blot Protein blot 60 40 20 20 M ito ch on dr ia l v ol um e de ns ity ( % ) 10 0 0 CI-resting CI-active CI/II-active CII-active CII-resting 80 O 2 co ns um pt io n [p m ol/ (s × m g) ] Phd1 Phd1 Phd2 Phd3 – + – +Hypoxia W T Ph d1 –/ – a b c d e f g h W T Ph d1 –/ – WT Phd1–/– WT Phd1 –/– WT WT Phd1 –/– WT Phd1–/– Phd1–/– Figure 1 Loss of Phd1 reduces oxygen consumption.

As a result of the oxygen conservation, oxidative muscle performance was impaired in Phd1-deficient mice. Indeed, when Phd1-deficient mice were forced to run uphill in a treadmill, an exercise that recruits primarily oxidative crural muscle fibers and relies on oxidative metabolism16,17, they showed worse exercise endurance than wild-type mice (running time: 53.7 ± 1.8 min for wild-type versus 44.7 ± 3.6 min for Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 16; P ¼ 0.03). Shift to anaerobic glucose utilization in Phd1–/– muscle To study the metabolic mechanisms by which loss of Phd1 conserved oxygen, we analyzed glucose and fatty acid homeostasis. In vivo 13C-NMR measurements of [13C]gluta-mate resonances in muscle extracts after infusion of [U-13C6]glucose indicated that glucose oxidation was B35% lower in Phd1-deficient mice. Indeed, [4,5-13C2]gluta-mate, expressed as a ratio versus total creatine, was significantly reduced in Phd1-deficient muscle (Fig.2a,b). Ex vivo analysis using isolated muscles confirmed that oxida-tion of [U-14C]glucose, measured by the production of 14CO2 (ref. 18), was also reduced in Phd1-deficient mice (nmol glucose/h/g wet tissue: 1,190 ± 50 in wild-type versus 990 ± 56 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 12; P ¼ 0.04). However, loss of Phd1 did not completely shut down glucose oxida-tion, as occurs in fasting or hibernation2,19. This effect was specific, as 13C-NMR measurements of [13C]glutamate resonances in muscle extracts after whole animal infusion of [U-13C]fatty acids showed that fatty acid oxidation was not altered in Phd1-deficient mice (Fig.2a,b). Glycolytic flux, measured by 3H2O production from [5-3H]glucose in isolated soleus muscle, was increased in Phd1-deficient muscle in normoxic conditions (Fig.2c). Metabolic profiling of muscle meta-bolic intermediates of the glycolytic pathway also showed an increase in 2-phosphoglycerate (Table 1). However, this increase in glycolysis was not due to an increase in blood glucose or insulin concentrations (Table 1), expression of glycolytic enzymes (Table 2) or glycogen content (data not shown) in the muscle. Loss of Phd1 reduces entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle The reduced glucose oxidation and oxygen consumption raised the question of whether entry of glycolytic intermediates into the TCA cycle was reduced in the absence of Phd1.

Concentrations of Pdk1 and Pdk4 RNAs and proteins were upregulated in Phd1-deficient muscle (Table 2 and Fig.2d). This regulation was specific, as Pdk2 expression was not affected (Table 2). The increase in Pdk4 and Pdk1 concentrations was relevant, as PDC activity was reduced by 54% in Phd1-deficient muscles (Fig.2e). However, this reduction was not as complete as that observed during fasting (93% reduction; data not shown) or hibernation2,19. Phd1–/– muscle is protected against ischemic necrosis We next determined whether this reprogramming of basal metabolism and adaptation to oxygen conservation was relevant for the response to ischemia (Fig.3). Mice were subjected to femoral artery ligation, which reduces perfusion by 70% and causes acute, severe ischemia. Histological analysis showed extensive ischemic damage in wild-type mice after 7 d of ischemia (Fig.3a). Myofiber damage was more severe and occurred earlier in the soleus and plantaris muscles, indicating that oxidative myofibers were most sensitive. Compared to the total crural muscle area in unligated limbs (8.7 ± 0.7 mm2), up to 83% was necrotic in ischemic wild-type muscles (7.2 ± 1.1 mm2; n ¼ 8), whereas, notably, ischemic Phd1-deficient muscles showed almost no necrosis (necrotic area of 0.8 ± 0.5 mm2 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 8; P o 0.001; Fig.3b). The role of Phd1 was specific, as ischemic muscle was severely necrotic in heterozygous Phd2-deficient (Egln1+/–) and homozygous Phd3-deficient (Egln3–/–) mice (Fig.3c,d). Heterozygous Phd1-deficient (Egln2+/–) muscles were also not protected (necrotic area of 5.9 ± 1.4 mm2; n ¼ 8; P ¼ n.s.). Phd1-deficient myofibers are hypoxia tolerant We explored whether the survival of ischemic Phd1-deficient muscles 7 d after femoral artery ligation was attributable to enhanced tissue regeneration. In contrast to wild-type muscle, muscle fibers in Phd1-deficient mice did not show any signs of regeneration or satellite cell activation or proliferation (Fig.3e–h). We therefore suspected that Phd1-deficient myofibers were protected against ischemic necrosis. Indeed, extensive necrosis was detected in wild-type but not Phd1-deficient muscle after 48 h of ischemia (Fig.3i,j). Immunolabeling of activated caspase-3 indi-cated that wild-type but not Phd1-deficient myofibers showed signs of apoptosis, most prominently in oxidative myofibers, within 4 h of ischemia (Fig.3m,n). By electron microscopy, mitochondrial ultrastructure was also better preserved in ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers (Fig.3o,p; cristae surface density: 13.8 ± 1.7 mm–1 in wild-type versus 26.3 ± 4.2 mm–1 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 3; P ¼ 0.05). Loss of Phd1 rendered myofibers hypoxia tolerant in other models as well, including a transient hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion model that is known to cause extensive muscle damage through oxidative stress21 (Fig.3k,l). Thus, loss of Phd1 (Egln2�/�), but not of Phd2 (Egln1+/�) or Phd3 (Egln3�/�), provided protection against ischemic muscle cell death. Obviously, the hypoxia tolerance was not absolute, as Phd1-deficient cells died when exposed to prolonged anoxia, such as that in ‘no flow’ models of organ ischemia (data not shown). Hypoxic Phd1–/– myofibers consume less oxygen We then analyzed whether various biological processes known to be regulated by HIFs, such as angiogenesis, vasodilation and erythro-poiesis22, underlay the hypoxia tolerance. However, hypoxia tolerance of Phd1-deficient myofibers was not attributable to the formation of supernumerary (collateral) vessels or to an accelerated revasculariza-tion of ischemic limbs, nor was it due to enhanced erythropoiesis, elevated myoglobin levels or an increased compensatory vasodilation after femoral artery ligation (Supplementary Note). Perfusion of ischemic hindlimbs was also comparable in both genotypes (muscle perfusion 2 h postligation, ml/g/min: 0.13 ± 0.04 in wild-type mice versus 0.15 ± 0.03 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 4; P ¼ n.s.). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry further showed that oxygen delivery was comparable in both genotypes in baseline and ischemic conditions (Fig.4a). Because loss of Phd1 lowers myofiber oxygen consumption in baseline conditions, we scored intracellular oxygen levels by staining myofibers for pimonidazole, a marker of hypoxia. As myofibers started to die beyond 6 h of ischemia, we stained myofibers after 2 h of ischemia, when myofibers are still metabolically active. Ischemic wild-type myofibers stained strongly for pimonidazole, indicating intracellular hypoxia and thus suggesting that, despite a reduced supply of oxygen, they continued to consume oxygen (Fig.4b)23. In contrast, ischemic Phd1-deficient muscles did not bind pimonidazole (Fig.4c), indicating that Phd1-deficient myofibers consumed less oxygen. Thus, despite similar extracellular oxygen levels, intracellular oxygen levels differed markedly between the two genotypes. Reduced oxidative stress in ischemic Phd1-deficient muscle Oxygen consumption in conditions of low oxygen availability is associated with mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)3,24, and oxidative stress is a major cause of hypoxic skeletal muscle injury21. Because hypoxic tolerance has been associated with reduced oxidative stress25, we analyzed whether hypoxic tolerance of Phd1-deficient myofibers was due to reduced generation of oxidative stress. First, the fraction of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) that was oxidized to GS-SG was increased in ischemic wild-type but not Table 2 Relative gene expression in Phd1-deficient (Egln2�/�) muscle Baseline WT Egln2�/� Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (Ppara) 1.00 ± 0.07 2.01 ± 0.32** Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor d (Ppard) 1.00 ± 0.09 1.21 ± 0.14 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 1 (Pdk1) 1.00 ± 0.17 1.58 ± 0.42* Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 2 (Pdk2) 1.00 ± 0.18 1.17 ± 0.17 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (Pdk4) 1.00 ± 0.08 1.85 ± 0.21** Hexokinase 4 (Gck) 1.00 ± 0.36 1.28 ± 0.19 Phosphofructokinase-M (Pfkm) 1.00 ± 0.12 0.87 ± 0.11 Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) 1.00 ± 0.12 0.95 ± 0.10 Phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1) 1.00 ± 0.12 1.02 ± 0.13 Pyruvate kinase, muscle (Pkm2) 1.00 ± 0.07 1.19 ± 0.06 Quantitative RT-PCR data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

Second, after 3 h of ischemia, wild-type but not Phd1-deficient myofibers stained strongly for 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of deoxyguanosine oxidation26, espe-cially oxidative fibers (8-OHdG+ nuclei per optical field, fold increase versus baseline: 7.5 ± 1.7 in wild-type mice versus 3.3 ± 1.0 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 5; P ¼ 0.05; Fig.4d–g). Third, after 6 h of ischemia, protein carbonylation was induced in ischemic wild-type but only minimally in ischemic Phd1-deficient muscle (densitometry, percentage of baseline: 390 ± 91% in wild-type versus 140 ± 39% in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 5; P ¼ 0.03; Fig.4h). Thus, loss of Phd1 reduced the formation of ROS in ischemic myofibers. Reduced mitochondrial damage in ischemic Phd1–/– myofibers ROS are well known to damage mitochondria and impair mitochon-drial metabolism27. Consistent with reduced oxidative stress, mitochondrial performance was less severely impaired in ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers. First, state 3 respiration of isolated muscle mitochondria (known to be sensitive to ischemic insults) was severely impaired in ischemic wild-type muscle, but not (or only minimally) in Phd1-deficient muscle (Supplementary Note). Furthermore, mito-chondrial succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase, both of which contain iron-sulfur groups and are therefore sensitive to oxidation by ROS28, remained more functional in ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers (Fig.4i,j). This effect was specific, as the activity of citrate synthase was not affected (U/mg protein, in baseline and ischemia: 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.10 ± 0.01 in wild-type mice versus 0.11 ± 0.01 and 0.12 ± 0.005 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 7; P ¼ n.s.). The functional preservation of ischemic Phd1-deficient mitochondria is consistent with their reduced structural damage (see above). Phd1–/– myofibers produce ATP despite ischemia 31P-NMR analysis of energy-rich phosphates in hindlimb muscles of live mice showed that, in acute ischemia, skeletal muscle ATP con-centrations are initially maintained through rapid breakdown of phosphocreatine (PCr) by creatine kinase, an enzyme that transfers high-energy phosphates from PCr to ADP to generate ATP. In wild-type mice, PCr concentrations progressively declined over 120 min after onset of ischemia (Fig.4k,l), whereas inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations steadily increased, indicating that the rate of ATP utilization exceeded the rate of oxidative and glycolytic ATP regenera-tion. In contrast, in Phd1-deficient mice, muscle PCr contents decreased only during the first 30 min after onset of ischemia, after which they stabilized and even tended to increase during prolonged ischemia (Fig.4l). Thus, loss of Phd1 protected myofibers against complete ischemia-induced energy depletion. Generation of energy in ischemic Phd1–/– myofibers We then analyzed how Phd1-deficient myofibers were capable of generating ATP despite the severe reduction in oxygen supply.

Notably, however, glucose oxidation was completely arrested in ischemic wild-type but not in Phd1-deficient myofibers ([4,5-13C2]glutamate peak, percentage of total creatine: 0.03 ± 0.02% in wild-type mice versus 0.18 ± 0.06% in Phd1-deficient muscle; n ¼ 6; P o 0.05). In fact, compared to the corresponding baseline values, glucose oxidation in ischemic wild-type and Phd1-deficient myofibers proceeded at o5% and 50% of its normal rate, respectively. The complete elimination of glucose oxidation in ischemic wild-type myofibers results from the severe oxidative mitochondrial damage (see above). We observed similar findings when we analyzed fatty acid oxidation (Supplemen-tary Note). Therefore, preserved mitochondria in ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers are still competent to oxidize glucose and fatty acids, albeit at 50% of the normal rate in baseline conditions. We also studied whether enhanced glycolytic flux contributed to the ability of Phd1-deficient myofibers to produce sufficient energy in low-oxygen conditions. Measurements in isolated muscles ex vivo showed that glycolytic flux was increased in Phd1-deficient fibers during 6 h of low-oxygen conditions (mmol glucose/h/g wet tissue: 29.3 ± 0.3 in wild-type versus 48.2 ± 0.5 in Phd1-deficient mice; n ¼ 10; P ¼ 0.002). Role of Ppara in hypoxia tolerance induced by loss of Phd1 It is well established that the expression of Pdk4 is upregulated by the metabolic regulator Ppara29. Notably, loss of Phd1 upregulated the expression of Ppara (encoded by Ppara) in the muscle at the mRNA (Table 2) and protein levels (percentage of wild-type expression: 470 ± 40%; n ¼ 3; P ¼ 0.001). The induction of Ppara was specific, as expression of Ppard, a key regulator of skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation14, was not affected by Phd1 deficiency (Table 2). Moreover, partial knockdown of Ppara in muscles of Phd1-deficient mice in vivo through electroporation of shPparaKD construct, reducing Ppara expression to 58 ± 6% relative to the control shPparaCTR construct (n ¼ 10; P ¼ 0.012), also lowered expression of Pdk4 (78 ± 6% of shPparaCTR, n ¼ 12; P ¼ 0.03). The shPparaCTR construct, used as a control, differed from shPparaKD by a mismatch of ten nucleotides in the sequence of Ppara. To strengthen the link between Pdk4 and Ppara and to assess the relevance of Ppara as a molecular mediator of the hypoxia tolerance, we knocked down Ppara in hindlimb muscles of Phd1-deficient mice by electroporating constructs encoding selective interference RNAs against Ppara (shPparaKD). Knockdown of Ppara completely abol-ished the hypoxia tolerance of Phd1-deficient myofibers (Fig.5a,b). Notably, pretreatment of wild-type mice with the Ppara agonist fenofibrate caused the opposite effect and induced hypoxia tolerance (necrotic muscle area: 5.7 ± 0.5 mm2 in control versus 1.9 ± 0.3 mm2 after fenofibrate; n ¼ 4; P o 0.001). Moreover, fenofibrate upregu-lated the expression of Ppara and Pdk4 (mRNA expression, as a percentage of wild-type expression: 177 ± 4% for Ppara; n ¼ 7; P ¼ 0.01; 245 ± 5% for Pdk4; n ¼ 7; P ¼ 0.01). Phd1–/– fiber protection is regulated mainly via Hif-2a Loss of Hif-2a results in mitochondrial dysfunction and skeletal myopathy30. We therefore speculated that Hif-2a might be a down-stream target of Phd1 conferring muscle resistance to ischemia.

In baseline conditions, Hif-2a concentrations were variably detectable, but, when measurable, they were higher in Phd1-deficient muscle (Fig.5c). By contrast, Hif-1a protein expression was low or unde-tectable in both genotypes in baseline and ischemic conditions (data not shown). Moreover, baseline Epas1 (encoding Hif-2a) expression was fivefold more abundant than Hif1a (encoding Hif-1a) in muscle of both genotypes (mRNA copies per 104 copies of b-actin (Actb mRNA): 41 ± 2.6 for Epas1 versus 8.2 ± 0.3 for Hif1a; n ¼ 6). To further assess whether ischemic muscle protection in Phd1-deficient mice was dependent on Hif-2a, we intercrossed Phd1-deficient mice with animals lacking one copy of Epas1 (as loss of both Epas1 alleles caused embryonic death31). Heterozygous loss of Epas1 completely abrogated the hypoxia tolerance in Phd1-deficient (Egln2�/�) mice (necrotic muscle area: 7.3 ± 1.0 mm2 in wild-type mice versus 1.7 ± 1.1 mm2 in Egln2�/� mice and 7.7 ± 1.1 mm2 in Egln2�/�;Epas1+/� mice; n ¼ 10; P o 0.001 for Egln2�/�;Epas1+/� versus Egln2�/� mice by univariate analysis with Bonferroni correc-tion for multiple testing and by Mann-Whitney test; Fig.5d). In contrast, heterozygous loss of Hif1a caused intermediate protection; however, this effect did not reach statistical significance (necrotic muscle area: 3.5 ± 1.1 mm2 in Egln2�/�;Hif1a+/� mice; n ¼ 8; P ¼ 0.24 versus Egln2�/� mice; Fig.5d). Phd1 knockdown induces hypoxia tolerance in Egln2 +/� mice Our genetic data indicate that germline inactivation of Phd1 protects skeletal muscle against ischemic necrosis. To assess the putative therapeutic relevance of this finding, we tested whether short-term inhibition of Phd1 in adult wild-type mice would provide similar protection. Because selective PHD inhibitors were not available, we used DNA constructs designed to produce short hairpin interference RNA to knock down Phd1 expression: shPhd1KD and a control shPhd1CTR, which differed by a mismatch of ten nucleotides. The efficiency and specificity of shPhd1KD and shPhd1CTR were tested in vitro (Supplementary Note). Electroporation of shPhd1KD into Egln2+/� muscle reduced Egln2 (encoding Phd1) transcripts to 23 ± 4% (n ¼ 13; P o 0.001) of the levels normally detected in wild-type muscle, whereas a similar dose of shPhd1CTR was ineffective (83 ± 5% of non-electroporated Egln2+/� muscle; n ¼ 13; P ¼ 0.2). Histological analysis 2 d after femoral artery ligation showed that shPhd1CTR insignificantly reduced necrosis of Egln2+/� muscle (necrotic area: 5.5 ± 1.2 � 10�1 mm2 in non-electroporated versus 3.7 ± 1.1� 10�1 mm2 after shPhd1CTR; n ¼ 13; P ¼ n.s.). By contrast, electroporation of shPhd1KD reduced necrosis of Egln2+/� myo-fibers by 83% and 74% compared to non-electroporated or shPhd1CTR-injected muscle, respectively (necrotic area: 0.9 ± 0.3 � 10�1 mm2 after shPhd1KD; n ¼ 13; P o 0.005 versus non-electroporated and P o 0.05 versus shPhd1CTR by t-test and Mann-Whitney test; Fig.5e). Thus, similar to germline Phd1 inactiva-tion, knockdown of Phd1 rendered myofibers hypoxia tolerant. DISCUSSION Over millions of years of evolution, organisms have developed mechanisms to exploit the metabolic energy potential of oxygen. However, oxygen is not always sufficiently available to allow oxidative metabolism. Moreover, oxygen is also a source of reactive oxygen species that, in excess, may be toxic and harmful. Mechanisms are thus necessary to control the switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and to regulate oxygen consumption. Our genetic study shows that Phd1, which acts as an oxygen sensor, controls this switch in skeletal muscle in vivo and, in doing so, determines hypoxia tolerance. The metabolic alterations underlying the hypoxia tolerance are schemati-cally depicted in Figure 6. A molecular mechanism linking oxygen sensing and consumption has not been firmly established. Although HIF-1a regulates oxygen consumption through PDK1 in vitro3,4, it was hitherto unknown whether such regulation was relevant in vivo, whether it relied on a reduction in glucose acid oxidation, and, if so, whether it was Figure 5 Role of Ppara and Hif-2a, and hypoxia tolerance by knockdown of Phd1.

Our studies show that, in the absence of Phd1, oxygen consumption is reduced in skeletal muscle in vivo, and that oxygen conservation is attributable to a selective decrease in glucose oxidation, without alterations in fat combustion. At the molecular level, loss of Phd1 upregulates Pdk1 and Pdk4; both PDKs restrict the entry of glycolytic intermediates into the TCA cycle by inhibiting the activity of PDC32. However, a consequence of this is that oxidative muscle performance is impaired in healthy Phd1-deficient mice. Loss of Phd1 induces hypoxia tolerance in myofibers to a sufficient extent that these cells are protected against acute severe hypoxia, which is lethal for wild-type cells. The rapidity of this protection implies a reprogramming of basal metabolism that ‘prepares’ Phd1-deficient mice to cope better with such acute ischemic insults. Indeed, by decreasing glucose oxidation, oxygen consumption is reduced in Phd1-deficient myofibers in baseline conditions; precisely because of this conservation of oxygen, Phd1-deficient myofibers generate less oxidative stress in ischemic conditions (see below). As a result, mitochondrial structure and performance are not irreversibly damaged, allowing ischemic Phd1-deficient mitochondria to maintain a critical residual degree of oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, almost paradoxically, the reduced respiration in baseline conditions is the very mechanism that ultimately ensures continuing respiration in ischemic conditions in Phd1-deficient myofibers. Because Phd1 has a substan-tially higher Km for oxygen than cytochrome c oxidase, our findings raise the possibility that Phd1 provides an advance warning function enabling compensatory responses before life-threatening metabolic insufficiency or hypoxia. Of note, the survival benefit in ischemia induced by inactivation of Phd1 comes at the expense of an impaired oxidative muscle performance in healthy conditions. When oxygen supply is limiting, mitochondrial respiration declines, and cells shift to anaerobic energy production. The EPR measurements indicate that oxygen supply was reduced in ischemia by B80% in both wild-type and Phd1-deficient mice. Hence, respiration was expected to be comparably reduced in both genotypes. However, when hypoxia is severe and sustained (as in our model), mitochon-drial performance is further suppressed by oxidative damage33,34. ROS are a normal by-product of the electron transfer chain in aerobic conditions, but, when mitochondria keep consuming oxygen in hypoxic conditions, ROS are generated in excess (Fig.6b)3,4. The pimonidazole results indicate that ischemic wild-type myofibers continued to consume oxygen despite the limited oxygen supply. Several lines of evidence indicate that ischemic wild-type myofibers then generated excessive amounts of ROS and that mitochondrial respiration progressively declined until it was completely eliminated. At this stage, ischemic wild-type myofibers could no longer generate ATP and died (Fig.6c). In contrast, because of the metabolic adaptation, ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers consumed less oxygen and thereby generated less oxidative stress. As a result, respiration was not entirely eliminated, and mitochondria remained capable of oxidative phosphorylation, albeit at a much reduced level compared to that in normoxic conditions (Fig.6e). Besides the better preservation of oxidative phosphorylation, enhanced glycolysis further protects ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers against metabolic demise. Concomitant with the decrease in glucose oxidation (by B30%), glycolysis was comparably increased (by B30%) in Phd1-deficient muscle in baseline conditions. We did not detect major changes in glycolytic enzyme concentrations in Phd1-deficient muscle, perhaps because Hif-2a is a more important mediator than Hif-1a in these mice. However, mitochondrial respira-tion and glycolytic flux are known to be tightly coupled to ensure ATP production under conditions of varying oxygen supply (Pasteur effect)35.

(a) Baseline energy metabolism in wild-type myofibers: ATP is generated by anaerobic glycolysis (cytosol) and by glucose oxidation in the TCA cycle (mitochondrial matrix; MX), where it provides electrons (e–) for the mitochondrial electron-transport chain (ETC; yellow) that consequently drives the synthesis of ATP by the ATP synthase (red). (b,c) Lethal response to hypoxia in ischemic wild-type myofibers. As a result of the reduced oxygen supply, oxidative phosphorylation is reduced. Nonetheless, ischemic wild-type myofibers continue to consume oxygen, thereby generating excess ROS within the ETC (b). This increase in oxidative stress inactivates TCA and ETC enzymes (red line) during prolonged ischemia (c), ultimately causing irreversible mitochondrial damage (cristolysis, indicated by dotted line) and complete shutdown of oxidative energy metabolism. Anaerobic glycolysis cannot compensate for the loss of oxidative ATP production, leading to cellular energy exhaustion and demise. (d) Baseline metabolic reprogramming in Phd1-deficient myofibers. Enhanced expression of Pdk4 reduces glucose oxidation and oxygen consumption in Phd1-deficient myofibers. Coincidently, loss of Phd1 stimulates glycolytic production of ATP. (e,f) Hypoxia tolerance in Phd1-deficient myofibers. Reduced oxygen consumption leads to attenuated ROS formation in ischemic Phd1-deficient myofibers (e). As a consequence, enzymes in the TCA and ETC are not (or are less) inactivated (f), thereby enabling residual oxidative phosphorylation (albeit lower than in baseline conditions because of the reduced oxygen supply). In addition, increased glycolysis together with the residual respiration provides sufficient ATP for survival. WT, wild type. NATURE GENETICS VOLUME 40 [ NUMBER 2 [ FEBRUARY 2008 17 7 ART I C LES © 20 08 N at u re P u b lis h in g G ro u p  h tt p ://w w w .n at u re .c o m/n at u re g en et ic s between 0.8 and 0.95. Thus, in aerobic conditions, glucose is oxida-tively metabolized, yielding energy at high efficiency (about 30 moles ATP per mole glucose). In contrast, in anaerobic conditions, glucose is glycolytically metabolized by glycolysis, with reduced energy produc-tion (2 moles ATP per mole glucose). Because ATP is an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase, a decrease in energy charge will accelerate glycolytic flux to restore ATP levels. Hence, the increase in anaerobic metabolism may be secondary to the decrease in mitochon-drial respiration in Phd1-deficient mice, though other mechanisms cannot be excluded. The upregulation of Epas1 (encoding Hif-2a) in Phd1-deficient muscle, the more abundant expression of Epas1 than Hif1a in muscle, and the reversal of hypoxia tolerance in Egln2�/�;Epas1+/� mice all indicate that Hif-2a is, at least in part, a downstream mediator of Phd1 in hypoxia tolerance. Moreover, heterozygous loss of Epas1 partially normalized the elevated expression of Pdk4 and Ppara (data not shown). A role for Hif-2a in the hypoxia tolerance pathway is also consistent with findings that loss of Hif-2a causes generalized oxidative stress30. HIF-1a also seems to be involved in the PHD1 pathway, although perhaps less prominently, likely by regulating the expression of PDK1 (refs. 3,4). Of note, others previously documented a role of HIF-1a in skeletal muscle metabolism16. An intriguing observation is that Ppara seems to act downstream of Phd1. Ppara is expressed in oxidative muscle fibers and is a transcrip-tional master regulator of metabolism18,36. The coincident upregula-tion of Ppara and Pdk4 in Phd1-deficient mice is consistent with the known mode of action of this regulator to reduce glucose oxidation through induction of Pdk4. Moreover, the phenocopying of the hypoxia tolerance in Phd1-deficient mice by the fenofibrate-induced activation of Ppara in wild-type mice, together with the loss of hypoxia tolerance of Phd1-deficient mice by knockdown of Ppara, strongly suggest that Ppara is a downstream mediator of the observed hypoxia tolerance. As no HIF-binding site is readily detectable in the Pdk4 gene regulatory sequences, Phd1 may control the expression of Pdk4 through Ppara. Our data do not exclude a possible involvement of other metabolic regulators downstream of Phd1. Because loss of Phd1 did not affect fatty acid oxidation (which is stimulated by Ppara), we speculate that the elevated concentrations of Ppara were sufficient to affect glucose oxidation, but insufficient to alter fat combustion. Another outstanding molecular question is whether and how Hif-2a regulates the expression of Ppara. Our genetic study yielded additional intriguing findings. First, loss of Phd1 (Egln2�/�), but not of Phd2 (Egln1+/�) or Phd3 (Egln3�/�), selectively induced hypoxia tolerance, indicating that, even though all PHDs are expressed in myofibers, they are likely to have specific physiological roles. Our data do not exclude the possibility that Phd2 loss of function may provide muscle protection, as we did not delete both Egln1 alleles. Second, hypoxia tolerance was not due to enhanced angiogenesis, vasodilation or erythropoiesis, even though each of them is presumably regulated by PHD activity. Third, few genetic mouse models of hypoxia tolerance exist21,37. Notably, Phd1-deficient mice show features that also occur in hypoxia-tolerant humans and animals. For instance, similarly to Phd1-deficient mice, hibernating species show upregulated PDK4 and PPARa38. Hence, the Phd1-deficient mouse may constitute a new tool to unravel the enigmatic molecular basis of hibernation and other conditions of hypoxia tolerance. Germline inactivation of Phd1 reprogrammed metabolism, and this was associated with improved outcome from an acute episode of severe tissue hypoxia. Of note, this metabolic reprogramming did not require germline manipulation, as Phd1 knockdown resulted in similar effects in adult mice. The rapidity with which PCr levels started to recover (within 30 min after femoral artery ligation) indicates that this metabolic reprogramming allowed Phd1-deficient mice to react almost instantaneously. One implication of this is that physiological regulation of Phd1 activity could provide rapid, rever-sible metabolic adaptation when animals enter hibernation and become hypoxia tolerant1. Hypoxia tolerance also promotes cancer malignancy39,40, and oxidative stress has been implicated in health, longevity and numerous diseases41,42. In other cases, induction of hypoxia tolerance might be of therapeutic value to improve organ preservation for transplantation. The insight that Phd1 controls hypoxia tolerance and the response to oxidative stress warrants further analysis of its possible involvement in these processes. Notably, our findings also suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PHD1 may provide a useful means to protect muscle, and potentially other organs, from ischemic injury. METHODS Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and protein blotting. mRNA transcript expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and normalized relative to the expression of Actb or Gapdh using gene-specific primers and probes labeled with fluorescent dye (FAM) and quencher (TAMRA; for a detailed list of primers and probes, see Supplementary Table 1 online). We prepared whole tissue lysates in either lysis buffer (Tris base 10 mM pH 6.8 room temperature, 8 M urea, 1% SDS buffer) or RIPA buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared with a commercial kit (Pierce). For protein blotting, 100 mg of protein was fraction-ated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL). We incubated membranes with specific antibodies against Phd1 (ref. 8), Phd2 and Phd3 (Bethyl Laboratories), desmin (Abcam), Pdk1 (Assay designs, Inc.), Pdk4 (custom produced by Sigma-Genosys) and Vdac1 (Santa Cruz). Bound primary antibody was visualized with a species-specific horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (DakoCytomation) and chemi-luminescence system (Pierce). Histology, immunostaining, morphometry and ischemia mouse model. Crural muscles were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 10-mm thickness. After deparaffinization and rehy-dration, sections were digested with 0.2% trypsin (Sigma), blocked and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. We used the following as primary antibodies: rabbit anti-PHD1 (ref. 8), rat anti-Cd31 (BD Pharmingen; dilution 1/500), rat anti–caspase-3 (Gentaur-Biovision; dilution 1/20) and mouse anti-8OHdG (Oxis International; dilution 1/20). Sections were sub-sequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, developed with 3,3¢-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) and counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. For detection of hypoxic cells, we treated mice with pimonidazole (Chemicon) for 1 h before dissection of muscles; we then stained muscle sections with the Hydroxyprobe-1 antibody (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Metabolic fiber properties were assessed on con-secutive cryostat sections (12 mm) of snap frozen crural muscles, which were subjected to histochemical mATPase staining (pH 4.1) according to standard protocols. Limb ischemia was done as described elsewhere43. EPR oximetry in vivo. We measured muscle pO2 using charcoal powder (100 mg; CX0670-1; EM Science) as the oxygen-sensitive probe. Calibration curves were made by measuring the EPR line width as a function of the pO2 (ref. 44). We implanted charcoal bilaterally into the gastrocnemius muscles of Phd1-deficient and wild-type mice 1 week before unilateral right ligation of the femoral vessels, and recorded EPR spectra of both legs at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h after vascular ligation using an EPR spectrometer (Magnetech) with a low-frequency microwave bridge operating at 1.1 GHz and extended loop resonator.

The presence of carbonyl groups in proteins was determined in gastrocnemius supernatant fractions using a commercial kit (Oxyblot, Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-tions.

We determined mitochondrial respiration in small bundles of saponin-permeabilized myofibers from wild-type and Phd1-deficient soleus muscle using high-resolution respirometry (Oroboros Oxygraph-2k), using the DatLab Software for data acquisition and analyses (Oroboros Instruments), as previously described46–48. NMR spectroscopy. We carried out in vivo 31P-NMR spectroscopy experiments on lower limbs at 188 MHz in a Bruker Biospec, equipped with a horizontal 4.7 T superconducting magnet, using a 10-mm diameter solenoid transmit-receive coil. In vivo determination of glucose and fatty acid oxidation rates in the hindlimbs was performed using [U-13C]glucose and [U-13C]fatty acids, respectively. Running test. We tested forced exercise endurance in a treadmill graded exercise test with an initial velocity of 6 m/min and an increase in velocity of 2 m/min every 5 min. Mice were running at a 101 incline (uphill) to induce concentric exercise in the crural musculature, which recruits primarily oxidative muscle fibers. Glycolysis in isolated soleus. We dissected soleus muscles and incubated them for 4 h at 37 1C in KHB buffer (116 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.91 mM KH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.4) containing 5 mM glucose/80 mCi/mmol [5-3H]glucose. The reaction was terminated by addition of perchloric acid, and the muscles were then removed. We captured 3H2O in a plastic hanging well containing a H2O-soaked filter paper for 3 d at 37 1C and determined radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The rate of glycolysis was calculated from the difference between the rate of 3H2O formation and the rate of substrate recycling. Rate of 3H2O capturing was determined using known amounts of 3H2O as a standard. Knockdown of Ppara and Phd1 in mice. shPparaKD, shPhd1KD, shPparaCTR or shPhd1CTR pENTRTM/U6 plasmids (40 mg in 30 ml saline) were delivered to the skeletal muscle of Phd1-deficient mice through in vivo electroporation49. Injected muscles were immediately electroporated with a strain of eight pulses (80 V; duration 0.20 ms; 8 pulses, intervals 1 per sec) using an electroporation system (BTX ECM 830 electroporator; Genetronix) with Tweezertrode circular electrodes (7-mm diameter). Electroporation was carried out 5 d before induction of limb ischemia and was followed by the analysis of muscle necrosis. Statistical methods. The data were represented as mean ± s.e.m. of the indicated number of measurements. Standard t-tests were used to calculate significance levels between groups. ANOVA univariate analysis was used to correct P values for multiple comparisons against a single wild-type group (Dunnett’s correction for multiple testing) or against various groups (Bonfer-roni correction for multiple testing). In the hindlimb ischemia model, muscle necrosis was absent in some of the germline Phd1-deficient or Phd1-knock-down mice (indicative of complete protection against muscle damage), thereby disturbing normal Gaussian distribution as calculated by Shapiro-Wilk tests. In these cases, we used nonparametrical Mann-Whitney tests to calculate statis-tical significance between these groups. The P values obtained by ANOVA remained significant when correcting for the total muscle area analyzed. We used SPSS (version 11.0 for Mac OS X) for all these calculations.
