The role of wood anatomy in phylogeny reconstruction of Ericales The role of wood anatomy in phylogeny reconstruction of Ericales Frederic Lensa,b,*, Jurg Schonenbergerc, Pieter Baasb, Steven Jansena,d and Erik Smetsa,b aLaboratory of Plant Systematics, Institute of Botany and Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, K.U.Leuven, BE-3001 Leuven; bNationaal Herbarium Nederland-Leiden University Branch, PO Box 9514, NL-2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands; cDepartment of Botany, Stockholm University, Lilla Frescativagen 5, SE-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; dJodrell Laboratory, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, Surrey TW9 3DS, UK Accepted 14 September 2006 Abstract The systematic significance of wood anatomical characters within Ericales is evaluated using separate and combined parsimony analyses including 23 wood characters and 3945 informative molecular characters.
Analyses of wood features alone result in poorly resolved and conflicting topologies.
However, when pedomorphic character states are coded as inapplicable, the combined bootstrap topology results in an increase of resolution and support at most deeper nodes compared with the molecular analyses.
This suggests that phylogenetic information from the limited number of morphological characters is not completely swamped by an overwhelming amount of molecular data.
Based on the morphology of vessels and fibers, and the distribution of axial parenchyma, two major wood types can be distinguished within Ericales: (i) a primitive type, nearly identical to the wood structure in the more basal outgroup Cornales, which is likely to have persisted in one major clade, and (ii) a derived type that must have evolved in at least two separate evolutionary lines.
The occurrence of the first type is strongly correlated with shrubs to small trees growing in cold temperate or tropical montane regions, while the second type is common in tall trees of tropical lowlands.
This favors the inclusion of ecologically adaptive features in phylogeny reconstruction.

History of Ericales: from morphology to molecules Ericales, as recognized today, is a flowering plant order that includes about 11 500 species classified in 357 genera and, depending on the author, about 25 families (Stevens, 2001 onwards; Anderberg et al., 2002; Bremer et al., 2002; APG II, 2003; Barkman et al., 2004; Kubitzki, 2004; Table 1).
Geographic distribution patterns of the families are diverse: some are almost cosmopolitan (e.g., Ericaceae and Myrsinaceae) or pantropical (e.g., Ebenaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae), while others are restricted to the neotropics (e.g., Marcgraviaceae and Theophrastaceae) or concentrated in more temperate regions (e.g., Clethraceae, Cyrillaceae and Primulaceae) (Kubitzki, 2004).
Representatives are predominantly (sub)shrubs, trees and sometimes lianas.
Herbs comprise about 15% of the total number of species and are mainly restricted to Balsaminaceae, Diapensiaceae, Ericaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Myrsinaceae, Primulaceae, Samolaceae and Sarraceniaceae (Stevens, 2001 onwards; Barkman et al., 2004; Kubitzki, 2004; Table 1).
In the premolecular era, the Ericales were a morphologically homogeneous group including only three (Thorne, 1992) to eight families (Dahlgren, 1989).
The current position in the asterids and the extended delimitation of the order is strongly supported by molecular data, and finds its origin in the rbcL analysis of Olmstead et al.(1992) who found a so-called ericalean clade consisting of Rhododendron (Ericaceae), Fouquieria (Fouquieriaceae) and Polemonium (Polemoniaceae).
The newly defined Ericales clade rapidly expanded since then.
In 1993, a larger sampling of rbcL sequence data resulted in an Ericales delimitation that included various orders of Cronquists subclass Dilleniidae, plus a few additional families such as *Corresponding author: E-mail address: frederic.lens@bio.kuleuven.be The Willi Hennig Society 2007 Cladistics 10.1111/j.1096-0031.2006.00142.x Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 T a b le 1 O v er v ie w o f th e cu rr en t fa m il ie s re co g n iz ed in E ri ca le s w it h th ei r sy st em a ti c p o si ti o n a cc o rd in g to C ro n q u is t (1 9 8 8 ), D a h lg re n (1 9 8 9 ), T a k h ta ja n (1 9 9 7 ), T h o rn e (2 0 0 0 ) a n d S ch o n en b er g er et a l.

Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 Balsaminaceae (Geraniales, Rosidae), Roridulaceae (Rosales, Rosidae) and Polemoniaceae (Solanales, Asteridae) (Table 1; Chase et al., 1993; Olmstead et al., 1993).
The idea of an enlarged Ericales complex was further corroborated by analyses of: (i) more rbcL data (Morton et al., 1996, 1997); (ii) nuclear DNA sequences (Soltis et al., 1997); (iii) combined molecular and morphological data (Nandi et al., 1998); (iv) plastid and nuclear DNA (Soltis et al., 2000; Albach et al., 2001); (v) additional chloroplast sequences (Savolainen et al., 2000; Bremer et al., 2002; Hilu et al., 2003); and (vi) a combination of plastid and mitochondrial DNA (Anderberg et al., 2002).
It did not take much time before the new Ericales were recognized in a formal classification by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group at the base of the asterids (APG, 1998; APG II, 2003).
In that classification, Cornales are the first diverging asterid clade followed by Ericales, which are sister to euasterids, although in Hilu et al.(2003) the CornalesEricales position is reversed.
Since APG II, analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences have assigned the non-woody holoparasite Mitrastema (Mitrastemonaceae) to the Ericales (Barkman et al., 2004), and two additional studies using plastid, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have been published (Geuten et al., 2004; Schonenberger et al., 2005).
Despite the strong molecular support for Ericales as a whole, many interfamily relationships remain obscure.
However, recent phylogenetic analyses of molecular data revealed some clades that are well corroborated: balsaminoids (corresponding to Balsaminaceae, Marcgraviaceae, Tetrameristaceae) are sister to the rest of the order, followed by FouquieriaceaePolemoniaceae that in turn are sister to a large polytomy, including all other ericalean families (Anderberg et al., 2002; Geuten et al., 2004).
In some analyses, FouquieriaceaePolemoniaceae are part of the polytomy (Bremer et al., 2002; Schonenberger et al., 2005).
In this polytomy, ericoids (including Actinidiaceae, Clethraceae, Cyrillaceae, Ericaceae, Roridulaceae and Sarraceniaceae) and primuloids (including Maesaceae, Myrsinaceae, Primulaceae, Samolaceae and Theophrastaceae) represent well-supported evolutionary lines as well.
The Bayesian analysis of Schonenberger et al.(2005) found an additional clade uniting ericoids, Diapensiaceae, Styracaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae, but the taxonomic position of other families, especially Lecythidaceae and FouquieriaceaePolemoniaceae, requires further study.
From a morphological point of view, the present delimitation of Ericales is hard to understand because of its huge heterogeneity.
As a result, synapomorphies for the order as a whole are difficult to find.
Possible examples are the simple leaves bearing single-veined teeth with an opaque deciduous cap, gland or multicellular hair (theoid leaf teeth), and gynoecia with protruding diffuse placentae (Judd and Olmstead, 2004).
Other distinctive characters of Ericales in comparison with other asterids are the presence of ellagic acid, and the occurrence of flowers usually with twice or more as many stamens as the number of petals (versus stamens equaling or fewer than the number of petals in most other asterids), although reduction (e.g., Marcgraviaceae, Polemoniaceae) and increase (e.g., Lecythidaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae) in stamen number has occurred within several ericalean families (Judd et al., 2002; Smets and Pyck, 2003; Schonenberger et al., 2005).
The huge morphological variation within Ericales could be related to an early diversification of the order.
It is remarkable that the oldest ericalean fossils, minute flower buds of Paleoenkianthus (Ericaceae, 90 Myr), are among the oldest ones known from the core eudicots (Nixon and Crepet, 1993; Dilcher, 2000; Crepet et al., 2004; Schneider et al., 2004).
Age estimates for Ericales based on molecular data suggest even older values, ranging from about 130 to 110 Myr (Wikstrom et al., 2001, 2003; Bremer et al., 2004).
It is further estimated that the Ericales diversified about 109103 Myr, with almost all families present by the early Eocene (50 Myr) (Sytsma et al., 2006).
Wood anatomy in cladistic analyses Although it has repeatedly been demonstrated that wood features represent an important source of phylogenetic information that needs to be considered in systematic studies (Herendeen, 1996; Baas et al., 2000; Herendeen and Miller, 2000; Carlquist, 2001a; Olson, 2005), relatively few authors have included wood features in broader morphological cladistic studies of angiosperms (e.g., Loconte and Stevenson, 1991; Anderberg, 1992; Hufford, 1992; Keller et al., 1996; Nandi et al., 1998; Karehed et al., 1999; Karehed, 2001; Luna and Ochoterena, 2004).
Furthermore, the number of anatomists who have incorporated their observations in phylogenetic analyses is limited (e.g., Baas et al., 1988; Zhang, 1992; Gasson, 1994, 1996; Noshiro and Baas, 1998; Klaassen, 1999; Olson, 2002; Malecot et al., 2004).
The limited use of wood anatomical characters in phylogenetic analyses of angiosperms likely is caused by an insufficient knowledge of microscopic wood structure among many plant systematists.
In addition, phylogenetic analyses of morphological features have to cope with some generally known problems, such as subjectivity in character choice and character coding, the often unfavorable ratio between the number of features and taxa studied, the presence of polymorphisms within taxa, and the occurrence of continuously varying characters (Nixon and Davis, 1991; Stevens, 1991; Wilkinson, 1992, 1995; Thiele, 1993; Pleijel, 1995; Kornet and Turner, 1999; Strong and Lipscomb, 1999; Herendeen and Miller, 2000; Hillis and Wiens, 2000; Wiens, 2001).
Some 231F.
Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 authors even take the view that the role of morphology in phylogenetic analyses should be a minor one by stating that rigorous and critical anatomical studies of fewer morphological characters in the context of a molecular phylogeny is the way that integrated studies will and should develop (Scotland et al., 2003).
Reaction to this view soon followed, and elaborate counter-examples have been cited in subsequent papers (e.g., Jenner, 2004; Wiens, 2004).
Indeed, most of the problems related to morphological analyses are also true for molecular data.
In addition, many authors have demonstrated the systematic usefulness of morphological data in phylogenetic analyses, especially when combining morphological characters with molecular ones (e.g., Nixon and Carpenter, 1996; Pennington, 1996; Kress et al., 2001; Evans et al., 2003; Lee, 2004).
Wood structure is influenced by macroclimatic conditions, differences in life forms, and the effect of pedomorphism, and this needs to be considered in comparative wood anatomical studies.
Ecological trends in wood have been investigated in numerous studies, and can be generalized as follows: (i) vessel element length and vessel diameter decrease from wet to dry regions and from tropical to cool temperate or arctic latitudes, while the reverse is true for vessel density; (ii) a high degree of vessel grouping and the occurrence of vasicentric tracheids are most common in arid floras; and (iii) prominent helical thickenings are most abundant in Mediterranean and temperate floras (van der Graaff and Baas, 1974; van den Oever et al., 1981; Carlquist, 1985, 2001a; Baas, 1986b; Dickison, 2000; Noshiro and Baas, 2000; Baas et al., 2003).
The functional significance of some of these trends is not yet completely understood, such as helical sculpturing and vessel element length, but other trends can be explained by the interaction between two assumingly opposite aspects of water transport in plants: efficiency and safety.
For example, species growing in arctic to cold temperate climates frequently undergo freezethaw cycles, which may result in the formation of air bubbles in the water column (embolisms), and this seriously reduces water transport.
As vessels with a narrow diameter are less vulnerable to freezing-induced embolism, plants from cold climates will opt for wood that is characterized by narrow vessels with scalariform perforations as this provides a safe (but less efficient) water transport system.
On the other hand, wider vessels with simple perforations are more abundant in warm and dry areas, in which moments of peak transport are needed (cf.
Hagen Poiseuilles law).
Accordingly, tropical lowland species with typically high transpiration rates have a more efficient (but less safe) water transport mechanism than species from colder climates (Baas, 1976; Zimmermann, 1983; Sperry et al., 1994; Ellerby and Ennos, 1998; Davis et al., 1999; Schulte, 1999; Feild and Brodribb, 2001).
Some of the ecologically adaptive characters mentioned above may also have a correlation with habit.
Small shrubs are characterized by many narrow vessels showing a high percentage of scalariform perforations, while a low frequency of relatively wide vessels with simple perforations are typical of tall trees (Baas, 1976; Carlquist and Hoekman, 1985; Baas and Schweingruber, 1987; Dickison, 2000; Carlquist, 2001a; Lens et al., 2004c).
Also lianas are characterized by among others large mean vessel diameters and an increased abundance of axial parenchyma.
The wider vessels result in a higher water conduction capacity that is required to provide sufficient water transport through the relatively narrow liana stems, and the abundant axial parenchyma provides more flexibility to the stem in order to protect the water column (Carlquist, 1989a).
There are also other wood characters that can be linked to habit, such as multiseriate ray width and height, but these correlations are often poorer (Lens et al., 2004c, in press).
In some ericalean families, such as Balsaminaceae (Janssens et al., 2006) and Myrsinaceae (Kallersjo et al., 2000; Lens et al., 2005a), at least some woody taxa are known to have evolved from herbaceous ancestors, which in turn originated from primarily woody ancestors.
So, these woody taxa have secondarily derived wood, which can be characterized by one or more indicators of pedomorphism or neoteny.
Pedomorphism in wood is defined as the phenomenon in which juvenile characteristicsthose of the primary xylemhave been protracted into the secondary xylem [ wood] (Carlquist, 1962, p. 31).
Examples of these indicators are the constant decrease of vessel element length from the pith towards the cambium, the occurrence of wide scalariform intervessel pitting, and the absence of rays or the presence of exclusively upright cells in multiseriate rays (Carlquist, 1962).
Previous studies in Ericales have revealed that wood characters generally agree with molecular phylogenies at the (sub)family level, such as Ericaceae (Lens et al., 2003, 2004a,b), Lecythidaceae (Lens et al., in press), Marcgraviaceae (Lens et al., 2005b) and Theophrastaceae (Lens et al., 2005a).
Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic value of wood anatomical characters at the ordinal level, using the results of our earlier studies together with data from literature and additional personal observations.
In total, 23 wood characters are used and combined with the molecular matrix of Schonenberger et al.(2005) (hereinafter SEA), including in total 3945 parsimony informative molecular characters from chloroplast, mitochondrial as well as nuclear origin.
The objectives of this study are: (i) to provide an overview of the wood anatomical diversity within Ericales sensu APG II (2003); (ii) to demonstrate the systematic value of wood features, with particular 232 F. Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 emphasis on ecologically adaptive features, variation in life forms, neoteny and continuously varying characters; (iii) to trace evolutionary patterns of selected wood anatomical characters; and (iv) to assess the impact of a wood anatomical data set combined with a molecular data set that has orders of magnitude more characters.
Materials and methods Material and microtechniques In order to provide an overview of the wood anatomical diversity within Ericales, personal observations were carried out on 529 samples using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Lens, 2005; Appendix 2).
Ninety-five percent of the samples studied were derived from balsaminoids (Lens et al., 2005b), Ebenaceae, Ericaceae (Lens et al., 2003, 2004a,b,c), Lecythidaceae, primuloids (Lens et al., 2005a), and Sapotaceae.
Information from the other families was primarily based on comprehensive wood anatomical papers, and only few wood samples from each family were investigated to verify the literature data (Lechner, 1914; Cox, 1948a,b; Metcalfe and Chalk, 1950; Thomas, 1960; Carlquist, 1976, 1984, 1988, 1989b, 2001a,b; Giebel and Dickison, 1976; DeBuhr, 1977; Kukachka, 197882; van den Oever et al., 1981; Carlquist et al., 1984; Dickison and Phend, 1985; Gregory, 1988; Suzuki and Noshiro, 1988; de Zeeuw, 1990; Liang and Baas, 1990, 1991; Budi, 1993; Morton, 1994; Noshiro and Baas, 1998).
Information on aluminum accumulation in wood was gathered from Jansen et al.(2004b) and new observations.
The anatomical data for the outgroup genera Aucuba, Cornus, Ilex and Hydrangea were taken from Baas (1973), Stern (1978) and Noshiro and Baas (1998), and complemented with observations from InsideWood (2004 onwards).
Wood sections, about 25 lm thick, were cut using a sledge microtome (Reichert, Vienna, Austria).
After sectioning, the tissues were bleached with sodium hypochlorite and stained with a mixture of safranin and alcian blue (35 : 65).
The safranin was prepared as a 1% solution in 50% ethanol.
The 1% alcian blue stain was dissolved in pure water.
Afterwards, the sections were dehydrated with 507596% ethanol and mounted in euparal.
Macerations were made according to Franklin (1945).
Observations were carried out using a Dialux 20 light microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany).
Pictures were taken using DP50-CU digital camera (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany).
Wood sections for SEM observations were gold-coated with a sputter coater (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA) and observed using a JEOL JSM-5800 LV and a JEOL JSM-6360 scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).
Wood characters The wood anatomical terminology follows the IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identification (IAWA Committee, 1989).
Because of the incongruence between the definitions of Baas (1986a) and Carlquist (2001a) for types of imperforate tracheary elements, we prefer to give a detailed description of these cells (Appendix 1).
For all quantitative data on tracheary elements, 25 measurements from macerations were made.
When distinctly bordered vessel-ray pits are mentioned, we mean that the pit pairs are half-bordered, because the pit on the vessel side is bordered, but predominantly simple on the parenchyma cell side.
The selection of characters is based on their variation within the order and their stability at generic level (Appendix 1), and is partly similar to the ones proposed by Herendeen and Miller (2000).
Highly variable characters in Ericales with no clear distinction between character states at the genus level were expelled from the analysis (e.g., distinctness of growth rings, porosity, occurrence of pit membrane remnants, presence of two distinct ray sizes, and incidence of sheath cells).
The presence of breakdown ray areas, i.e., cavities in rays caused by disintegration of neighboring ray cells (Lens et al., 2005a), was also excluded because it is autapomorphic for the genusMyrsine (other Myrsinaceae genera that also develop this feature are not included in the matrix).
In addition, only one of two dependent characters was taken into account: vessel diameter density, vessel element fiber length, and uniseriate multiseriate ray height.
Likewise, the number of bars per perforation plate was not included because families with exclusively scalariform perforations often show many bars (30 or more), while taxa with mixed simple and scalariform plates have considerably fewer bars (110) (cf.
Herendeen and Miller, 2000).
Features that often are correlated with ecological factors, such as vessel perforation plate (char.
2), vessel element length (char.
3), vessel diameter (char.
4), vessel density (not included), helical thickenings (char.
8) and vasicentric tracheids (char.
9) were incorporated in the matrix (Appendix 1).
The inclusion of ecologically adaptive features should not necessarily be rejected a priori.
Luckow and Bruneau (1997, p. 147) stated although ecological characters may be dependent to varying degrees on ecological or [evolutionary] adaptive processes, this does not in itself affect their reliability as indicators of phylogenetic relationship.
This is further supported among others by Jansen et al.(2001, 2004a) and Baas et al.(2003), who discussed examples of ecologically adaptive wood features with a strong phylogenetic signal.
In order to evaluate the impact of different climatic conditions, seven ecotype categories were defined based on the SEA matrix: (i) temperate to tropical (sub)montane; (ii) tropical (sub)montane; 233F.
Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 (iii) temperate to boreal arctic alpine; (iv) temperate; (v) tropical lowland; (vi) tropical lowland and tropical (sub)montane; and (vii) warm arid (Figs 1 and 4).
Lowland regions are lower than 500 m, while montane areas have an elevation above 1000 m (including the Guyana Highlands).
Characters that are known to be often correlated with life forms are vessel perforation plate (char.
2), vessel element length (char.
3) and vessel diameter (char.
4) (Appendix 1).
Three habit groups were recognized to investigate the influence of this phenomenon: (i) shrubs to small trees (< 15 m); (ii) tall trees; (> 15 m); and (iii) lianas (Figs 1 and 4).
Some characters used in the analysis, such as extremely short vessel elements (char.
3 states 01), the occurrence of wide scalariform intervessel pits (char.
5 state 0), and the absence of rays or the presence of exclusively upright cells in multiseriate rays (char.

In the present study, pedomorphic wood is known for species in the genus Empetrum (Carlquist, 1989b), Impatiens (Lens et al., A B Fig.1.

In order to explore the influence of pedomorphism in our matrix, we have chosen to analyze a second wood matrix with non-applicable character states for every pedomorphic character state in these genera (cf.
Wiens et al., 2005).
As the impact of pedomorphism in wood can differ among taxa, the number of non-applicable character states for pedomorphic taxa varies: Cobaea (chars 3, 15 17), Empetrum (chars 3, 56, 1517),Heliamphora (chars 56, 17), Impatiens (chars 3, 56, 12, 1517), Lysimachia (chars 3, 12, 1517) and Sarracenia (char.
17) (Appendix 1).
Out of the 23 wood characters used in the matrix, five are continuously varying (chars 3, 4, 6, 15 and 16; see Appendix 1) and coded following the gap weighting method of Thiele (1993) with a maximum of 10 different character states.
This method considers the order and distribution of the mean values for a certain character (determined as the mean value for all available species means within one genus) and converts them to ordered, multistate characters.
The distance between the means is represented by the distance between the ordered character states in the matrix.
As ordered characters with 10 states would overestimate the importance of the continuous characters in the analysis, we have compensated this by assigning a weight of 0.1 to these characters.
This weighting would imply that the continuous characters are equivalent to the binary characters if homoplasy is absent, but they would not be equivalent to the multistate characters.
Therefore, the weight of the continuous characters is increased in separate analyses (Table 2).
The statistical tests were performed using MorphoCode, an open-source software program that implements the gap weighting method (Schols et al., 2004).
In addition, we have chosen to order five discrete characters (chars 1, 2, 5, 14 and 17), because numerous large-scale wood studies in angiosperms have demonstrated intermediate states in these characters (Bailey Table 2 Circumscription of each analysis performed in this study, with reference to the number of characters and taxa, number of most parsimonious trees (MPTs), tree lengths, CI and RI values, and figure numbers Name No.

Cladistic analyses The taxon sampling in this study is based on the molecular matrix of SEA, although some adjustments are made.
In our analyses, the second SEA terminal of the genera Fouquieria, Shortia and Symplocos was deleted.
Laplacea is removed from our analyses, as this genus is submerged within Gordonia (Kubitzki, 2004).
The genus Monotheca is a synonym of Sideroxylon (Kubitzki, 2004).
As a result, 59 of the 63 taxa that were included in the SEA study are retained.
This implies that the number of informative characters in the original SEA study slightly differs from our study (3914 versus 3945, respectively).
Of the 59 taxa included, seven are herbaceous, so wood characters were coded as inapplicable for Chimaphila (Ericaceae), Diapensia (Diapensiaceae), Galax (Diapensiaceae), Polemonium (Polemoniaceae), Primula (Primulaceae), Samolus (Samolaceae) and Shortia (Diapensiaceae).
The genera Aucuba (Garryaceae, Garryales, euasterid I), Cornus (Cornaceae, Cornales, basal asterids), Hydrangea (Hydrangeaceae, Cornales, basal asterids) and Ilex (Aquifoliaceae, Aquifoliales, euasterid II) form the outgroup.
In the combined analysis, 23 informative wood characters (Appendix 1) were analyzed in combination with the molecular matrix of the SEA study including 19 768 characters of which 3945 characters are potentially parsimony informative.
The sequence data are derived from the chloroplast (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL, rps16, trnT-F and trnv-atpE), mitochondrial (atp1 and matR) and nuclear DNA (18S and 26S).
In order to assess the impact of a small number of morphological characters (n 23) on a molecular data set comprising orders of magnitude more parsimony informative characters (n 3945), we carried out an analysis with nonapplicable character states for all 23 wood characters (ANAL 7).
Differences in bootstrap values between the latter analysis and the combined analysis will be discussed.
In order to evaluate our search strategy, we first analyzed the original SEA matrix using PAUP*4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) to compare our trees with the SEA topologies.
As both analyses resulted in identical trees, the following search strategy was chosen: stepwise addition of 100 random taxa sequences, followed by Tree Bisection-Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping (100 trees held at each step during the stepwise addition, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on).
Bootstrap analyses were conducted with the same software program, employing a full heuristic search with 500 replicates, a simple addition sequence, and TBR swapping (10 trees held at each step, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on).
The consensus of the bootstrap replicates was used to determine bootstrap values.
The search strategy of the wood matrix was adjusted because of excessive computational time to run the analysis to completion.
Therefore, MULTREES option was turned off, and a heuristic search using 1000 instead of 100 replicates was carried out.
Furthermore, a topological constraint tree had to be postulated in which the ingroup was forced to be monophyletic.
The final cladogram figures were made using MacClade 4.04 (Maddison and Maddison, 2005) and edited with Adobe InDesign CS.
As some of the branches in the bootstrap consensus tree are not highly supported, we chose to code uncertainties in character evolution as equivocal.
In addition, the option soft polytomies was used.
A total number of 14 analyses are performed in this study (ANAL 114; Table 2).
Each analysis represents an adjustment compared with the original analysis in order to assess the impact of the continuous, ecological and pedomorphic characters.
Results Wood analyses (ANAL, 15; Fig.1) A parsimony analysis of the original wood matrix resulted in 11 equally parsimonious trees with a length of 118.6 steps (ANAL 1) [all characters are parsimony informative; consistency index (CI) 0.27; retention index (RI) 0.72].
The strict consensus tree (Fig.1A) strongly deviates from the molecular phylogenies and most families prove to be para-or polyphyletic, except for Marcgraviaceae, Sapotaceae, Styracaceae and Tetrameristaceae.
An early diverging clade includes Styracaceae plus Sladenia followed by a large polytomy.
Within this large polytomy, several clades can be recognized, such as ImpatiensEmpetrumHeliamphoraFicalhoa CamelliaGordonia, RoridulaSarracenia, Acanthogilia Cobaea, FouquieriaceaeLecythidaceaeEbenaceae, CantuaSapotaceae, and primuloids(PR)balsaminoids(BA) (without the pedomorphic genera Impatiens and Lysimachia).
A bootstrap analysis gives a poorly resolved polytomy (not shown) in which only Marcgraviaceae (83), Sapotaceae without Sarcosperma (81), TetrameristaPentamerista (79), BarringtoniaCouroupita (80) and RoridulaSarracenia (54) form a clade.
If the weight of continuous characters is increased to 0.5, resolution of the strict consensus tree increases (topology not shown; ANAL 2): StyracaceaeFicalhoaSladenia, SchimaGordonia, and RoridulaHeliamphora EmpetrumSarracenia form early diverging clades, followed by LecythidaceaeSapotaceaeEbenaceae, which is sister to primuloidsbalsaminoidsPolemoniaceae 236 F. Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 (without Acanthogilia).
Exclusion of the continuous characters (topology not shown; ANAL 3) results in a less resolved topology in which only balsaminoids (without Impatiens) and Sapotaceae are monophyletic.
When pedomorphic character states are coded as nonapplicable, parsimony analyses find 38 most parsimonious trees with a length of 106.9 (ANAL 4) (CI 0.28, RI 0.75).
The strict consensus topology (not shown) is somewhat different from Fig.1A: the first diverging lineages are all unresolved, but in the last diverging clades FouquieriaceaeLecythidaceaeEbenaceae are sister to a large clade consisting of balsaminoids, primuloids, Sapotaceae and Cantua.
Within the last diverging group, only Marcgraviaceae, Sapotaceae and Tetrameristaceae are monophyletic.
These three families are also corroborated by bootstrap support values: Marcgraviaceae (76), Sapotaceae (82) and Tetrameristaceae (58).
If the pedomorphic taxa are excluded from the wood analysis, heuristic searches find 38 most parsimonious trees with 105.0 steps (ANAL 5) (CI 0.30, RI 0.73).
The strict consensus (Fig.1B) resembles Fig.1A in the later diverging groups.
In addition, there is another large clade uniting all genera of ericoids, Pentaphylacaceae (without Sladenia), Symplocaceae, and Theaceae plus the genus Acanthogilia.
The bootstrap consensus tree (not shown) resembles the poorly resolved polytomy found in the original analysis.
Molecular analyses (ANAL, 67; Figs 2A and 3) The analysis of the slightly adjusted SEA matrix (ANAL 6), including 59 taxa and 3945 informative characters, results in 101 equally parsimonious trees with length 14 899 (CI 0.43, RI 0.52).
The strict consensus tree (Fig.2A) is similar to strict consensus topology of the combined analyses (Fig.2B) and to the parsimony topology in SEA: balsaminoids are sister to a large polytomy, including Ebenaceaeprimuloids, ericoids, FouquieriaceaePolemoniaceae, Lecythidaceae, Pentaphylacaceae, Sapotaceae, StyracaceaeDiapensiaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae.
The only difference with the SEA strict consensus tree is that the taxonomic position of Symplocaceae is unresolved in our analysis (probably because Symplocos is only included once in our study), and that ActinidiaRoridula and Heliamphora Sarracenia are not resolved as sisters.
The Bayesian analysis of SEA (Fig.3a) shows several additional clades within the large polytomy, such as Sapotaceae Ebenaceaeprimuloids (clade III) and ericoidsSymplocaceaeTheaceaeStyracaceaeDiapensiaceae.
Likewise, the bootstrap consensus tree of ANAL 6 shows these two clades as well, plus an additional relationship between Lecythidaceae and PolemoniaceaeFouquieriaceae (59) (Fig.3B).
Within ericoids, ActinidiaRoridula and HeliamphoraSarracenia form a clade (68) that is fully supported as sister to the other genera.
The strict and the bootstrap consensus trees of our molecular analyses are nearly identical to the trees based on the same matrix plus 23 non-applicable characters (topologies not shown; ANAL 7).
Combined analyses of the molecular original wood matrix (ANAL 810; Figs 2B and 3B) A parsimony analysis of the combined matrix revealed 41 most parsimonious trees with a length of 15 063.7 steps (ANAL 8) (3968 characters are parsimony-informative, CI 0.42, RI 0.52).
The strict consensus tree of ANAL 8 (cf.
Fig.2B; clades indicated by double arrows collapse) is nearly identical to Fig.2A, except for Lecythidaceae(Fouquieriaceae Polemoniaceae), and Ebenaceaeprimuloids.
The bootstrap topology of ANAL 8 strongly resembles the molecular bootstrap topology (ANAL 6; cf.
Fig.3B).
There is also some evidence for one additional clade: Pentaphylacaceae are sister to ericoids, Theaceae and SymplocaceaeStyracaceaeDiapensiaceae (61) forming clade IV (Fig.3B).
The bootstrap support values of the combined data are slightly higher or lower than the values based on molecular data only (Fig.3B).
If the same analysis is carried out without the five continuous characters (chars 3, 4, 6, 15, 16; ANAL 9), the sister relationship between Lecythidaceae and FouquieriaceaePolemoniaceae disappears in the strict consensus tree (not shown).
The bootstrap topologies of the analyses including excluding the continuous data remain the same, but two clades in ANAL 9 receive a slightly higher support value compared with ANAL 8: clade II (65 versus 59) and clade III (66 versus 57).
The consideration of five ordered, non-continuous wood characters into unordered characters (chars 1, 2, 5, 14, 17; ANAL 10) leads again to the disappearance of the relationship between Lecythidaceae and FouquieriaceaePolemoniaceae in the strict consensus tree (topology not shown).
The bootstrap topology and support values are very similar to the original combined analysis (Fig.3B): only clade II receives greater support (67 versus 59).
Combined analyses of the molecular non-pedomorphic wood matrix (ANAL 1114; Figs 2B and 3B) When the pedomorphic character states are not taken into account (cf.
Wiens et al., 2005), 17 most parsimonious trees are found with a length of 15 046.3 (ANAL 11; CI 0.42, RI 0.52).
The strict consensus tree of this analysis (Fig.2B) is similar to the one of the original combined matrix (ANAL 8), and shows improved resolution for the relationships of Impatiens, Ebenaceaeprimuloids, and ActinidiaRoridulaHeliamphora Sarracenia (double arrows in Fig.2B).

Furthermore, the ActinidiaRoridulaHeliamphoraSarracenia clade falls apart into ActinidiaRoridula and Heliamphora Sarracenia, and falls outside ericoids.
The bootstrap topology of ANAL 13 shows similar relationships as in Fig.3B.

Also the bootstrap topology of ANAL 14 (not shown) is very similar, except for the bootstrap values that are somewhat lower compared with ANAL 11 (Fig.3B).
Discussion Wood-based analyses The analyses of the wood matrix alone find trees that largely contradict our current molecular-based insights in the phylogeny of Ericales.
Furthermore, the majority of the families in the wood analysis do not appear monophyletic in the strict consensus topology (Fig.1A), while several molecular studies have demonstrated the opposite (e.g., Anderberg et al., 2002; Schonenberger et al., 2005).
The few families that can be delimited by a unique combination of wood features are Marcgraviaceae [Lens et al., 2005b; vasicentric axial parenchyma (char.
13 state 2), high and wide multiseriate rays with heterocellular body ray cells (chars 15 state 6, 16 states 36, 17 state 1), and raphides (char.
19 state 1)], Tetrameristaceae [Lens et al., 2005b; thick fiber walls (char.
12 state 1), combination of apotracheal and paratracheal axial parenchyma (char.
13 states 0 and 2), and raphides (char.
19 state 1)], and Sapotaceae [Kukachka, 197882; thick fiber walls (char.
12 state 1), banded axial parenchyma (char.
13 state 1), narrow and low multiseriate rays (chars 15 state 0, 16 state 0), and crystal sand (char.
21 state 1)].
One explanation offered for poorly resolved wood phylogenies is that there is an overwhelming amount of noise in a wood matrix (Baas et al., 1988; Zhang, 1992; Noshiro and Baas, 1998; Klaassen, 1999).
The deviating wood topologies can be largely attributed to the correlation of the wood structure with (macro)climatic conditions, and this is most pronounced in vessel characters (chars 2, 3, 4, 8).
It frequently has been discussed that similar ecological factors result in convergent wood anatomical trends andto a lesser extentin reversals that hamper the search for evolutionary relationships (Baas and Wheeler, 1996).
The impact of these trends becomes obvious when the distribution area of the ericalean families is investigated: Fig.1 shows that nearly all families growing in (sub)tropical lowland regions are part of one clade comprising balsaminoids, primuloids, Ebenaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae (largely corresponding to clades I and III in Fig.3B), together with the more xeromorphic Fouquieriaceae and the ecological more variable Polemoniaceae (corresponding to clade II in Fig.3B).
Ecologically adaptive features that character ize this large group are relatively wide vessels that are 100 lm or more in tangential diameter (char.
4 states 5 9) and simple perforations (char.
2 state 2), two features of which especially the former contributes to the efficiency of water transport (Zimmermann, 1983; Ellerby and Ennos, 1998; Schulte, 1999).
This contrasts with the narrower vessels (char.
4 states 04) having scalariform perforations (char.
2 state 0) and helical thickenings (char.
8 state 1) that define clade IV.
Representatives of the latter clade generally grow in (sub)tropical montane to more temperate or even borealarctic areas in which high rates of water conduction are not needed, so a safe xylem transport prevails over an efficient transport (e.g., Baas, 1976; Zimmermann, 1983; Feild and Brodribb, 2001).
The clear ecological trends notwithstanding, clade IV is supported in the total evidence bootstrap topologies (Fig.3B) and alsoto a large extentin the Bayesian topology of SEA (Fig.3A), while the tropical lowland clades IIII form at least two evolutionary lines (Fig.3B).
Furthermore, exclusion of the ecologically adaptive features (ANAL 12) results in a loss of resolution in the strict consensus trees and a decrease of bootstrap values among the major evolutionary lines.
This indicates that ecologically adaptive features possess a supplementary phylogenetic signal, i.e., the adaptation from temperate or tropical montane Cornales-like ancestors towards tropical lowland Ericales lineages prove to coincide with cladogenesis, and therefore these features should not be excluded a priori in phylogenetic analyses (cf.
Luckow and Bruneau, 1997).
In addition to the ecological impact, wood anatomical features also vary with plant habit (Baas, 1976; Carlquist and Hoekman, 1985; Baas and Schweingruber, 1987; Dickison, 2000; Carlquist, 2001a; Lens et al., 2004c).
This might explain why Polemoniaceae (shrubs and vines; Fig.1) are not reconstructed as a monophyletic group in the wood-based phylogeny (Fig.1), and appear not to be closely related to Fouquieriaceae (shrubs to columnar stem succulents; Kubitzki, 2004), despite a strong molecular relationship between both families.
Parsimony analysis of ANAL 1 (Fig.1A) shows another suprafamily clade that corresponds well to molecular phylogenies: balsaminoids (without Impatiens).
The presence of septate fibers (char.
11 state 1), mainly paratracheal axial parenchyma (char.
13 state 2), high multiseriate rays (char.
16 states 69), and the presence of raphides in rays (char.
19 state 1) corroborate their monophyletic origin (Lens et al., 2005b).
It is not surprising that Impatiens does not belong to the balsaminoids in the wood analyses, as the few woody Impatiens species are secondarily woody.
The secondarily derived wood in Impatiens is very clear because of several deviating pedomorphic features: the constant decrease of vessel element length with age (char.
3 state 0), very wide scalariform vessel pits (char.
5 state 0; char.
241F.
Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 6 state 9), and extremely wide (char.
15 state 9) and high multiseriate rays (char.
16 state 9) with exclusively upright ray cells (char.
17 state 2) (Lens et al., 2005b).
Figure 1A shows two additional examples of the misleading effect of pedomorphism on phylogeny reconstruction: (i) the genus Lysimachia is not associated with the other primuloids, and (ii) Empetrum (Ericacaceae) is part of a clade, including two other pedomorphic taxa: Impatiens andHeliamphora.
These peculiar relationships provide evidence for the hypothesis of Carlquist (1962, p. 44) who stated that Phylesis both toward or away from herbaceousness would involve juvenile expressions, so these could not be used as criteria of one ancestry or the other.
Also Wiens et al.(2005, p. 100) commented on the effect of pedomorphosis in his evolutionary study of salamanders: the analysis of pedomorphic species can be problematic because of the absence of cladespecific adult traits that would allow their correct placement, rather than just the misleading presence of larval traits shared among all pedomorphic species.
If the pedomorphic taxa are excluded from the wood matrix, two large clades appear that correspond well to macroclimatic zones (Fig.1B): (i) a largely (sub)tropical lowland clade (corresponding to clades IIII in Fig.3B, except for Acanthogilia), defined by a so-called derived set of wood features in the Baileyan sense [i.e., distinct vessel multiples (char.
1 states 12), simple perforations (char.
2 state 2), alternate intervessel pitting (char.
5 state 4), fibers with simple to minutely bordered pits (char.
10 state 0), and paratracheal or banded apotracheal axial parenchyma (char.
13 states 12)], and (ii) a (sub)tropical montane to more temperate boreal clade (comparable with clade IV in Fig.3B, except for Styracaceae and Sladenia), which can be characterized by a so-called primitive Baileyan syndrome of wood features [solitary vessels (char.
1 state 0), scalariform perforations (char.
2 state 0), mainly opposite to scalariform vessel pitting (char.
5 states 02), fibers with distinctly bordered pits (char.
10 state 1), and diffuse or diffuse-in-aggregates axial parenchyma (char.
13 state 0)] (Bailey and Tupper, 1918; Kribs, 1937; Fig.4).
From a wood anatomical point of view, it is understandable that Styracaceae and Sladenia fall outside the two large clades: they share many features with the second clade (Fig.4), but there are also links with the first clade, such as distinct vessel multiples (char.
1 states 12) and the tendency to alternate intervessel pitting (char.
5 states 34) (Dickison and Phend, 1985; Liang and Baas, 1990).
The recognition of balsaminoids in Fig.1A together with the so-called primitive wood clade in Fig.1B demonstrates that wood anatomical features include phylogenetic signals that can define large evolutionary lines within Ericales.
This corroborates the findings of various wood studies in Ericales at the family tribal level that have demonstrated the systematic usefulness of wood characters in different families (Lens et al., 2003, 2004a,b, 2005a,b, in press), primuloids (Lens et al., 2005a) and balsaminoids (Lens et al., 2005b).
The systematic significance of wood anatomy is not only restricted to Ericales, but has also been demonstrated in many other dicotyledonous groups (e.g., Oleaceae: Baas et al., 1988; Sapindaceae: Klaassen, 1999; eudicots: Jansen et al., 2001; Moringaceae: Olson, 2002).
Combined analyses The inclusion of morphological and molecular data in a combined analysis is widely accepted and encouraged by most systematists, because it generally presents the best way to unravel the phylogeny of a specific group, even if the number of informative morphological characters is swamped by molecular ones (Nixon and Carpenter, 1996; Pennington, 1996; Karehed, 2001; Kress et al., 2001; Evans et al., 2003; Lee, 2004).
In the present study, the small morphological data set has a clear impact on phylogeny reconstruction, indicated by differences between the combined versus molecular topologies.
For example, the strict consensus tree of combined non-pedomorphic analysis (ANAL 11) shows an increased resolution compared with the molecular analysis (ANAL 6) in the relationship of Impatiens, clade II, and ActinidiaRoridula and Heliamphora Sarracenia (single arrows in Fig.2B).
The topology of ANAL 11 differs from ANAL 6 in the following aspects: (i) evidence is found for a sister relationship between Pentaphylacaceae and the other families with a primitive wood structure in the Baileyan sense (ericoidsTheaceaeSymplocaceaeStyracaceaeDiapensiaceae) leading to a monophyletic clade IV (also found in the original combined bootstrap topology), and (ii) several large evolutionary lines are supported by higher bootstrap values (Fig.3B).
The increase in resolution and bootstrap support at higher taxonomic levels in the combined topologies of ANAL 11 compared with the molecular analysis (ANAL 6) can be compared with the improved resolution of the SEA Bayesian topology, which is based on molecular data alone (Fig.3).
The positive effect of this combined analysis offers new evidence to emphasize the systematic importance of wood characters.
Two examples can be cited, i.e., ActinidiaceaeRoridulaceae Sarraceniaceae (77 versus 70), and clade III (65 versus 57) (Fig.3B).
The former clade has already been well established in various molecular studies (Morton et al., 1997; Anderberg et al., 2002; Bremer et al., 2002; Schonenberger et al., 2005), while the latter clade provides further evidence for the controversial taxonomic position of Sapotaceae, which is sometimes linked to Lecythidaceae (Morton et al., 1997; Anderberg et al., 2002).
Another interesting relationship in the combined bootstrap trees of ANAL 11 (and ANAL 8) is that Pentaphylacaceae are sister to rest of clade IV.
242 F. Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 Although this large clade has never been proposed before in molecular analyses, this relationship makes sense from a wood anatomical point of view: nearly all its members are characterized by a unique primitive syndrome of wood features in the Baileyan sense, which is evident in all major cell types (Fig.4).
Moreover, the presence of strong aluminum accumulators (Jansen et al., 2004b) and the occurrence of more than two fertile stamen whorls provides additional morphological evidence for the inclusion of Pentaphylacaceae within clade IV (Fig.4; Caris, personal communication).
It is striking, but not uncommon in woody angiosperms, that so-called primitive wood features are characteristic of relatively derived APG clades at a high taxonomic level, e.g., the asterid orders Aquifoliales (e.g., Baas, 1973), Cornales (Noshiro and Baas, 1998) and Garryales (Noshiro and Baas, 1998).
Other relationships in the combined analyses are more ambiguous.
As demonstrated in our study, the position of Lecythidaceae remains problematic.
Figures 2B and 3B provide evidence for a sister relationship between Lecythidaceae and Polemoniaceae Fouquieriaceae (clade II), an association that has never been proposed before.
However, removal of the five continuous wood characters, or exclusion of the five ecologically adaptive features, or a switch from the five discrete ordered to unordered characters leads to the disappearance of this clade in the strict consensus trees.
Despite the large differences in life form between the three families, there are several wood characters that support clade II, such as simple perforations (char.
2 state 2), relatively short vessel elements (char.
3 states 02), alternate intervessel pits (char.
5 state 4), banded axial parenchyma (char.
13 state 1), and the presence of prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma (char.
20 state 1; absent in Polemoniaceae).
Furthermore, Fouquieria and Napoleonaea share vasicentric tracheids (char.
9 state 1), a feature that is scarce in other ericalean members, except for Sapotaceae (Carlquist et al., 1984; de Zeeuw, 1990; Carlquist, 2001b; Kukachka, 197882; Lens et al., in press).
However, most of these characters are common in clades IIII, and more morphological molecular characters together with many more taxa need to be studied before this relationship can be further established.
Symplocaceae is another family of which the closest relatives remain unresolved.
In the molecular bootstrap analysis, the family is moderately supported as sister to StyracaceaeDiapensiaceae, a placement that agrees with flower characters (Caris et al., 2002; SEA).
From a wood anatomical point of view, Symplocaceae seem more closely related to Theaceae due to the co-occurrence of solitary vessels, and a distinctive combination of aluminum accumulation in the wood (char.
23 state 1; Jansen et al., 2004b) and strongly reduced borders in the vessel-ray pits, although also distinctly bordered vessel-ray pits are present (char.
7 states 01; van den Oever et al., 1981; Liang and Baas, 1990, 1991).
The strict consensus trees of the combined parsimony analyses of the data sets without the continuous characters (ANAL 9, 13) show similar but slightly less resolved topologies compared with the total evidence analyses (ANAL 8, 11).
For instance, clade II disappears in ANAL 9 and 13, and the relationship between Ebenaceae and primuloids collapses in ANAL 13.
Bootstrap topologies also remain similar, but, surprisingly, support values in ANAL 9 and 13 increase for several clades compared with the total evidence analyses: clade II (65 versus 59) and clade III (66 versus 57) receive higher support in ANAL 9, and Pentaphylacaceae (83 versus 76) and clade IV without Pentaphylacaceae (74 versus 67) shows higher support in ANAL 13.
Evolution of wood characters in Ericales In order to trace the evolutionary patterns of the wood structure in Ericales, selected wood characters with potential systematic value are plotted on the combined non-pedomorphic bootstrap topology (Fig.4).
The fact that morphological data are plotted on a tree that is partly based on the same features does not necessarily assume circular reasoning.
It is more important that the characters included in the matrix are all independent, and that they possess potential phylogenetic information (for a detailed discussion, see Luckow and Bruneau, 1997).
One must also take into account that the phylogenetic trees only show the wood diversity of the ericalean taxa included (55 versus 357).
For more details on the separate lineages, we refer to wood anatomical papers in the list of references.
The so-called primitive wood structure in Cornales (represented by Cornus and Hydrangea in the outgroup) is nearly identical to the anatomy present in clade IV in vessel (chars 2 state 0, 3 states 39, 4 states 04, 5 states 03, 8 state 1) and fiber morphology (char.
10 state 1), axial parenchyma distribution (char.
13 state 0), and uniseriate rays incidence (char.
14 state 0) (Fig.4).
As the position of balsaminoids as sister to the other ericalean lineages is strongly supported, the evolution towards a derived wood structure must have occurred at least twice depending on the ambiguous relationship between clades II, III and IV.
As mentioned before, the adaptation of cornaleanericalean ancestors from more temperate and boreal arctic regions into warm tropical lowland forests is probably the driving force behind the convergent evolution to so-called derived vessel elements (shorter and wider cells with simple perforations and alternate pitting; chars 2 state 2, 3 states 02, 4 states 59, 5 state 4), fibers with simple to minutely bordered pits (char.
10 state 0), and banded or paratracheal parenchyma (char.
13 states 12) (Bailey and Tupper, 1918; Kribs, 1937; Carlquist, 2001a).

Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 The majority consensus trees of the molecular (ANAL 6) and combined non-pedomorphic analyses (ANAL 11) find conflicting hypotheses for the ambiguous relationships between clades II, III and IV: ANAL 11 shows evidence for a sister relationship between clades II and III (81%), but ANAL 6 finds much more parsimonious trees in which clades III and IV are sisters (77%).
From a wood anatomical point of view, it is most unlikely that there has been a massive reversal from the derived to the primitive condition in the common ancestor of clade IV, even if this massive reversal would be a more or equally parsimonious way to explain character evolution.
Therefore, we favor the retention hypothesis, in which we state that the so-called primitive wood structure in clade IV is a retention of the primitive anatomy present in Cornales.
In this retention scenario, the relationships proposed in the majority consensus tree of ANAL 11 imply only two (instead of three in ANAL 6) convergent evolutionary lines to the derived condition: one to clade I, and one to the sister clades IIIII.
Evidence from fossils and DNA sequence data demonstrate that the diversification into the two ericalean wood types most likely has taken place relatively shortly after the origin of Ericales, allowing most evolutionary lines in clades IIII to develop distinct wood features (Sytsma et al., 2006) (Fig.4).
For example, balsaminoids (clade I) and primuloids (clade III) can be characterized by septate fibers (char.
11 state 1), and high multiseriate rays (char.
16 states 69) with heterocellular body ray cells (char.
17 state 1), but they clearly differ in the presence of mineral inclusions [raphides (char.
19 state 1) versus prismatic crystals (char.
18 state 1) or silica bodies (char.
22 state 1)].
In addition, the families Ebenaceae, Sapotaceae (both clade III) and Lecythidaceae (clade II) share banded axial parenchyma (char.
13 state 1), low (char.
16 states 01) and narrow multiseriate rays (char.
15 states 02) with exclusively procumbent body ray cells (char.
17 state 0), and prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma (char.
20 state 1), but they can be distinguished from each other based on the presence of vasicentric tracheids (char.
9 state 1) and crystal sand (both typical of Sapotaceae; char.
21 state 1), the presence of two types of vessel-ray pitting (unique to Sapotaceae and Lecythidaceae; char.
7 state 2), and the tendency to form opposite to alternate intervessel pitting (Ebenaceae; char.
5 state 3) (Fig.4).
The wood diversity within clade IV is much lower: only Theaceae and many Symplocaceae can be distinguished anatomically from the other representatives by the occurrence of vessel-ray pitting with much reduced borders (char.
7 state 1).
There are some exceptions to the characterization of two major wood types at a lower taxonomic level, which is caused by differences in habitat, life form and secondary woodiness (Fig.4).
The impact of different habitats is clear in the typical tropical lowland clades IIII: the common vessel type (relatively large diameter and predominantly simple perforations) is not present in the (sub)montane tropical genera Impatiens, Lissocarpa, Norantea and Pentamerista, which is a confirmation for the generally accepted ecological trends in wood (e.g., Baas, 1976; Carlquist, 2001a).
Furthermore, the effect of differences in life form may provide an explanation why the vessel morphology between clades IIII and clade IV differs: relatively wide vessel elements (char.
4 states 59) with simple perforations (char.
2 state 2) are common in clades IIII because of the abundance of tall trees, while narrow vessels with scalariform perforations are typical of clade IV in which shrubs and small trees are dominant (e.g., Baas, 1976).
Genera that have an atypical life form compared with the other members of the same clade often show differences in vessel diameter and or the type of perforation (Fig.4).
For example, mixed scalariform simple perforations (char.
2 state 1) occur always in Napoleonaea (clade II), a typical member of the understorey vegetation in tropical West Africa.
Also other Lecythidaceae that grow in the same understorey vegetation type, such as Brazzeia, Pierrina and Rhaptopetalum, have the same mixed perforation type (Carlquist, 1988; Lens et al., in press).
Other examples that illustrate the impact of habit are relatively wide vessels in climbing Actinidia species (clade IV; char.
4 state 7; Carlquist, 1989a) and in tall trees of Bruinsmia (clade IV; char.
4 state 7; Dickison and Phend, 1985), while narrow vessels are present in shrubs to small trees of Acanthogilia, Cantua, Clavija, Fouquieria and Lysimachia (members of clades IIII; char.
4 states 01; Carlquist et al., 1984; Carlquist, 2001b; Lens et al., 2005a).
The effect of secondary woodiness on the evolution of wood characters in Ericales has already been discussed in previous paragraphs.
The genus that shows the most pedomorphic characters is Impatiens (chars 3, 56, 12, 1517).
The fact that all pedomorphic taxa included have narrow vessels (char.
4 states 02) is not surprising because they are represented by small woody herbs or tiny shrubs.
In the lianous genus Cobaea (clade II), the pedomorphic impact blurs the typical climbing anatomy, which is illustrated by relatively narrow vessel elements and the absence of rays (Carlquist et al., 1984; Carlquist, 1989a).
Conclusions The wood structure of the highly diverse order Ericales contains phylogenetically important information, despite homoplasious trends caused by ecological adaptations, habit and secondary woodiness.
Combined 244 F. Lens et al./Cladistics 23 (2007) 229254 wood molecular matrices, including <1% wood anatomical characters and with pedomorphic character states coded as inapplicable, lead to an improved resolution and support of the bootstrap topology as compared with the molecular analyses.
Taxonomically useful features are vessel grouping, vessel perforation type, intervessel and vessel-ray pitting, axial parenchyma distribution, fiber type, frequency of uniseriate rays, shape of body ray cells and type of mineral inclusions.
The wood anatomical diversity within Ericales can be divided into two wood types: (i) members growing in tropical montane or more temperate to arctic regions show a primitive type that probably has evolved with little change from the more basal outgroup Cornales, and (ii) tropical lowland taxa possess a derived type that has evolved at least twice in separate evolutionary lines.
We hope that this paper encourages other wood anatomists morphologists to carry out combined cladistic analyses, even when the number of morphological characters represents only a fraction of the total amount of data.
