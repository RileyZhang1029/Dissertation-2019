Negative controls (NCs) (PRKACB and ZP4) are regions that had very low levels of histone by Illumina GAII sequencing and/or array data.
Fold enrichment of histone at these promoters was determined by MNase signal divided by the total genomic DNA signal b, Fold enrichment of H3K4me3 was determined by normalizing signal from the H3K4me3 IP eluate to the signal from MNase (histone pool).
Two maternally-imprinted loci in sperm were used as negative controls.
c, H3K27me3 and d, H3K9me3 enrichment were determined as described above.
H3K9me3 positive controls (PCs) were two pericentromeric heterochromatin loci.
e, qPCR testing of MeDIP data.
Enriched loci from MeDIP arrays were binned into the top 100 regions or 400 enriched regions.
qPCR of MeDIP eluates were performed for the bottom 10 regions in each of the top 100 and 400 bins.
Since all 20 regions enriched for DNA methylation, a cutoff of the top 400 genes (approximately 2-fold) was our stringent cutoff for DNA methylation.
qPCR fold enrichment was compared to input (total sheared genomic DNA).
Positive controls were two known methylated (imprinted) regions and negative controls were regions that are demethylated in sperm when compared to fibroblast.

Negative controls (NCs) (PRKACB and ZP4) are regions that had very low levels of histone by Illumina GAII sequencing and/or array data.
Fold enrichment of histone at these promoters was determined by MNase signal divided by the total genomic DNA signal b, Fold enrichment of H3K4me3 was determined by normalizing signal from the H3K4me3 IP eluate to the signal from MNase (histone pool).
Two maternally-imprinted loci in sperm were used as negative controls.
c, H3K27me3 and d, H3K9me3 enrichment were determined as described above.
H3K9me3 positive controls (PCs) were two pericentromeric heterochromatin loci.
e, qPCR testing of MeDIP data.
Enriched loci from MeDIP arrays were binned into the top 100 regions or 400 enriched regions.
qPCR of MeDIP eluates were performed for the bottom 10 regions in each of the top 100 and 400 bins.
Since all 20 regions enriched for DNA methylation, a cutoff of the top 400 genes (approximately 2-fold) was our stringent cutoff for DNA methylation.
qPCR fold enrichment was compared to input (total sheared genomic DNA).
Positive controls were two known methylated (imprinted) regions and negative controls were regions that are demethylated in sperm when compared to fibroblast.
