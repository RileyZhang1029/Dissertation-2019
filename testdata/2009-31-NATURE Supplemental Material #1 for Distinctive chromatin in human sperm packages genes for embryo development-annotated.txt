Enriched loci from MeDIP arrays were binned into the top 100 regions or 400 enriched regions.
qPCR of MeDIP eluates were performed for the bottom 10 regions in each of the top 100 and 400 bins.
Since all 20 regions enriched for DNA methylation, a cutoff of the top 400 genes (approximately 2-fold) was our stringent cutoff for DNA methylation. qPCR fold enrichment was compared to input (total sheared genomic DNA). Positive controls were two known methylated (imprinted) regions and negative controls were regions that are demethylated in sperm when compared to fibroblast.

Brown bars are the normalized difference scores for pooled donor H2A.Z across chromosome 16, and in orange is the FDR. Other chromosomes showed similar peaks flanking the centromere. Pericentric heterochromatin was highly enriched with H2A.Z (FDR 0.05). www.nature.com/nature 7  doi: 10.1038/nature08162 sequencing.
