A R T I C L E S E2 BRCA1 RING interactions dictate synthesis of mono- or speciﬁc polyubiquitin chain linkages Devin E Christensen, Peter S Brzovic & Rachel E Klevit An E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates the transfer of activated ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to its substrate lysine residues.
Using a structure-based, yeast two-hybrid strategy, we discovered six previously unidentiﬁed interactions between the human heterodimeric RING E3 BRCA1-BARD1 and the human E2s UbcH6, Ube2e2, UbcM2, Ubc13, Ube2k and Ube2w. All six E2s bind directly to the BRCA1 RING motif and are active with BRCA1-BARD1 for autoubiquitination in vitro. Four of the E2s direct monoubiquitination of BRCA1. Ubc13-Mms2 and Ube2k direct the synthesis of Lys63- or Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains on BRCA1 and require an acceptor ubiquitin attached to BRCA1. Differences between the mono- and polyubiquitination activities of the BRCA1-interacting E2s correlate with their ability to bind ubiquitin noncovalently at a site distal to the active site.
Thus, BRCA1 has the ability to direct the synthesis of speciﬁc polyubiquitin chain linkages, depending on the E2 bound to its RING.
Inherited germline mutations of the human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility protein BRCA1 predispose an individual to early onset of breast and ovarian tumors.
The only biochemical activity associated with BRCA1 is found at its RING domain, which functions as a ubiquitin ligase. Numerous cancer-associated BRCA1 missense muta- tions occur within the RING domain1, and these eliminate ubiquitin ligase activity.
Hence, loss of ubiquitin ligase activity in the RING domain of BRCA1 is closely associated with breast-cancer suscepti- bility. We therefore set out to further deﬁne the function of this BRCA1 domain during the process of ubiquitination. An E3 ubiquitin ligase functions at the crossroad between activation of ubiquitin and its covalent attachment to substrate proteins.
The process is initiated by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, which activates the C-terminal Gly76 of ubiquitin and transfers it to the active site cysteine of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
Speciﬁcity for ubiquitina- tion is believed to be dictated primarily by an E3, which binds both an E2 ubiquitin complex and a substrate to mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to a lysine residue on the E3-bound substrate.
Identiﬁcation of the substrates of an E3 and the type of ubiquitin modiﬁcation that it synthesizes on those substrates is important in understanding the function of the E3. However, identifying substrates of an E3 is not straightforward, as the mechanisms underlying substrate speciﬁcity, E2-E3 interactions, and selection of polyubiquitin linkage types are not well understood.
Some of these processes might be determined by the E2. For example, certain E2s function in the synthesis of speciﬁc ubiquitin chain linkages the Ubc13-Mms2 heterodimer2,3 and Ube2k4 direct the synthesis of Lys63- or Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, respectively.
There are over 30 E2s encoded in the human genome, and, similar to Ube2k and Ubc13-Mms2, each has the potential to play a unique role in the process of ubiquitination. The type of ubiquitin modiﬁcation that can occur on a substrate may depend on the E2 with which the E3 associates.
Understanding the function of an E3 therefore depends in part on knowledge of the E2s with which it interacts.
An absolute requirement for a functional E2-E3 pair in any context is a direct physical interaction between them.
E2-E3 interactions are believed to be highly selective, with only a single E2 expected to function with a given E3, despite a growing number of reports of an E3 interacting with more than one E2 (refs. 5 7). Deﬁning the complement of E2s that can interact with a given E3 may provide a practical advantage for identifying putative substrates of that E3 and the type of ubiquitin modiﬁcation that can be attached to the substrate.
It is likely that many E3s have more than one substrate, and there is no guarantee that each E2 capable of interaction with the E3 will transfer ubiquitin to every substrate.
Thus, a strategy capable of identifying all interacting E2-E3 pairs based on binding would provide the crucial subset of all possible E2s that should be considered in future studies of that E3. Common approaches for identifying protein-protein interactions, such as co-immunoprecipitation or pull-down assays, may not be effective for evaluating all E2-E3 pairings, as E2-E3 interactions are transient and of modest afﬁnity. To overcome the difﬁculties in identifying weakly associating E2-E3 pairs, we designed a yeast two-hybrid strategy based on the three- dimensional structure of the heterodimeric RING E3 BRCA1-BARD1 and used it to identify E2-BRCA1 interactions.
Speciﬁcally, a fused human BRCA1-BARD1 bait construct was used to screen a library of human E2 prey constructs.
The screen identiﬁed not only the known interacting E2 partners for BRCA1-BARD1, UbcH5 and UbcH7 (ref. 1), but also six new E2 partners for BRCA1.

Comparison of the functional E2s deﬁned residues important for recognition by BRCA1, which provide a mechanistic rationale that distinguishes BRCA1-interacting E2s that build polyubiquitin chains from those that transfer a single ubiquitin. We also show that E2 proteins can function synergistically to build speciﬁc chain linkages, as E2s such as the Ubc13-Mms2 heterodimer selectively build Lys63-linked chains on a monoubiquitinated substrate in a BRCA1- dependent fashion.
These results suggest a potential division of labor among the various E2 proteins and provide a direct functional link for BRCA1 in the process of DNA repair.
(Fig. 1b). To conﬁrm that the fusion protein retained both structure and function, we expressed it in bacteria and puriﬁed and tested it in a substrate-independent assay with UbcH5c. The ubiquitin ligase activity of BD126FBC109 was identical to that of its nonfused counter- part, BC112-BD140 (BRCA1 residues 1 112 and BARD1 residues 26 140 Supplementary Fig.1 online). The 1H,15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of the fusion protein is highly similar to that of the non- fused heterodimer, conﬁrming the structural integrity of the hetero- dimer fusion construct (Supplementary Fig.1). BD126FBC109 was therefore fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 to generate our yeast two-hybrid bait.
RESULTS Design of a structure-based BRCA1-BARD1 bait Structural studies of E2-E3 complexes have revealed the E2-interacting regions for E3s with RING, U-box and HECT domains7 9.
In the case of the heterodimeric BRCA1-BARD1, the RING motif of BRCA1 interacts directly with the E2s UbcH5c and UbcH7, although only UbcH5c shows activity in either substrate-independent or auto- ubiquitination assays1. Although no physical interactions between UbcH5c or UbcH7 and the BARD1 RING were detected, the N-terminal portion of BARD1 is required for the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 (ref. 10), indicating that it is the heterodimeric structure that imparts functional activity.
A directed yeast two-hybrid experi- ment in which only the BRCA1 subunit was used as bait did not result in a positive interaction with a UbcH5c prey construct (Fig. 1a), consistent with the idea that structural integrity of the heterodimeric RING is crucial.
We therefore designed a fused version of the BRCA1- BARD1 RING heterodimer that would present a structurally relevant bait molecule in the context of a yeast two-hybrid experiment.
Design of the fusion protein was based on the BRCA1-BARD1 RING-RING heterodimer structure, comprising the ﬁrst B110 resi- dues of each subunit11. In the solution structure, the C-terminal end of the BARD1 RING domain is within 10 A of the N-terminal end of the BRCA1 subunit. A Gly2-Ser-Gly2 linker was used to link the RING domain of BARD1 (residues 26 126) to the RING domain of BRCA1 (residues 2 109) to create the fusion construct BD126FBC109 As proof of principle, BD126FBC109 was tested for interaction with UbcH5c in a directed yeast two-hybrid screen.
The BD126FBC109 bait showed an interaction with the UbcH5c prey, whereas a bait compris- ing the identical BRCA1 residues alone was unable to support growth (Fig. 1a). The BRCA1-alone bait supported growth in the presence of a BARD1 prey, conﬁrming that this bait molecule is capable of protein-protein interactions.
Inclusion of the ligase-inactive BRCA1 RING mutation I26A (which disrupts the interaction with UbcH5c and UbcH7)1, construct BD126FBC109-I26A, abrogated the two-hybrid interaction with UbcH5c (Fig. 1a). Together, these results conﬁrm that the bait design recapitulates the salient features of the BRCA1-BARD1 E3 interaction with the E2 UbcH5c, namely that the interaction requires the intact heterodimeric structure and can be disrupted by the I26A mutation.
context of fused bait in the the Identiﬁcation of BRCA1-interacting E2s To identify additional human E2s that can interact with BRCA1- BARD1, we used BD126FBC109 as bait in a directed yeast two-hybrid screen with 24 human E2s and six human ubiquitin-conjugating E2 variants (UEVs) as prey.
Growth of yeast cells on selective medium in the presence of BD126FBC109 above the background level of the empty-vector controls was supported by 11 E2s: UbcH5a (also called Ube2d1), UbcH5b (Ube2d2), UbcH5c (Ube2d3), UbcH6 (Ube2e1), Ube2e2, UbcM2 (Ube2e3), Ube2k (E2-25K), UbcH7 (Ube2l3), Ubc13 (Ube2n1), Ubc9 (Ube2i), and Ube2w (Fig. 1c and Supple- mentary Fig.2 online).
