The system was able to produce protein at a rate of about 160 µg/ml/h in a batch mode without the need for any supplementary apparatus.
The protein products were easily purified within 1 h using affinity chromatography to remove the tagged protein factors.
Moreover, omission of a release factor allowed efficient incorporation of an unnatural amino acid using suppressor transfer RNA (tRNA). The development of cell-free strategies based on purified enzymes is an expanding field in biotechnology.
DNA polymerases have made it possible to amplify DNA rapidly and efficiently by PCR without the need for cloning.
RNA polymerases are used to synthesize novel RNA molecules through in vitro evolution methods.
Reverse tran- scriptases generate complementary DNA (cDNA), which does not exist in natural living systems.
The availability of these purified enzymes essential to the central-dogma pathway of molecular biol- ogy has removed many of the constraints in conventional gene- manipulation techniques that rely on living cells.
So far, however, the translation process has eluded efficient reconstitution in vitro, in large part because of its complexity.
The achievement of this goal would offer advantages in many areas of biotechnology.
Two approaches have guided efforts to achieve cell-free transla- tion. One approach, developed over the past decade, is based on crude cell extract, often derived from Escherichia coli, rabbit reticulo- cytes, or wheat germ1,2. But the use of such extracts inevitably encounters two problems: a rapid depletion of energy charge, inde- pendent of peptide bond formation3,4, and degradation of protein products or template nucleic acids by proteases or nucleases. These problems have been partly overcome by a continuous-flow cell-free protein-synthesis system5,6. The second approach attempts to reconstitute protein synthesis from purified components of the translation machinery.
More than 100 molecules participate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation, many of which have been individually purified for biochemical stud- ies of their functions and structures.
In 1977, Weissbach s group endeavored to reconstitute a translation system using purified solu- ble components7 but did not achieve a satisfactory production of proteins, perhaps because of a complex purification protocol and the absence of release factor 3 (RF3) and ribosome-recycling factor (RRF). A few years later, Ganoza and co-workers reconstructed a cell-free translation system from precharged aminoacyl-tRNAs and purified translation factors8. Although this system did not require aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the tRNAs were not recycled, resulting in low productivity.
More recently, Pavlov and co-workers produced an in vitro translation system using a partially purified aminoacyl- tRNA synthetase mixture with purified translation factors9. They also constructed a completely purified in vitro translation system using short artificial messenger RNA (mRNA)10. However, this sys- tem lacked a full set of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and its produc- tivity was relatively low.
Here we describe a cell-free translation system reconstructed from purified histidine (His)-tagged translation factors and  pro- grammed by natural mRNA. The system termed the protein syn- thesis using recombinant elements (PURE) system contains all necessary translation factors, purified with high specific activity, and allows efficient protein production.
We succeeded in producing active dihydrofolic acid reductase (DHFR) with a productivity on the order of submilligrams in a 1 ml reaction volume.
The PURE sys- tem is also advantageous in terms of product purification.
Protein products in the native form (with no His tag) were purified easily and rapidly through ultrafiltration followed by affinity chromatog- raphy to remove the His-tagged translation factors.
Omission of release factor 1 (RF1) allowed the suppression of an amber codon using chemically synthesized UAG-specific suppressor tRNA with a chemically attached valine (Val tRNAsup), demonstrating that the PURE system can be used for the efficient synthesis of proteins con- taining unnatural amino acids.
Results The PURE system.
Protein biosynthesis proceeds in three steps: ini- tiation, elongation, and termination.
In E. coli, the translation factors responsible for completing these steps are three initiation factors (IF1, IF2, and IF3), three elongation factors (EF-G, EF-Tu, and EF- Ts), and three release factors (RF1, RF2, and RF3), as well as RRF for termination.
However, RF2 is not required for the translation of genes terminating with the codons UAG or UAA. The PURE system includes 32 components that we purified individually: IF1, IF2, IF3, EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts, RF1, RF3, RRF, 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs), methionyl-tRNA transformylase (MTF), T7 RNA poly- merase, and ribosomes. In addition, the system contains 46 tRNAs, NTPs, creatine phosphate, 10-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid, 20 amino acids, creatine kinase, myokinase, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, and pyrophosphatase. Purification of translation factors.
We overexpressed in E. coli and purified IF1, IF2, IF3, EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts, RF1, RF3, RRF, 20 ARSs, MTF, and T7 RNA polymerase. We reconstructed these genes in the 1Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, and 2Department of Integrated Biosciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bldg FSB401, 5-1-5, Kasiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba prefecture 277-8562, Japan.

Complete peptide release was dependent on the presence of RF1 (Table 1). The addition of RRF signifi- cantly increased the amount of peptide released and gave multiple-turnover protein synthesis.
The observation that the turnover rate mediated by RF1 and RRF was enhanced by supplementation with RF3 indicated that RF3 was puri- fied as the active form.
From the results of the two experi- ments, we concluded that all the puri- fied translation components were active despite the His tags.
Additonal information about the cloning vectors used for expression of the translation factors and enzymes, the yields following purification, the con- centrations and specific activities of the purified proteins, and the units used per 50 µl reaction is available on the Web Extras page of Nature Biotechnology Online.
Protein synthesis.
We next addressed the construction of the transcription/translation-coupled PURE system using the purified translation components and T7 RNA polymerase. The PURE sys- tem was able to synthesize DHFR of E. coli, λ-lysozyme, green fluo- rescent protein (GFP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and bacte- riophage T7 gene 10 product as full-length polypeptides (Fig. 2). Except for GST, more than 100 µg of each protein was produced in a 1 ml reaction volume after 1 h (Fig. 2). Although we could not explain the low production of GST, we concluded that the PURE system contains all the components essential for translation.
We measured the enzymatic activity of the DHFR, the bacteri- olytic ability of the λ-lysozyme, and the GFP fluorescence, and Figure 1.
