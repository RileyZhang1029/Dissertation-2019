C/EBP�-Rb-E2F4 Complex Represses the c-myc Promoter after Partial Hepatectomy in Livers of Old Animals (A) A failure of old rat livers to reduce C/EBP� after PH correlates with the lack of c-myc induction. Proteins extracts from livers of young and old rats were isolated at different time points after PH (indicated on the top), and examined for the expression of C/EBP�, c-myc, Jun B, Brm, Rb, and E2F4. Protein loading was verified by reprobing the membranes with � actin. (B) Old mouse livers also fail to reduce protein levels of C/EBP� and do not induce c-myc in response to PH. Expression of the proteins (shown on the left) was examined in young and old mouse livers after partial hepatectomy by Western blotting.

Although Brm is observed in the complexes with C/EBP�, weIn young animals, cyclins E and A replace C/EBP� from cdk2 and activate cdk2. cdk2 phosphorylates Rb and could not detect Brm on E2F-dependent promoters in vivo. One possible scenario is that Brm is required for thereleases Rb-mediated repression of the c-myc pro-moter. In old animals, however, c-myc is repressed by formation of the C/EBP�-Rb-E2F4 complex, and then is removed from the complex after binding to E2F promot-the C/EBP�-Rb-E2F4 complex.
