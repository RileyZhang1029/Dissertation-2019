Awad,1,2 and Nikolai A. Timchenko1,* 1Huffington Center on Aging and Department of Pathology 2 Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery Baylor College of Medicine One Baylor Plaza Houston, Texas 77030 Summary The liver is capable of completely regenerating itself in response to injury and after partial hepatectomy. In liver of old animals, the proliferative response is dramatically reduced, the mechanism for which is un- known.
The liver specific protein, C/EBP , normally arrests proliferation of hepatocytes through inhibiting cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). We present evidence that aging switches the liver-specific pathway of C/EBP growth arrest to repression of E2F transcrip- tion. We identified an age-specific C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex that binds to E2F-dependent promoters and represses these genes.
The C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 com- plex occupies the c-myc promoter and blocks induc- tion of c-myc in livers of old animals after partial hepa- tectomy. Our results show that the age-dependent switch from cdk inhibition to repression of E2F tran- scription causes a loss of proliferative response in the liver because of an inability to induce E2F target genes after partial hepatectomy providing a possible mecha- nism for the age-dependent loss of liver regenerative capacity.
Introduction The removal of a portion of liver (partial hepatectomy, PH) leads to initiation of liver proliferation and to a final restoration of the original mass (Fausto and Webber, 1994). It has been shown that livers of old animals have a reduced proliferative response, which is characterized by a significant delay in cell cycle entry and by a signifi- cant reduction of the number of proliferating hepato- cytes (Bucher et al., 1964 Fry et al., 1984 Timchenko et al., 1998). A molecular basis for the loss of proliferative capacity in old livers has not been identified.
Liver prolif- eration after PH requires an orchestrated cascade of gene expression, which includes: (1) the activation of a num- ber of transcription factors, (2) the induction of proteins that drive cell cycle progression, and (3) downregulation of proteins that inhibit cell proliferation (Fausto, 2000 Taub, 1996). At very early stages of liver proliferation initiated by PH, the transcription factors Stat-3, NF-kB, and C/EBP are activated mainly through posttransla- tional modifications (Taub, 1996). Then, the temporary induction of cyclins D1, E, and A activates cdk4 and cdk2. Cdk2 and cdk4 phosphorylate Rb family proteins, *Correspondence: nikolait@bcm.tmc.edu leading to a release of E2F transcription factors followed by activation of S phase and mitotic specific genes by E2F (Fausto, 2000). In addition to these events, several growth inhibitory proteins must be reduced after PH to allow cell prolifera- tion. One of these proteins, a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors C/EBP , is expressed at high levels in liver (Birkenmeier et al., 1989) and maintains liver quiescence (Wang et al., 2001 Timchenko et al., 1997). Livers of newborn C/EBP knockout mice have an increased rate of proliferation, demonstrating that C/EBP is required for the inhibition of liver proliferation (Timchenko et al., 1997). Molecular mechanisms of C/EBP -mediated growth arrest have been the subject of intensive investigations during the last ten years how- ever, only recent observations shed light on some as- pects of the growth inhibition.
Numerous attempts to identify cell cycle-related transcriptional targets of C/EBP were unsuccessful.
It was recently demon- strated that although C/EBP is a transcription factor, its growth inhibitory activity in liver of young animals is mediated through direct interaction with cdks (Wang et al., 2001, 2002). In adipose and myeloid tissues, the antiproliferative effect of C/EBP is mediated through repression of E2F-dependent transcription (Porse et al., 2001). The block of C/EBP -dependent repression of E2F-target genes causes an adipose hypoplasia and myeloid dysplasia, but does not affect liver functions (Porse et al., 2001) showing that the pathway of C/EBP growth arrest in the liver differs from that operating in adipose tissues.
In this paper, we present evidence that aging switches the C/EBP pathway of growth arrest in liver from cdk inhibition to repression of E2F transcription.
Aging in- creases levels of a chromatin remodeling protein Brm, which in turn interacts with C/EBP and initiates the formation of a high MW complex: C/EBP -Rb-E2F4. This age-specific C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex binds to pro- moters regulated by E2F and represses expression of these genes in quiescent and regenerating livers of old animals.
We present evidence that the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex blocks the activation of the c-myc promoter in old livers after PH and in tissue culture models.
Our data provide a molecular basis for the reduced proliferative response in old livers the switch of the C/EBP growth arrest pathway from inhibition of cdks to repression of E2F transcription leads to a failure of the old livers to eliminate the growth inhibitory activity of C/EBP. Results Old Animals Contain a High Molecular Weight C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm Complex We have shown that the loss of proliferative response in old livers correlates with a failure to reduce protein levels of C/EBP (Timchenko et al., 1998). Because C/EBP inhibits cell proliferation through protein-pro- tein interactions (Wang et al., 2001), we suggested that the high levels of C/EBP might interfere with cell cycle  Cell 496 Figure 1.

progression through its interaction with cell cycle pro- teins. We examined protein-protein interactions of C/EBP in livers of old rats and compared them with that observed in livers of young animals.
HPLC-based gel-filtration technique was applied for these studies.
Figure 1A shows a reproducible result of the gel-filtration assay of proteins from livers of young and old rats.
In young animals, C/EBP is observed in fractions with molecular weight ranging from 100 to 300 kDa, while in nuclear extracts of old animals C/EBP is located in gel-filtration fractions with MW ranging from 400 kDa to 680 kDa (Figure 1A). Treatment of the nuclear extracts with DNase I before the fractionation does not alter the location of C/EBP in gel-filtration fractions (data not shown) suggesting that the shift of C/EBP into higher MW gel-filtration fractions is mediated by interactions with other proteins.
In addition to cdk2 and cdk4, C/EBP interacts with Rb family proteins (Chen et al., 1996 Timchenko et al., 1999a), E2F transcription factors (Johansen et al., 2001), and with a chromatin remodeling protein Brm (Pedersen et al., 2001). Therefore, we examined whether these pro- teins colocalize with C/EBP in the high MW gel-filtra- tion fractions.
In old animals, we observed colocalization of C/EBP , E2F4, Rb, and Brm in high MW fractions, while in young animals C/EBP does not colocalize with these proteins in high MW fractions (Figures 1A and 1B). The colocalization of C/EBP with these proteins is specific for C/EBP , since another member of C/EBP family, C/EBP , is observed only in low MW fractions (Figure 1B). To examine whether the colocalization of E2F4, Rb, and Brm with C/EBP in high MW fractions is due to direct interactions, IP-Western experiments with the gel-filtration fractions were performed.
As can be seen in Figure 1B, Brm is bound to C/EBP , sug- gesting the existence of C/EBP -Brm complexes.
We also detected association of Rb with C/EBP in high MW fractions (data not shown and see Figure 4). We have previously found that, in young livers, C/EBP as- sociates with cdk2 (Wang et al., 2001). The analysis of cdk2 in C/EBP IPs from gel-filtration fractions showed that C/EBP is not associated with cdk2 in old livers (Figure 1B, bottom). We have performed the gel-filtration analysis of 6 livers of 24-month-old rats and 7 livers of 22 24-month-old mice and equal numbers of young (6 8 months) rats and young (4 6 months) mice.
In livers of  Aging Alters Pathways of C/EBP Growth Arrest 497 old animals, we reproducibly observed the formation of the age-specific complex.
To further characterize this complex, we applied a simple coimmunoprecipitation procedure.
As can be seen in Figure 1C, amounts of all of these proteins are increased in C/EBP IPs from old animals.
In addition to the increase of total amounts of Rb associated with C/EBP , we also observed the enrichment of hyper- phosphorylated forms of Rb in C/EBP IPs from old animals (Figure 1C). The analysis of C/EBP IPs with antibodies specific to ph-Ser-780 (cyclinD/cdk4 phos- phorylation site) and with antibodies to ph-T-821 (cyclin E-cdk2 phosphorylation site) showed that the phosphor- ylated form of Rb contains ph-Ser-780. In agreement with Co-IP results, GST-pull-down assay shows that Brm, Rb, and E2F4 all interact with GST-C/EBP in ex- tracts from old animals better than in extracts from young animals (Figure 1D). Thus, gel filtration, Co-IP, and GST-pull-down assays show that the major portion of C/EBP in old animals exists in a complex with Rb, E2F4, and Brm. Induction of Brm in Livers of Old Animals Leads to the Appearance of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4- Brm Complex We next investigated the mechanism that leads to the increase of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex in livers of old animals.
First, we examined total levels of all compo- nents by Western blotting.
A representative result of these studies is shown in Figure 2A. Protein levels of C/EBP , Rb, and E2F4 are similar in quiescent livers of young and old animals.
However, protein levels of Brm are significantly increased in livers of old animals.
Calcula- tions of Brm levels as a ratio to  actin show a 3- to 4-fold induction in livers of old rats and a 4-to 5-fold induction in livers of old mice (Figure 2B). Given that Brm and a highly homologous protein Brg1 are redundant (Reyes et al., 1998), we also examined protein levels of Brg1 in young and old livers.
Western blotting shows that Brg1 levels are not changed in old livers (Figure 2A). Because the increase of Brm expression correlates with the appearance of the age specific C/EBP com- plex, we suggested that the elevation of Brm is responsi- ble for the appearance of the complex in old livers.
To test this suggestion, we purified mouse Brm protein from livers of old animals using a combination of HPLC- based chromatography columns (see Experimental Pro- cedures). Figure 2C shows the analysis of C/EBP com- plexes in young livers before and after incubation with Brm. In agreement with previous observations, C/EBP is located in the regions ranging from 100 to 300 kDa in extracts from young animals (Wang et al., 2001). In young livers, C/EBP forms complexes with cdks since cdk2 is detected in C/EBP precipitates (Figure 2C, up- per image), while no Brm is observed in C/EBP IPs. After the incubation of the nuclear extracts with Brm, C/EBP , Rb, and E2F4 are shifted to fractions containing high molecular weight complexes.
Immunoprecipitation of C/EBP and Western blot with antibodies to Rb re- vealed that this shift is due to the formation of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex (Figure 2C, bottom). Al- though in young livers C/EBP is associated with cdk2, cdk2 is not detected in C/EBP IPs after incubation of nuclear extracts with Brm. Given the fact that cdk2 and Brm interact with the same region of C/EBP (Wang et al., 2001, and see Figure 3B), we suggested that Brm might replace cdk2 from C/EBP. To examine this sug- gestion, we performed a direct test whether these pro- teins compete for the interaction with C/EBP. Full- length GST-C/EBP was incubated with nuclear extracts from young animals in the presence of increasing amounts of Brm. These studies revealed that Brm re- places cdk2 from C/EBP (Figure 2D). A similar result was obtained with a short C/EBP fragment (aa 140 207) to which both proteins bind (Figure 2D, right). Thus, these studies demonstrate that increased levels of Brm replace cdk2 from C/EBP and lead to the formation of the age-specific C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex (Fig- ure 2E). To better characterize the role of Brm in the formation of the age-specific complex, we investigated whether the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex functions in differ- entiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and whether Brm controls the formation of the complex in these cells.
We chose 3T3-L1 adipocytes because Porse et al. (2001) recently reported that C/EBP causes growth arrest in adipose tissues via repression of E2F transcription.
In 3T3-L1 cells, C/EBP is a key regulator of growth arrest and differentiation (Umek et al., 1991 Yeh et al., 1995). The differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was initiated as described (Timchenko et al., 1999b). Protein levels of C/EBP and Brm are increased in differentiated adipocytes, while levels of Rb are not altered (Figure 3A, Western blot). E2F4 levels are slightly induced at day 1 and returned to original levels in differentiated cells and E2F1 levels are not changed during differentiation (Figure 3A). The induction of Brm and C/EBP leads to the formation of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex since all these proteins are present in C/EBP IPs. To further character- ize the complex, proteins from differentiated adipocytes (day 6) were fractionated by gel filtration and the com- plex was analyzed as described above.
All components of the complex are colocalized in high MW fractions and form the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex since Brm is observed in C/EBP IPs from high MW fractions (Figure 3B). Thus, the analysis of protein-protein complexes of C/EBP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes shows that, similar to liv- ers of old animals, the induction of Brm leads to the formation of the complex.
Taken together, these investi- gations demonstrate that the induction of Brm is suffi- cient to cause the formation of the age-specific complex in vitro, in old livers and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during differentiation.
The Formation of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm Complex Requires Functional Rb and Two Regions of C/EBP Next, we determined the region(s) of C/EBP , which interact with the components of the complex.
GST pull- down assay was performed with constructs shown in Figure 3C. It has been previously demonstrated that a region of C/EBP between aa 50 and 95 interacts with Rb family proteins (Chen et al., 1996 Timchenko et al., 1999a Porse et al., 2001), and that another region of C/EBP , between aa 120 and 200, interacts with Brm (Pedersen et al., 2001). In agreement with these data,  Cell 498 Induction of Brm Levels in Old Livers Leads to the Appearance of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm Complex Figure 2.

Proteins levels of Brm are increased in old livers leading to the replacement of cdk2 from C/EBP and to the formation of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex.
GST-pull-down assay indicates that C/EBP -2 and 113 constructs, containing both these regions, interact with Brm, Rb, E2F1, and E2F4 proteins (Figure 3D). None of these proteins interacts with the short 50 amino acid N terminus of C/EBP. Deletion of Rb interacting region (construct DLF) or Brm interacting region (construct N142) results in the failure of C/EBP to interact with E2F1 or E2F4. However, the interaction of C/EBP with Rb and Brm is still observed with both deletion con- structs. These data are consistent with observations that Rb independently interacts with Brm (Dunaief et al., 1994 Strober et al., 1996), suggesting that the Rb or Brm interacting regions alone can pull down a Brm- Rb-C/EBP complex.
Thus, these studies demonstrated that the formation of the age-specific C/EBP -Rb-E2F4- Brm complex requires the interaction of C/EBP with both Rb and Brm proteins.
We next examined whether Rb is required for the formation of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex.
For this goal, we generated a stable clonal cell line with Rb- deficient SAOS2 cells (clone SA12, see Figure 6), in which C/EBP was cloned under Lac-repressor control.
Western analysis showed that Brm and E2F4 are ex- pressed at high levels in glucose-treated cells (control) and in IPTG-treated cells where C/EBP is induced (Fig- ure 3E). Co-IP studies demonstrate that although C/EBP interacts with Brm, E2F1, and E2F4 are not detectable in C/EBP IPs from cells that do not express Rb. These data are consistent with GST-pull-down re- sults showing that the deletion of Rb interacting region abolishes the interaction of C/EBP with E2F4 and E2F1. Taken together, these data show that two regions of C/EBP are required for the formation of the age-spe- cific C/EBP complex and that the formation of the com- plex also requires functional Rb (Figure 3F). C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm Complex Binds to E2F Consensuses In Vitro and Occupies E2F- Dependent Promoters in Livers of Old Animals We next examined whether the age-specific C/EBP complex interacts with DNA. Since the complex contains two transcription factors, C/EBP and E2F4 (Figure 3F), it might potentially bind to both E2F and C/EBP depen- dent promoters.
We first applied gel-shift assay to exam-  Aging Alters Pathways of C/EBP Growth Arrest 499 Figure 3.

ine whether the age-specific C/EBP complex interacts with DNA containing C/EBP or E2F consensuses.
Al- though the gel shift with E2F probes detects the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex, this complex is not stable under conditions of gel-shift assay and migrated very close to the top of the gel (data not shown). Therefore, we applied an HPLC-based approach to allow separa- tion of high MW complexes.
As a preliminary test, we examined whether DNA containing C/EBP or E2F con- sensus sequences increases the interaction of C/EBP with other components of the complex.
Short oligomers containing C/EBP (bZIP) and E2F consensuses for DHFR and Ad E2 promoters were incubated with sam- ples containing nuclear proteins from young liver and GST-C/EBP. The amounts of Rb in the complexes with C/EBP are 3- to 3.5-fold increased after incubation of proteins with wild-type E2F consensuses, but not with the bZIP oligomer (Figure 3F). These data indicate that the presence of a DNA containing E2F consensus in- creases the interaction of C/EBP with Rb and presum- ably the formation of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex.
To further examine if the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm com- plex interacts with the E2F consensus, nuclear extracts from young livers were incubated with wild-type or mu- tant E2F oligomers and proteins were fractionated by gel filtration.
The incubation of nuclear extracts with wild-type E2F consensus leads to a shift of all compo- nents of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex to higher  Cell 500 Figure 4.

MW fractions, while the incubation of the same extracts with the mutant E2F oligomer (which does not interact with E2F) does not affect the location of these proteins (Figure 4A). The shift of C/EBP and Rb to high MW fractions is due to the formation of the complex, since Rb is observed in C/EBP immunoprecipitates from these fractions (Figure 4A). These data indicate that the pres- ence of a DNA containing the E2F consensus is sufficient to promote the formation of the complex and that the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex interacts with E2F con- sensuses. We next examined whether the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4- Brm complex occupies E2F promoters in livers of old animals.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were utilized for these studies.
Three E2F-dependent promot- ers, DHFR, b-myb and cdc2, were initially examined.
As an additional control, we performed PCR reactions with primers specific to the hydroxysteroid sulfonyltransfer- ase (HSTS) promoter.
The HSTS promoter interacts in vivo with both E2F1 (through non-E2F specific site) and with C/EBP , but not with E2F4 or with other members of E2F family (Wells et al., 2002). In young animals, b-myb  Aging Alters Pathways of C/EBP Growth Arrest 501 and cdc2 promoters are occupied by E2Fs and Rb, while in old livers E2Fs, Rb and C/EBP are located on these promoters (Figure 4B). The difference in the binding of C/EBP to E2F promoters in young and old animals is specific for E2F dependent promoters, since the control HSTS promoter is bound only to E2F1 and C/EBP in both age groups.
It is interesting to note that although Brm is observed within the C/EBP complexes in nu- clear extracts of old animals, we could not detect in vivo association of Brm with any of the E2F-dependent promoters analyzed in this study, using several sources of antibodies to Brm. Another interesting observation is that, although young animals do not contain detectable levels of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complexes, C/EBP is lo- cated on the DHFR promoter, but not on two other E2F- dependent promoters, cdc2 and b-myb. We further showed that the association of C/EBP with DHFR pro- moter in young animals might be due to a direct interac- tion of C/EBP with the DHFR promoter (see below). In summary, chromatin precipitation analysis revealed that the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex is bound to E2F promot- ers in quiescent livers of old animals.
C/EBP Directly Interacts with E2F Consensus of the DHFR Promoter Given the occupation of the DHFR promoter by C/EBP in young livers, we next examined mechanisms respon- sible for localization of C/EBP on the DHFR promoter.
Nucleotide sequences of E2F consensuses within the DHFR and b-myb promoters are shown in Figure 4C. A putative C/EBP consensus (TCGCGAAAT) was found within E2F binding site of the DHFR promoter, but not within b-myb promoter.
We next established conditions of gel-shift assay under which E2F binding does not interfere with binding of C/EBP. It has been previously shown that poly dI-dC competitor specifically inhibits E2F binding (Jansen-Durr, 1994), but does not affect the interaction of C/EBP with DNA (Timchenko et al., 1996). Figure 4D shows a typical picture of the binding of E2F to the DHFR promoter in reactions containing salmon DNA or poly dI-dC competitors.
Both free E2F and E2F- Rb complexes are detectable in the reactions with salmon DNA. However, poly dI-dC completely blocks the interaction of E2F with DNA. Therefore, dI-dC com- petitor was further used in experiments to monitor only C/EBP binding activity in extracts containing both E2F and C/EBP transcription factors.
As a positive control for C/EBP binding, a bZIP probe containing high affinity C/EBP site (Timchenko et al., 1996) was used.
Figure 4E shows that C/EBP binds to the DHFR promoter, but not to b-myb promoter.
Incorporation of specific antibodies to C/EBP supershifted the complex and revealed that C/EBP interacts with the DHFR promoter.
This interaction seems to be direct, because bacterially expressed, purified to homogeneity his-C/EBP also binds to the DHFR promoter (Figure 4E, right). The muta- tions of TCGC region within E2F consensus of the DHFR promoter (M1, Figure 4C) abolish binding of both E2F and C/EBP (Figure 4F). Based on these data, we con- clude that C/EBP directly binds to E2F consensus within the DHFR promoter and that binding sites for E2F and C/EBP overlap within the DHFR promoter.
These data suggest that the presence of C/EBP on the DHFR promoter in young animals is mediated by the direct interaction of C/EBP with the DHFR promoter.
C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 Complex Represses Expression of c-myc after PH, which Leads to the Loss of Proliferative Response in Old Animals Given the occupation of E2F-dependent promoters by the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex in quiescent livers of old animals, we tested whether this complex represses E2F- dependent transcription after PH. Western analysis of C/EBP in livers of young and old animals showed that C/EBP is reduced after PH in livers of young animals, but C/EBP levels are not altered after PH in livers of old animals (Figures 5A and 5B). We next examined the expression of E2F targets in young and old livers.
We chose a short (6 hr for rat liver and 8 hr for mouse liver) time period after PH, since C/EBP levels are dramati- cally reduced in young livers at early time points and the effects of C/EBP reduction most likely to be direct within this time frame.
Western blotting showed that cdc2, b-myb, and DHFR proteins are not changed within 6 8 hr after PH in both age groups (Figures 5A and 5B for DHFR and cdc2, data not shown). On the contrary, c-myc protein is dramatically induced after PH in livers of young animals, while no induction of c-myc was ob- served in old animals.
These studies demonstrated that the induction of c-myc is blocked in old livers of both mice and rats.
We examined the interaction of C/EBP with the c-myc promoter and found that C/EBP does not bind directly to the c-myc promoter (data not shown). This suggests that effects on this promoter by C/EBP may occur through the interaction with Rb and E2F pro- teins. We next examined C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex in young and old livers after PH. Analysis of protein levels of Rb, E2F4, and Brm after PH is shown in Figures 5A and 5C. Protein levels of Rb, Brm, and E2F4 are not significantly changed in response to PH in both age groups.
At the same time, basal levels of Brm and C/EBP are very high in livers of old animals after PH. Coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that the C/EBP - Rb-E2F4-Brm complex is abundant in old livers after PH (Figure 5D). We also detected the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4- Brm complex by gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown). We next examined whether the failure of old mice to induce c-myc is due to the repression of the c-myc promoter by the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex.
The occupation of the c-myc promoter by E2F-Rb and C/EBP proteins was examined in quiescent livers and in livers after PH using chromatin-IP assay.
As can be seen in Figure 5E, E2F4-Rb complexes are present on the c-myc promoter in quiescent young livers.
In addi- tion to these proteins, C/EBP also occupies the c-myc promoter in quiescent old livers.
The induction of c-myc after PH in young mice correlates with the removal of Rb from the c-myc promoter, while in old livers the c-myc promoter is occupied by the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex.
These observations suggest that the age-spe- cific C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex represses transcription of c-myc and perhaps other E2F target genes such as cdc2 (Figure 5E). We also examined whether other signal transduction pathways differ in young and old animals after PH. Gel shift and Western analyses did not show differences in the activation of NF-kB, Stat3, Jun B, and C/EBP in young versus old mice (Figures 5A and 5B for Stat3 and NF-kB, data not shown). A working model for the regulation of the c-myc promoter in young and old livers after PH is shown in Figure 5F. Our data sug-  Cell 502 Figure 5.
C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 Complex Represses the c-myc Promoter after Partial Hepatectomy in Livers of Old Animals (A) A failure of old rat livers to reduce C/EBP after PH correlates with the lack of c-myc induction.
Proteins extracts from livers of young and old rats were isolated at different time points after PH (indicated on the top), and examined for the expression of C/EBP , c-myc, Jun B, Brm, Rb, and E2F4. Protein loading was verified by reprobing the membranes with  actin. (B) Old mouse livers also fail to reduce protein levels of C/EBP and do not induce c-myc in response to PH. Expression of the proteins (shown on the left) was examined in young and old mouse livers after partial hepatectomy by Western blotting.

(F) A hypothetical model for the regulation of the c-myc promoter after partial hepatectomy in young and old livers (see text). gest that the loss of c-myc induction in old livers is due the repression of this promoter by C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex.
In young animals, PH causes phosphorylation of Rb. Following removal of Rb from E2F promoters, activation of c-myc and other E2F target genes normally takes place.
In old animals, however, the C/EBP -Rb- E2F4 complex is present on the c-myc promoter and blocks its activation.
C/EBP Represses c-myc Promoter through C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 Complex Given the lack of induction of the c-myc in old animals and the presence of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex on c-myc promoter, we further examined the role of the complex in the repression of c-myc expression.
To ob- tain direct evidence that C/EBP represses the c-myc promoter through the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex, we performed an analysis of C/EBP -dependent repression of c-myc in two stable clonal lines: Rb-positive HT1 clone and Rb-negative SA12 clone.
In both cell lines, C/EBP is placed under Lac-repressor control and can be induced by IPTG. We have previously shown that IPTG-mediated induction of C/EBP in Rb-positive HT1 cells causes growth arrest (Timchenko et al., 1996). Fig- ure 6 shows the levels of C/EBP , and the E2F targets DHFR, c-myc, cdc2, and b-myb after IPTG addition.
C/EBP levels are increased at 2 24 hr after IPTG addi- tion with the maximum induction at 24 hr.
Calculations of DHFR, c-myc, cdc2, and b-myb proteins as ratios to  actin show that C/EBP inhibits expression of all E2F targets including c-myc. Chromatin immunoprecipita- tion assay shows that the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex occupies the c-myc promoter at 24 hr after C/EBP induction (Figure 6B). To examine whether the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex is required for the C/EBP -dependent repression of c-myc, we utilized the stable clonal line (SA12) derived  Aging Alters Pathways of C/EBP Growth Arrest 503 Figure 6.

from Rb-deficient SAOS2 cells.
Figure 6C shows that the addition of IPTG to SA12 cells leads to the induction of protein levels of C/EBP and to the induction of C/EBP binding activity (data not shown). We deter- mined E2F complexes, which are operating in SA12 cells, and found that only DP1/E2F1 and DP1/E2F4 are detectable, while Rb and other Rb family proteins do not form detectable complexes with E2F (Figure 6C, gel shift). We next analyzed expression of c-myc and cdc2 and the occupation of corresponding promoters by E2F and C/EBP complexes at very early times after C/EBP induction (when the effect is likely to be direct). Protein levels of c-myc and cdc2 are not reduced within 24 hr after C/EBP induction (Figure 6D) suggesting that, in Rb-deficient cells, C/EBP does not directly repress c-myc. This result is consistent with the failure of SA12 cells to form C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex (Figure 3). Chro- matin immunoprecipitation analysis of the c-myc pro- moter in SA12 cells expressing C/EBP (IPTG) or in control cells (glucose) shows that, in Rb-deficient cells, C/EBP is not bound to the c-myc promoter.
However, in Rb-positive HT1 cells, C/EBP is located on the c-myc promoter and represses c-myc expression (Figures 6A and 6B). Taken together, data in Rb-positive HT1 and in Rb-deficient SA12 clones, show that C/EBP represses c-myc through the formation of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex.
Discussion Aging Switches Pathways of C/EBP Growth Arrest in Liver In 1964, Bucher et al. discovered that livers of old ani- mals have a weak proliferative response to PH (Bucher et al., 1964). Although this phenomenon was described long ago, the molecular basis for the age-associated loss of proliferative capacities in the liver has not been elucidated.
We observed that the weak proliferative re- sponse in livers of old animals correlates with a failure to reduce the liver-specific transcription factor C/EBP that is a strong inhibitor of cell proliferation (Timchenko et al., 1998). The growth inhibitory activity of C/EBP was discovered in Dr. McKnight s laboratory more than ten years ago (Umek et al., 1991) and has been the  Cell 504 Figure 7.
Hypothetical Model for the Loss of Proliferative Response in Livers of Old Animals (see text) subject of intensive investigations.
The major result of these studies is that C/EBP possesses two major path- ways by which it inhibits cell proliferation: direct inhibi- tion of cdks (Wang et al., 2001) and repression of E2F transcription (Porse et al., 2001). These pathways are redundant in cultured cells and are tightly regulated in organisms.
A detailed analysis of C/EBP and inter- acting proteins in livers of young and old animals showed that, in old livers, C/EBP is observed in high MW complexes with Rb, E2F4, and Brm. The association of C/EBP with E2F and Rb family proteins shows that aging switches the C/EBP growth inhibitory pathway in liver from inhibiting cdks to E2F repression.
Our data suggest that this shift is mediated by the induction of Brm levels in old livers.
Since Brm and cdks interact with the same region of C/EBP (Wang et al., 2001 Pedersen et al., 2001), the increased levels of Brm in old livers replace cdks and, together with Rb and E2F4, recruit C/EBP to the E2F promoters.
Our working hy- pothesis for the failure of old livers to proliferate after PH is presented in Figure 7.
Liver proliferation after PH requires an orchestrated cascade of gene expression which includes timed elevation of cyclins D, A, and E. In young animals, cyclins E and A replace C/EBP from cdk2 and activate cdk2. cdk2 phosphorylates Rb and releases Rb-mediated repression of the c-myc pro- moter. In old animals, however, c-myc is repressed by the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex.
This complex is abun- dant after PH and blocks the induction of the c-myc in old livers.
A number of investigations demonstrated that the induction of c-myc plays a crucial role in liver prolifer- ation after PH (Fausto and Webber, 1994). Arora et al. (2000) recently demonstrated that inhibition of c-myc induction after PH in young livers causes a delayed and reduced proliferative response, the situation observed in livers of old animals.
Our data suggest that the repres- sion of the c-myc by C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex causes the reduced proliferative response in old animals (Figure 7). Old livers are not able to block the E2F pathway of C/EBP growth arrest, since the elimination of this pathway is not programmed by gene expression after PH. C/EBP Represses E2F Transcription as the Component of C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 Complex The formation of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex requires two regions of C/EBP : aa 70 95 (Rb inter- acting region) and aa 140 200 (Brm interacting region). Data from Rb-deficient cells show that Rb is required for the formation of the age-specific complex and for the repression of E2F transcription.
The role of Brm in the formation of the age-specific C/EBP complex is crucial, because the increase of Brm protein levels strongly correlates with the formation of the complex in two biological situations: in old livers and in differenti- ated adipocytes. Most importantly, the incubation of nuclear proteins from young animals with an excess of Brm leads to the appearance of the complex.
These observations demonstrate that Brm is required for the the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4-Brm complex.
appearance of However, the role of Brm in the C/EBP -mediated re- pression of E2F targets is not clear at this time.
Although Brm is observed in the complexes with C/EBP , we could not detect Brm on E2F-dependent promoters in vivo. One possible scenario is that Brm is required for the formation of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex, and then is removed from the complex after binding to E2F promot- ers. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the failure to immunoprecipitate Brm linked to E2F promot- ers is due to masking of the antibody epitopes after Brm binds to other proteins of the complex.
In support of our findings showing the inhibitory role of Brm in liver proliferation, Reyes et al. (1998) demonstrated that Brm  livers have an increased rate of liver proliferation.
Several previous publications revealed that C/EBP inhibits expression of c-myc in cultured cells at the tran- scriptional level (Freytag and Geddes, 1992 Timchenko et al., 1999a Johansen et al., 2001 Slomiany et al.,  Aging Alters Pathways of C/EBP Growth Arrest 505 2000). Our data provide the molecular mechanism of this C/EBP -mediated inhibition: via the repression of the c-myc promoter through the formation of C/EBP - Rb-E2F4 complex.
Experiments with two stable clonal lines, HT1 and SA12, revealed that C/EBP represses c-myc promoter in collaboration with Rb and E2F4. It is interesting to note that other E2F targets might be also regulated by C/EBP through a direct binding to the E2F consensuses.
In the course of these studies, we found that C/EBP binds to DHFR promoter in the ab- sence of the C/EBP -Rb-E2F4 complex (Figure 4B), and that this binding is mediated by a direct interaction with the E2F consensus within the DHFR promoter (Figures 4C 4E). This finding suggests that C/EBP might regu- late E2F promoters through more than one mechanism.
In summary, data in this paper show that aging changes pathways of C/EBP growth arrest in liver, and that this change leads to a loss in proliferative response to PH in old animals.
The understanding of the molecular basis for the reduced proliferative capacities of old livers is an important step in the development of therapeutic interventions to correct liver proliferation in older or- ganisms. Experimental Procedures Animals and Partial Hepatectomy Fischer 344 rats of 6 8 months (young) and 24 months (old) of age were used in these studies.
CB6F1 mice of 4 6 months (young) and 22 24 months (old) were used for the analysis of C/EBP complexes in quiescent livers and in livers after partial hepatectomy (PH). PH was performed as described in our earlier publications (Timchenko et al., 1998). 70% of the liver was surgically removed and regenera- tion was allowed to proceed for 4 and 8 hr.
Four young and four old animals at each time point after PH were examined.
Gel-Filtration Analysis of C/EBP Complexes Nuclear extracts were isolated from livers as described earlier (Tim- chenko et al., 1997) and fractionated by size-exclusion column SEC- 450 (HPLC, BioLogic HR, BioRad). The detailed procedure for the analysis of C/EBP complexes is described in our previous papers (Wang et al., 2001, 2002). Briefly, gel-filtration fractions were loaded on denaturing gradient (4% 20%) PAAG, blotted onto membrane, and probed with antibodies to C/EBP (14AA), Rb (C15 or F8), E2F4 (C20 or D3), E2F1, C/EBP (C19), Brg1 (from Santa Cruz), or to Brm (Transduction Laboratories). To detect C/EBP complexes, C/EBP was immunoprecipitated from each fraction, and IPs were probed with antibodies to Rb or Brm. Purification of Brm Protein Brm was purified from nuclear extracts of old livers using a combina- tion of HPLC-based, ion exchange, hydrophobic and size exclusion chromatography columns.
The purity and identity of Brm was exam- ined by Coomassie blue staining and by Western blotting with anti- bodies to Brm. Coomassie blue staining showed that the purified Brm represented a single band with MW 180 kDa that interacted with antibodies to Brm. All preparations were examined for the presence of Rb and E2F4. The purified Brm did not contain detect- able amounts of E2F4, Rb, or C/EBP. Protein Isolation and Western Blotting Nuclear extracts were isolated from cultured HT1 or SA12 cells as described in previous papers (Timchenko et al., 1996 Wang et al., 2001). Western Blotting with Proteins from Stable Clones HT1 and SA12 A stable C/EBP clone SA12 was generated with Rb-deficient SAOS2 cells as described (Timchenko et al., 1996). C/EBP was induced by IPTG and proteins were isolated at different time points after C/EBP induction.
Proteins (50 g) were loaded on gradient (4% 20%) PAAG, transferred on the membrane, and probed with antibodies to C/EBP and to E2F targets: c-myc (N262), b-myb, DHFR, and cdc2 (Santa Cruz). To verify protein loading, each filter was reprobed with  actin and then stained with Coomassie blue.
Western Blotting with Proteins from Quiescent Liver and after Partial Hepatectomy Nuclear extracts were isolated from mouse livers at 0, 4, and 8 hr after PH, loaded on the gradient (4% 20%) PAAG, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above.
Gel Shift Conditions for gel-shift assay and DHFR-E2F probe are described in our earlier paper (Timchenko et al., 1999a). Coimmunoprecipitation and GST Pull-Down C/EBP was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts with poly- clonal antibodies (14AA, Santa Cruz), and the presence of Rb, Brm, E2F4, cdk4, or cdk2 in C/EBP IPs was examined by Western blot- ting with monoclonal antibodies to mentioned proteins.
GST pull- down assay was performed as described in our papers (Wang et al., 2001, 2002). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed with cul- tured cells and with liver tissues as described in papers from Farn- ham s lab (Wells et al., 2000, 2002.). The chromatin solution was sonicated to obtain DNA fragments of 500 1000 bp length.
Antibod- ies against C/EBP (14AA), E2F1 (sc-193), E2F4 (sc-866), Rb (C15) (purchased from Santa Cruz), and Brm (Transduction Laboratories) were added to each aliquot of chromatin and incubated for over- night.
Blocked protein-A agarose (Sigma) was added and incubated for 30 40 min at room temperature.
After removing the crosslinking proteins, DNA was precipitated and used for PCR reaction with primers specific for E2F-dependent promoters.
We used primers to E2F-dependent promoters, which have been characterized in the Wells et al. paper (2000). The sequences of the primers are as follows: DHFR 1360, 5 -TCAGGACTCAGGCTGCTCGAGCCGC-3  DHFR 962, 5 -CGGCAATCCTAGGGTGAAGGCCTGGT-3  B-myb 446, 5 -CAGAGCCAGGG CCTCGCCTCATTG-3  B-myb  858, 5 - TCAGGACTCAGGCTGCTCGAGCCGC-3  Cdc2A-20, 5 -GGTAAAG CTCCCGGGATCCGCCAAT-3  Cdc2B-358, 5 -GTGGACT GTCAC TTTGGTGGCTGGC-3  C-mycA, 5 -CTTTATAATGCGAGGGTCTG GAGC-3  and C-mycB, 5 -GCTATGGGCAAAGTTTCGTGGATG-3. PCR mixtures were amplified for 1 cycle of 95 C for 5 min, annealing temperature for primers for 5 min, and 72 C for 2 min.
Then PCR mixtures were amplified for 34 cycles of 95 C for 1 min, annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 C for 1.5 min.
PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Three animals of each age group were examined by Chip assay.
At least three Chip assays were performed with each individual animal.
