Ecker2,3*  Functional analysis of a genome requires accurate gene structure information and a complete gene inventory.
A dual experimental strategy was used to verify and correct the initial genome sequence annotation of the reference plant Arabidopsis. Sequencing full-length cDNAs and hybridizations using RNA populations from various tissues to a set of high-density oligonucleotide arrays spanning the entire genome allowed the accurate annotation of thousands of gene structures.
We identiﬁed 5817 novel transcription units, including a substantial amount of anti- sense gene transcription, and 40 genes within the genetically deﬁned centromeres. This approach resulted in completion of 30% of the Arabidopsis ORFeome as a resource for global functional experimentation of the plant proteome. The genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a reference for plants (1). The initial identification of transcriptional units in the Ara- bidopsis genome sequence was carried out largely by ab initio gene predictions, sequence homology, sequence motif analysis, and other nonexperimental methods (2 7). This led to an estimate of 25,500 protein-coding genes (2). Though gene prediction software has steadily improved, the ability of these programs to pre- cisely determine gene structures in sequenced genomes remains unsatisfactory (8 10). A re- cent attempt to verify experimentally the accu- racy of the Arabidopsis genome annotation with approaches proved quite inefficient in identifying full- length (fl) open-reading frames (ORFs) (11). conventional molecular Global experimental approaches are expected to greatly improve genome annotation (12, 13). A genome sequence that is empirically an- notated can provide the foundation for the de- termination of its ORFeome, the complete set of ORF clones for all protein-coding genes.
Access to a gold standard cDNA/ORF clone collec- tion (14 16), representing the entire Arabidop- sis proteome, is urgently needed as a common resource for research (17). Here we report the experimental definition of the transcriptional units for all Arabidopsis genes by fl-cDNA dis- covery and by hybridization of RNA popula- tions to whole-genome arrays (WGAs) (fig. S1). Annotation and ﬂ cDNAs. Dramatic im- provements in genome annotation have been achieved for several organisms by means of sequences of fl-cDNAs (8, 15, 18, 19). For Arabidopsis, three collections of fl-cDNAs have been used for this purpose (8, 20 23). Of the 26,828 predicted genes in the Arabi- dopsis genome, 25,540 were annotated as protein-coding, with the rest being annotated as pseudo- and partial genes (fig. S3). A unique location in the genome can be identi- fied for the majority (99%) of cDNAs (fig. S4). From this analysis, three classes of genes were detected in the annotated ge- nome (fig. S5): (i) annotated expressed (AE) genes (ii) annotated non-expressed (ANE) genes, and (iii) newly discovered genes located in the intergenic regions (non-annotated expressed NAE). Seventy percent (18,093) of the 25,540 annotated genes were found to be transcriptionally ac- tive on the basis of identification of an ex- pressed sequence tag (EST) or cDNA, and these represent the class of the AE genes.
The remaining 7447 genes (30%) are the hypo- thetical, ANE (24) genes.
Only 10,507 (58%) of the AE genes have at least one fl-cDNA clone (Fig. 1). The remaining 7586 genes (42%) have evidence of their expression from At-ESTs and/or non fl-cDNAs (Fig. 1). Among the 10,507 genes with a fl-cDNA sequence, the annotated structures of 32% of them (3336) were inaccurately annotated.
In- corporation of fl-cDNA sequences resulted in the dramatic improvement of the genome annotation (fig. S6). The vast majority of predicted gene structures in the initial re- lease of the Arabidopsis genome annotation (August 2001 V1.0) were not derived from experimental evidence of transcription.

The density and distribution of the new unpredicted genes are shown in fig.S7 (22). The availability of a substantial number of Brassica, rice, and wheat ESTs allowed us to examine whether any of the aANE genes (Fig. 1) show similarity to these non-Arabidopsis ESTs. This analysis suggests that 45% of the ANE Arabidopsis genes are transcriptionally active [BLAST e-value  10 25, (22)] (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, alignment of the Brassica, rice, or wheat ESTs within the IGRs identified an additional 1042 transcription- ally active regions (BLAST e-value  10 25, Fig.1B). Overall, our analysis revealed that the Arabidopsis genome contains 28,000 genes of which 15,033 (59%) annotated genes lack a fl- cDNA clone and, therefore, have not been ex- perimentally verified.
Mapping transcriptional units using high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays.
In the absence of a corresponding fl-cDNA for 15,033 annotated genes (7586 AE and 7447 ANE genes) and for the 1350 newly discov- ered genes located in the IGRs (Fig. 1B), new methods are needed to obtain evidence for the existence of this remaining large number of un- touched genes.
Recently, microarray technolo- gy has been used for mapping transcription units in genomes (12, 13, 25). Despite the fact that the E. coli genome is well characterized, nearly 25% of the transcripts were previously unidentified (26). Except for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27, 28), however, tiling arrays have not been applied on a genome-wide scale for unbiased examina- tion of transcriptional activity in an eukaryote. To identify transcription units in the Arabi- dopsis genome, we used custom high-density oligonucleotide arrays that tile the entire genome and RNA samples prepared from a diverse set of tissues and treatments to ensure broad represen- tation of transcriptional activity.
Four pilot ar- rays, identical in design except for the regions of the genome sequence covered, were used to test the feasibility of the approach (fig. S8) (22). In brief, labeled cRNAs were prepared from differ- ent plant tissues and hybridized to the four ar- rays.
Figure 2A shows a deconvoluted and merged image of these arrays after hybridization with cRNA from three different plant tissues (flower, etiolated seedlings, and inflorescence). Differential gene expression was revealed across the 5 Mb region.
For example, gene At1g12110 (Fig. 2B) is expressed only in seedlings gene At1g10770 (Fig. 2C), only in flowers and gene At1g10630, in all three tissues (Fig. 2D). In addition, the hybridization profiles revealed the structures of the individual genes as confirmed by the sequences of fl-cDNAs corresponding to each of these genes (Fig. 2, B to D). Further analysis with mRNAs isolated from light grown (L ), dark grown (L ) and cold-stressed light grown (L cold) seedlings (22) representing different growth conditions revealed that 950 (88%) of the AE transcription units present on the four chips could be detected (Fig. 3A, AE). One-half of the ANE transcription units present on these four chips were also detected (Fig. 3A, ANE). Expression was detected for 61% percent of the newly discovered genes present on the four pilot chips (Fig. 3A, NAE). Validation of tiling chip detected transcrip- tion units was carried out through reverse tran- scriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification, cloning, and sequencing (fig. S9) (22). RT-PCR products were detected for 78% of the tested transcriptional units (table S1). Fifty- seven percent of the RT-PCR products yielded perfect ORF clones from both AE and ANE genes (table S1). The remaining 42% of the clones were without ORFs due to stop codons introduced during RT-PCR amplification (table S1). Whole-genome arrays.
We next de- signed a set of 12 oligonucleotide arrays representing 94% of the Arabidopsis ge- R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E nome sequence [110 Mb (22) (fig. S10)]. Each array contains 834,000 25-mer oli- gos (22). Four RNA populations (22) were hybridized to these arrays, and a transcrip- tion map for the entire Arabidopsis genome was determined (figs. S11 to S15) (22). Expression of 84% of the AE genes and 37% of the ANE genes was detected when these four RNA samples were used (Fig. 3B, AE and ANE). In addition, we were also able to detect a large number ( 54%) of transcriptionally active sites correspond- ing to the chromosomal locations where the newly discovered genes were found (Fig. 3B, NAE). Transcriptional activity was also detected in 2000 intergenic regions (23%) that were thought to be devoid of transcriptional activity (Fig. 3B, IGR). five The chromosomes were equally transcriptionally active under various growth conditions or developmental stages (fig. S16). include: Fig.1.

The transcrip- tional activity across each chromosome was dif- ferent in various tissues tested (Fig. 4). For ex- ample, the right arm of chromosome 2 showed more transcriptionally active sites in suspension cell cultures [Fig. 4, compare (E) with (C) in chr. 2] than in flowers.
In addition, in certain cases the transcriptional activity was strand-specific.
For example, in roots there was more transcrip- tion from the forward-strand than from the re- verse complement strand (Fig. 4D, chr. 1). The gene density is approximately the same in both strands.
The distribution of tissue-specific tran- scripts across the five chromosomes is shown in Fig.5.
Functional classification of the tissue- specific transcripts revealed variation in the types of genes expressed in a tissue-specific manner (fig. S17). For example, 16% of the flower-specific AE transcription units encode proteins involved in metabolism, whereas only 6.5% of the same class of genes were detected in suspension cell cultures (fig. S17C, compare flower with suspension cell culture). More detailed analyses of the whole-genome transcription map focused on examination of regions of the genome, such as pseudogenes and centromeres, thought to be relatively transcrip- tionally silent and also on genomic locations showing antisense RNA expression.
(Fig. 6A). We detected transcription for 20% of the 1332 ANE pseudogenes (Fig. 6A), suggesting that these ORFs may be misannotated. Alternatively, as recently described for mouse (29), such ac- tively transcribed pseudogenes may function to regulate gene activity.
In total, 7600 anno- tated genes ( 30% of all annotated genes) were identified that showed significant antisense RNA expression (Fig. 6B), suggesting that double- strand RNA formation may be a general phe- nomenon in plant cells (30). We found comple- mentary patterns of tissue-specific expression of sense and antisense RNAs for many genes, in- dicating a possible biological role for these tran- scripts (31). Lastly, we surveyed regions located within the genetically defined centromeres for transcriptional activity [(2, 32) Fig.6C]. Tran- scriptional activity was confirmed for 90% of the AE genes.
Transcriptional activity was also observed for 45% of the unexpressed genes, and we identified 29 new transcribed genes with- in the five centromere regions.
Surprisingly, two unusually highly expressed sites, hot spots, were identified within the genetically defined centromeres of two chromosomes (2, 22, 32) (Fig. 6D). The centromere region of chromo- some 2 (CEN2) contains a large ( 600 kb) insertion of a rearranged copy of the mitochon- drial genome (2). This entire genomic location showed high level of transcriptional activity.
In addition, several unannotated regions within the centromere region of chromosome 3 (CEN3) were identified that displayed a significantly higher level of transcriptional activity from both forward and reverse complement DNA strands (Fig. 6D). These highly transcribed sequences within CEN3 were largely composed of transpo- son or retrotransposon-like sequences but also contained some unique sequences.
Overall, evidence from both cDNA sequencing and WGA expression studies al- lowed detection of transcriptional activity for 5817 previously ANE (hypothetical) genes (Fig. 3B, ANE figs.

Large-scale ORFeome projects not only aid in the improvement of whole ge- nome annotation, but also provide valuable re- sources functional genomic studies and proteomics (33, 34). We constructed 8750 error-free ORF clones [Table 1 (22, 35)] representing approximately 32% of the annotated genes.
Functional classification of the constructed ORFeome revealed a similar distribution of the various functional classes compared with the complete set of annotated genes (fig. S19).

844 31 OCTOBER 2003 VOL 302 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org  lection projects (8, 15, 18), the traditional ap- proach of sequencing fl-cDNAs reaches a point of diminishing returns: two-thirds of the total anno- tated Arabidopsis genes still have no correspond- ing fl-cDNA. The WGA technology allowed us to identify transcripts for the ANE genes and en- abled construction of the remaining 30% of the Arabidopsis ORFeome. We were able to detect 60% of the total annotated genes (AE and ANE) using only a limited number of RNA sam- ples (four). A more comprehensive survey of tis- sues and cell types should enable a more complete description of the transcriptome. WGAs serve as a molecular roadmap for detecting transcription units and their structures across the chromosomes.
This capability arrives at a convenient time, because several major ef- forts to generate fl-cDNAs for identification of a full set of ORF clones of expressed genes are under way [the Mammalian Gene Collection (15, 16) and FANTOM (36)]. As these collec- tions become more complete, the marginal utility of each added EST decreases, and the prospect Table 1.

Use of full-genome tiling arrays is a natural way to complete the identification of transcription units.
In addition, the data presented here raise the prospect that novel, tissue-specific transcription units can be identified in Arabidopsis by means of WGAs, cloned, and functionally studied with biochemical and reverse genetic approaches (37). The WGAs allowed us to detect transcrip- tion from many of the pseudogenes, providing additional evidence that this class of genes may function in the regulation of their paralogous counterparts (29). Our studies also revealed that a large fraction of Arabidopsis genes showed expres- sion of an antisense RNA transcript that, in many cases, was tissue-specific.
These results suggest that the production of double-stranded RNAs may play a greater role in the regulation of normal plant development than is currently understood.
The use of genome tiling array technology is not restricted to transcription unit mapping of RNA polymerase II transcripts.
WGAs can also be used for detecting mitochondrial- or plastid- derived RNAs and potentially could be used for the identification of a variety of small noncoding RNAs (nc-RNAs) (38). By design, WGAs con- tain DNA sequences absent from traditional gene expression arrays, such as the promoters, introns, and intergenic dark matter.
Thus, they are well suited for global mapping of DNA binding sites by location analysis (39, 40) and provide an unbiased view of DNA binding sites that recent studies suggest may lie within coding regions at a greater frequency than pre- viously suspected (41). Genome tiling arrays can Utility of WGAs for genomic analysis.
We used a strategy for mapping transcription units that included both a traditional cDNA cloning and DNA sequencing approach and a novel high- throughput approach that utilizes tiling array tech- nology (12, 13, 25). Sequencing ESTs and fl-cDNAs verified 40% of the annotated genes, dramatically improved genome annotation, and allowed the construction of 30% of the ORFeome.

Finally, WGAs might also be used for direct mapping of point mutations without the use of segregated populations.
The impact of these findings and of the ex- perimental resources developed is not restricted to Arabidopsis. For example, 85% of Arabidopsis genes have close homologs in the rice genome (43). Therefore, this resource will aid in the elu- cidation of the function(s) of the vast majority of genes in plant genomes (43, 44), providing fun- damental knowledge that we hope will eventually lead to the engineering of new plant species.

Com- parison with image simulations showed that the grain boundary contains oxygen vacancies.
Measurements of atom displacements near the grain boundary revealed close correspondence with theoretical calculations.
Direct imaging of atoms in oxides, especially in defect regions, is of considerable impor- tance for understanding the properties of ma- terials. Because oxygen has a high electro- negativity, its presence can have a marked effect on these properties.
This can occur through the binding of free electrons, which leads to a loss of electrical conductivity (e.g., in metal oxides) through the presence of va- cancies in the oxygen sublattice, which in turn can give rise to considerable ionic con- ductivity (as in electroceramic materials). Oxygen has a strong effect on mechanical properties, which are directly linked with the strong interatomic forces.
But oxygen can also have an indirect influence: Most proper- ties of materials are sensitively influenced by the presence of crystal defects, and the oxy- gen concentration at such defects can drasti- cally deviate from the average bulk value, even in thermal equilibrium.
This is one of the reasons why grain boundaries (GBs) in electroceramics can be electrically charged and form a double Schottky barrier against the movement of ions (1, 2), which is of ultimate importance in polycrystalline elec- troceramic materials.
Recently, it was shown that dislocations in SrTiO3 can be oxygen deficient (3) and that this can lead to a change Max-Planck-Institut fu r Metallforschung, Heisenbergstra e 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
