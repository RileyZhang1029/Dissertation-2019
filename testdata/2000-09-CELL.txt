In these mice, the size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to 2-fold, at least in part due to an increase in the lifespan of dou- ble-positive (DP) thymocytes. More importantly, there was an increase in the number of T cells in the second- ary lymphoid organs that had acquired an antigen- dependent memory phenotype.
These T cells were bonafide memory cells as assessed by a variety of criteria.
In addition, T cells from wild-type mice ac- quired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several rounds of antigen-stimulated division.
We propose that CaMKII controls a distinct process of activation- induced cellular differentiation.
Introduction The multifunctional calcium/calmodulin kinase II family consists of at least four different isoforms that mediate part of the cellular response to calcium in various tissues (Hanson and Schulman, 1992). The a and b isoforms of CaMKII are exclusively expressed in the brain, whereas the g and d isoforms of CaMKII are ubiquitously ex- pressed (Tobimatsu and Fujisawa, 1989). In the brain, CaMKII function is intricately linked to the induction of LTP (Lisman and Goldring, 1988 Malinow et al., 1989 Deisseroth et al., 1995 Fukunaga et al., 1996) and spatial learning as shown by the analysis of mice that express a calcium-independent form of CaMKIIa or mice that are deficient in CaMKIIa (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b Sod- erling, 1993 Mayford et al., 1995, 1996 Giese et al., 1998). There is only a limited understanding of CaMKII function in other tissues (Nishimoto et al., 1991 Heist and Schulman, 1998). CaMKII can reveal kinase activity in two ways.
Upon calcium influx, calcium-calmodulin binds to CaMKII and  To whom correspondence should be addressed (e-mail: shedrick@ ucsd.edu). These authors contributed equally to this work.

Activated CaMKII phosphorylates various substrates including threonine 287 (for g, T286 for a) in the CaMKII inhibitory domain (Miller and Kennedy, 1986 Braun and Schulman, 1995). Autophosphorylation of Thr-287 causes CaMKII sub- units to acquire a high affinity for calmodulin in the ab- sence of calcium, such that calmodulin can remain trapped on autophosphorylated CaMKII this results in autonomous, or calcium-independent, CaMKII activity (Meyer et al., 1992). CaMKII exists as a holoenzyme composed of 6 12 subunits, and the proportion of autophosphorylated subunits is determined by the frequency of calcium os- cillations produced by influx through calcium-selective channels such as the postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspar- tate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (Bennett et al., 1983 Kanaseki et al., 1991 Hanson and Schulman, 1992 De Koninck and Schulman, 1998). CaMKII can thus store the previous frequency of calcium oscillations in the form of phosphothreonines such that CaMKII is a biochemical decoder that contributes to at least one aspect of the frequency response function leading to LTP in hippocampal neurons.
Conceptually, calcium- dependent activity reflects acute activation, whereas the level of autonomous CaMKII activity reflects the pre- vious frequency of calcium oscillations.
In T cells, calcium is an important second messenger that contributes to the induction of proliferation, anergy, and cell death (Schwartz, 1996 Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996 Alberola-Ila et al., 1997 McConkey and Or- renius, 1997 Berridge et al., 1998). It thus affects acute T cell activation and also long-term changes in antigen responsiveness.
As a major downstream effector of cal- cium-calmodulin in T cells, CaMKII has the biochemical design to regulate activation, anergy, and memory.
To determine the effect of CaMKIIg on T cells, Nghiem et al. (1993) constructed a calcium-independent mutant of CaMKIIg-B analogous to the CaMKIIa mutant used to study neuronal LTP. This mutant (CaMKIIgB) encodes a negatively charged aspartic acid substituted for the threonine 287 phosphorylation site and exhibited 37% In Jurkat T cells, CaMKIIg-B* autonomous activity.
squelched IL-2 production (Nghiem et al., 1994), and this was interpreted as an indication that CaMKII may be a mediator of T cell anergy. In order to understand how CaMKII regulates T cell physiology, and in particular the long-term generation of anergy or memory, we generated mice expressing the calcium-independent mutant of CaMKIIgB (CaMKIIgB*) in the T cell lineage.
Furthermore, we developed an assay to specifically measure CaMKII activity in T cells.
Herein, we report a previously unrecognized role for CaMKII in influencing immature T cell lifespan and T cell memory formation.
Results Transgene Construction A form of CaMKII found in human T cells is the B subtype of the gamma isoform, CaMKIIgB (Nghiem et al., 1993). Cell 458 Figure 1.

(B) Two expression cassettes were used to generate a total of six founders with variable expression.
The CD4 silencer element is in- cluded in the human CD2-based expression cassette, though in this context it does not function (K. H. M., unpublished data). (C) Western blot showing thymic expression of the transgene com- pared to endogenous CaMKII. As a control, Jurkat human T cell lym- phoma cells expressing SV40 large T were transfected with the trans- gene.
The transgene in founder 32 was made homozygous (1/1) to increase expression.
The partially calcium-independent mutant form of the human CaMKIIgB cDNA (CaMKIIgB*) was subcloned into two expression cassettes, and six founders were obtained (Figures 1A and 1B). Transgenic line 32 bred for transgene homozygosity expressed roughly 3-fold the level of endogenous protein (Figure 1C). In this line, a combination of RT-PCR and Western analysis indicated transgene expression in all of the T lineages: CD4CD8 double-negative (DN), CD4CD8 double-positive (DP), and mature CD4 single-positive (CD4SP) and CD8SP T cells (data not shown). Much of the phenotypic analysis came from CaMKIIgB*-32, since it was the first one ob- tained. Line CaMKIIgB*-50 expressed the transgene at about ten times the level of the endogenous message (Figure 1C), and preliminary analysis of this line fully cor- roborated the major observations made with CaMKIIgB*-32 mice.
For brevity, we will use CaMKIIgB* to refer to CaMKIIgB*-321/1 mice.
Thymic Phenotype The most obvious effect of CaMKIIgB* on thymic popula- tions was a decrease in the proportion of SPs and an increase in the percentage of DPs (Figure 2A). A similar change in percentages was also seen in CaMKIIgB*-50 mice (Figure 2, legend). The accummulated data from a large number of mice showed that the thymi from CaMKIIgB* mice were about 1.5 to 2 times the size of control mice, and this increase was mostly in the progen- itor DP population (Figure 2B). There was a slight de- crease in CD4SPs but not in CD8SPs (data not shown). These differences in cell numbers remained consistent with age (3.5 weeks to 7.5 months), such that age-related thymic atrophy was normal in CaMKIIgB* mice (data not shown). We tested the possibility that this phenotype could be explained by cell division however, cell cycle analysis using 7-AAD (DNA content) and the incorpora- tion of BrdU (DNA synthesis) showed that there was no difference in intrathymic proliferation (data not shown). We thus considered the alternative possibility that the CaMKIIgB* gene affected cell survival.
The majority of DPs are not selected for further devel- opment, and kinetic labeling experiments showed that they undergo programmed cell death after a fixed life- span of approximately 3.5 days (Huesmann et al., 1991 Shortman et al., 1991). We similarly measured the DP lifespan by the continuous administration of BrdU in vivo followed by an analysis of the incorporation of label into the nondividing DP population (Figure 2C). Whereas DPs from wild-type mice had a 3 3.5 day lifespan, DPs from CaMKIIgB* mice showed a longer lifespan esti- mated to be 4 4.5 days.
Consistent with an enhanced survival in the thymus, the DPs but not the SPs exhibited an enhanced survival in culture as measured by the number of surviving, annexin V-negative cells (Figure 2D). In order to determine whether endogenous CaMKII activity regulates DP survival, we tested the effects of CaMKII inhibitors on thymocyte survival in organ culture.
In separate experiments, we used KN62 and also the combination of KN93 and its inactive ortholog, KN92 (Tokumitsu et al., 1990 Sumi et al., 1991). The experi- ments consistently showed that the addition of CaMKII inhibitor caused a reduction in cell recovery in the DP population (Figure 2E). The recovery of SPs was also reduced and that could be due to decreased number of surviving DP precursors or a decrease in the survival of SPs themselves.
The opposing effects of the trans- gene and the CaMKII inhibitors reveal that CaMKII regu- lates the survival and thus the lifespan of DP thymo- cytes. The Phenotype of T Cells in the Peripheral Lymphoid Organs of CaMKIIgB* Mice The size of the spleen was increased in the CaMKIIgB* mice, yet FACS analysis indicated no increase in the numbers of CD4 or CD8 splenocytes (Figure 3A). Prelimi- nary experiments showed an increase in B cells in the spleen, and we do find expression of the transgene in B cells by RT-PCR. Analysis of the role of CaMKIIg in B cells is ongoing.
Antigen activation causes CD4 T cells to increase the expression of CD44, decrease L-selectin (CD62L), and decrease CD45RB (Dutton et al., 1998). This phenotype remains even after the cells revert to quiescence, and it is thus used to characterize prior antigenic experience  CaMKII Influences T Cell Memory Formation 459 Figure 2.

or memory T cells.
Functionally, memory cells have been shown to produce a more rapid and varied cytokine response, and thus a secondary cellular immune re- sponse arises from an enhanced response by individual cells as well as an expansion of the antigen-reactive T cell clade. Previous work has shown that the proportion of T cells exhibiting a memory/activation phenotype in- creases with age, presumably due to immune responses to environmental antigens (Ernst et al., 1993 Sprent et al., 1997). In CaMKIIgB* mice, we found a substantial increase in the percentage and number of T cells exhib- iting a memory phenotype (Figures 3B and 3C). This enlarged population was found starting at 3 weeks of age and maintained such that CaMKIIgB* mice consis- tently exhibited a 1.3- to 2-fold increase in the number of memory-phenotype cells.
It was found in CD4 and CD8 subpopulations, in both the spleen and LN, and it was further exaggerated in CaMKIIgB*-50 mice.
Conversion to the Memory Phenotype Is Antigen Specific The physiological development of memory cells is, of course, antigen dependent, and this is supported by the observation that mice housed in germ-free facilities do not develop CD45lo T cells (Lee et al., 1990). Furthermore, in mice transgenic for T cell antigen receptor genes, T Figure 3.

T Cells with a Memory Phenotype in CaMKIIg-B* Mice Are Functional (A) The increase in CD44hi cells is antigen dependent.
Spleen cells from AND and AND CaMKIIg-B* mice were analyzed for the expres- sion of CD44 versus CD3 or transgenic Va11. (B) Memory-phenotype cells from CaMKIIg-B* mice secrete cyto- kines indicative of a memory response.
Lymph node cells from CaMKIIg-B* and control mice were enriched for T memory cells (see the Experimental Procedures). IgG-depleted LN was used as a source of naive cells.
After enrichment, cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml PMA and 0.5 mM ionomycin for 14 hr.
cells expressing the transgenes do not convert to mem- ory cells in the absence of antigen (Linton et al., 1996 Tanchot et al., 1997). AND transgenic mice possess TCRa and b chain transgenes that endow T cells with specificity for a peptide from pigeon cytochrome c bound to H-2Ek (Kaye et al., 1989). In order to examine the antigen dependence of memory cell formation in CaMKIIgB* mice, we crossed CaMKIIgB* with AND TCR transgenic mice to obtain mice that were genotypically AND1/2 CaMKIIgB*1/1 H-2b. They are unlikely to be ex- posed to pigeon cytochrome c in our mouse colony, and in any event, this peptide is not presented by H-2Ab, the only MHC class II molecule expressed by these mice.
Similar to CaMKIIgB* mice, the AND1/2 CaMKIIgB*1/1 H-2b mice had twice the percentage of CD44hi cells when compared with AND1/2 H-2b mice (Figure 4A). The criti- cal issue is whether the CaMKIIgB* transgene is suffi- cient to convert cytochrome c-specific T cells to a mem- ory phenotype or whether T cells that express the cytochrome c-specific TCR remain naive.
Notably, al- though they expressed normal levels of the TCR-CD3 complex (Figure 4A, bottom left), the cells that ex- pressed high levels of CD44 selectively did not express the transgenic a chain, Va11 (Figure 4A, bottom right). This was also found for CaMKIIgB*-50 mice.
These data strongly suggest that enhanced conversion to a memory phenotype under the influence of the CaMKIIgB* trans- gene requires the expression of an endogenous TCR, and we deduce that this event is thus antigen de- pendent.
Memory Cells Produce IL-4 and IFNg One hallmark of a memory cell population is the ability to secrete a wider diversity of cytokines (Picker et al., 1995 Dutton et al., 1998). We compared populations enriched for memory or naive cells from CaMKIIgB* and control mice for their ability to synthesize IL-2, IL-4, and IFNg. As depicted in Figure 4B, the naive cells produced IL-2 almost exclusively, whereas a larger proportion of memory produced IL-4 and IFNg. Notably, there was no significant difference between cells from CaMKIIgB* mice and wild-type mice in the ability to secrete cyto- kines.
The CD8 memory-phenotype cells in CaMKIIgB* and control mice exhibited a similar trend of cytokine secretion (data not shown). We deduce from these data that the memory-phenotype cells from CaMKIIgB* mice have the functional capacity to secrete cytokines in an identical manner to memory cells from wild-type mice.
CaMKIIgB* Mice Exhibit Enhanced Immune Responses In order to understand the basis of the enhanced num- bers of memory cells, we performed four types of experi- ments that measure the capacity of T cells to proliferate and survive both in vitro and in vivo. The first experiment measured the proliferative response of lymph node T cells from AND and AND CaMKIIgB* mice elicited by pigeon cytochrome c peptide.
This is a response of naive cells since we showed that memory phenotype cells do not retain high levels of the cytochrome c-spe- cific TCR (Figure 4A). As shown, there was no difference in the dose response curves, but the population of T cells from AND CaMKIIgB* mice synthesized DNA at a higher rate (Figure 5A). Identical results were obtained using CaMKIIgB*-50 mice (data not shown). In a second type of experiment, we inoculated mice with 10 mg of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), which activates T cells expressing Vb8.1 and Vb8.2, but not Vb6 (White et al., 1989). The expansion and decline of these T cell populations was followed in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (Figure 5B). Initially, the number of Vb8 T cells subsided, probably due to the fact that they are sequestered in the lymphatic system (Vasseur et al., 1999). This loss of Vb8 T cells preceded a superantigen- mediated expansion followed by a decline shown to be accompanied by apoptosis (Kawabe and Ochi, 1991 MacDonald et al., 1991 Webb et al., 1994). This was found with identical kinetics for CaMKII and wild-type littermate mice, with the exception that we consistently found an increase in the magnitude of the expansion in vivo (Figure 5B) (see the Discussion). In the same experiments, nonresponding Vb6 T cells were monitored and found to undergo no appreciable changes (data not shown). We next tested the ability of the CaMKIIgB* mice to respond to antigen after a previous immunization.

Enhanced Immune Responses in CaMKIIg-B* Mice (A) Enhanced response to PCC T cell from CaMKIIg-B* mice.
Lymph node cells from AND CaMKIIg-B* and AND mice were cul- tured for 3 days and pulsed with 1 mCi of 3H-thymidine for the last 20 hr.
(B) Vb81 T cell expansion and deletion in vivo was induced by SEB. CaMKIIg-B*-50 and wild-type littermates (both H-2bxd) were inocu- lated with 10 mg of SEB i.v., and, at the times indicated, mice were bled.
The number of Vb81 and Vb61 in blood, counted as a per- centage of the total CD41 T cells, was deter- mined.
Data are mean and standard deviation of values from five mice for each group.
(C) CaMKIIg-B* and control mice were immu- nized with 100 mg of KLH-DNP and complete Freunds adjuvant in the hind footpad. At the indicated times postimmunization, draining LNs were harvested and stimulated in vitro with KLH and syngeneic APCs for 3 days.
functional CD4 memory response was assayed by im- munization with KLH-DNP in complete Freund s adju- vant followed by restimulation in culture (Figure 5C). The results showed that the CaMKIIgB* mice had an enhanced in vitro recall response to KLH. As seen in the previous experiment, the dose response curves were unchanged in that the cells responded to the same range of antigen concentrations.
In order to determine the mechanism by which CaMKII enhances proliferation, we analyzed the kinetics of pro- gression through the cell cycle and the proportion of cells that undergo apoptosis.
Lymph node cells from AND and AND CaMKIIgB* mice (H-2b) were stimulated in culture with antigen-presenting cells (H-2bxk) and PCC for 1 3 days.
The cells were labeled with the fluorescent dye, CFSE, at the initiation of culture, and the number of cell divisions was followed by the dilution of fluores- cence. Cells were gated for CD4 and Va11 and the popu- lations analyzed for the number of cell divisions (Figure 6). Starting at day 2, the population of T cells (CD4 Va111) from AND CaMKIIgB* mice included cells that had undergone at least one extra division relative to cells from AND controls.
For example, at day 3, AND T cells stimulated with 1 mM PCC included a significant number of cells that had undergone 0, 1, 2, or 3 rounds of division, with a barely detectable population that had undergone 4 rounds of division.
In contrast, T cells from AND CaMKIIgB* mice included cells that had gone through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 rounds of division.
This result suggests that CaMKII autonomous activity can either shorten the cell cycle or increase cell survival.
In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the number of cells undergoing apoptosis by simultane- ously labeling with 7AAD (Philpott et al., 1996) (Figure 6). The proportion of apoptotic cells is plotted as a func- tion of the cell divisions for each condition.
The results show that, especially by day 3, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of apoptotic cells in the cul- tures from AND CaMKIIgB* mice.
This is consistent with a mechanism of action whereby the autonomous form of CaMKIIgB* provides a survival signal that allows cells to choose a memory fate as opposed to activation- induced cell death.
Although this explanation accounts for at least some of the activity of CaMKIIgB*, we cannot yet exclude the possiblity that there is also an effect on the progression of the cell cycle.
CaM Kinase II Activity in Activated, Dividing T Cells To specifically measure endogenous CaMKIIg activity, we immunoprecipitated (IP) CaMKIIg before performing the kinase reaction.
We found an increase in activity from thymocytes isolated from CaMKIIgB* versus con- trol mice, as well as in CaMKIIg-B*-transfected versus control Jurkat cells (Figure 7A). This increase was seen in both autonomous and calcium-dependent activity, confirming the specificity of the assay.
Furthermore, this result provided evidence that the CaMKIIgB* transgene encoded the expected biochemical activity.
In normal unstimulated thymocytes, we could not detect autono- mous activity above background, whereas thymocytes from CaMKIIgB* mice showed 10% 20% autonomous activity.
The calcium-dependent activity in CaMKIIgB* mice was 2- to 3-fold higher than in wild-type mice,  Cell 462 Figure 6.
T Cells from CaMKII Mice Undergo More Rounds of Division and Less Activation- Induced Cell Death Lymph node cells from AND CaMKIIg-B*-50 and AND littermates were labeled with CFSE and stimulated in vitro with 0, 1, or 10 mM of moth cytochrome c peptide 88 103 (MCC). Each day, CD41Va111 cells were gated for CFSE fluorescence and for the percentage of cells that stained with 7AAD. consistent with the level of overexpressed protein as detected by Western blots.
The phenotypic results suggest that CaMKIIg contrib- utes to the formation of a memory T cell response.
This could come about in one of two ways: CaMKII may regulate the formation of memory cells versus activa- tion-induced apoptosis alternatively, CaMKII could pro- vide an epigenetic mechanism for maintaining T cell memory.
To begin to distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured CaMKII activity in wild-type memory versus naive cells.
We used two methods to enrich for memory and naive cells in order to avoid potential artifacts introduced by antibody-mediated cel- lular manipulations.
We also added another control for specificity by carrying out the reactions in the presence and absence of a CaMKII peptide inhibitor (CKI) (Smith et al., 1992). Since the level of autonomous activity was low, we used 1/10 the amount of lysate for the calcium- dependent versus the autonomous reaction.
The results revealed no significant difference in the calcium-depen- dent or autonomous activity in naive versus memory populations (Figure 7B). Since we could not detect increased CaMKII activity in memory versus naive cells, we reasoned that CaMKII activity must be important for the induction rather than maintenance of T cell memory.
We tested the hypothesis that CaMKII activity increases upon activation and cell division by stimulating purified AND TCR transgenic cells in vitro with pigeon cytochrome c peptide and antigen-presenting cells from B10.A mice.
Cells were cultured in the presence of antigen and antigen-present- ing cells and supplemented with 20 U/ml rIL-2 after 48 hr.
Cell lysates were generated from cells stimulated for different lengths of time and assayed for CaMKII activity compared to unstimulated cells.
Cells were also labeled with CFSE at time 0 and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the distribution of cell divisions (Figure 7C). The level of autonomous (calcium-independent) CaMKII activity increased at days 4 and 5 but not at day 2, suggesting that autonomous CaMKII activity increases not simply in response to activation signals but in con- cert with antigen- and IL-2-mediated cell division (Figure 7D). The magnitude of the increase by densitometry was approximately 1.4-fold over the background at time zero.

Discussion Memory T Cells There is no reason a priori that memory in the nervous system shares more than an etymological similarity to memory in the immune system.
We were thus somewhat surprised to find that a major biochemical decoder of previous activation in the nervous system may play an analogous role in lymphocytes.
Yet, CaMKII is ubiqui- tously expressed, and its tailored biochemical charac- teristics were presumably selected to function in a vari- ety of cell types.
Genetic and biochemical processes are often used and coopted during evolution, so, in retro- spect, the notion that there are distant parallels between the memory of experience and the memory of antigen experience may have a basis in fact.
In this report, we document that a point mutation in CaMKIIgB causes two readily apparent effects on the physiology of the immune system.
Most notably, CaMKIIgB* enhances the antigen-dependent formation of T cell memory.
This re- verse genetics approach was reinforced by the observa- tion that the activation and induction of cell division in primary cultures of T cells causes an increase in endoge- nous CaMKIIg activity.
A second observation, that may or may not be related, is that CaMKIIgB* lengthened the DP thymocyte lifespan.
We deduce that the memory phenotype of cells from CaMKIIgB* mice, as defined by the expression of CD44, CD62L, and CD45RB cell surface markers, is indicative of memory T cells able to mediate a secondary immune response.
First, the conversion to the memory-pheno- type increased with age, similar to that which is seen in wild-type mice.
Second, the increase in memory-pheno- type cells was specific for cells with the potential to recognize environmental antigens, i.e., cells with a trans- genic TCR that expressed CaMKIIg-B* remained naive.
Third, memory-phenotype cells from CaMKIIgB* mice expressed an expanded range of cytokines after stimu- lation that was indistinguishable from wild-type memory cells (Cho et al., 1999). Fourth, T cells from CaMKIIgB* mice exhibit an enhanced recall response to antigen.
One issue concerns the long-term survival of peripheral blood T cells stimulated by SEB. Based on the steady- state increases in memory cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, we might have expected the Vb8 T cells to per- sist at higher levels in CaMKIIgB* mice.
That fact that SEB causes an initial increase, but no enhanced persis- tence, is probably related to the observation that super- antigen activation leads not to memory but rather to clonal exhaustion and unresponsiveness (Rammensee et al., 1989 Rellahan et al., 1990 McCormack et al., 1993 Webb et al., 1994). Indeed, if the CaMKIIgB* transgene did lead to memory under these circumstances we would worry that the effect was not physiologically sig- nificant. In every assay, the effect of CaMKIIgB* was to enhance a natural process of proliferation and memory formation.
We believe that there are two possibilities to explain an increase in the number of memory cells.
One relates to the fate of antigen-activated T cells.
Such cells either undergo activation-induced cell death or differentiate to form memory cells, and it is possible that CaMKIIg regulates this fate decision.
A second possibility is that the lifespan of the memory cell could be increased how- ever, this possibility is not tenable given the recent work showing that memory cells have an indefinite lifespan even in the absence of antigen (Sprent et al., 1997 Mu- rali-Krishna et al., 1999 Swain et al., 1999). We favor instead the idea that CaMKII regulates the differentiation into memory cells but not the maintenance of the mem- In support of this interpretation, we ory phenotype.
Cell 464 found there to be an increased antigen or superantigen- induced expansion of T cell in culture or in vivo. Move- over, at least part of this increase can be explained by a decrease in activation-induced cell death (Figure 6). The notion is that memory cells arise from dividing ef- fector cells and the level of CaMKII autonomous activity is an important regulator of survival and differentiation at this critical step.
Remarkably, this is consistent with the role of CaMKII in the induction but not the mainte- nance of LTP (Malinow et al., 1989 Otmakhov et al., 1997). In the formation of learning and memory in the brain, CaMKII acts as a decoder of the frequency of calcium oscillations (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998). Higher frequencies result in LTP, and lower frequencies result in long-term depression.
This decoding function, and memory itself, is critically dependent on the establish- ment of autonomous CaMKII kinase activity through the phosphorylation of threonine 286 (Giese et al., 1998). Is it possible that CaMKII in T cells is regulated in the similar fashion A body of work has shown that calcium oscillations occur in nonexcitable cells, and both fre- quency and amplitude can be determined by the charac- teristics of agonist-receptor interactions (Thomas et al., 1996). In particular, ligation of the TCR causes calcium oscillations in T cells, and the oscillatory frequency can be the determining factor in activation of transcription factors such as NF-AT and NFkB (Dolmetsch et al., 1997, 1998). Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that memory T cells arise from activated T cells that have undergone numerous rounds of activation-induced cell division (Opferman et al., 1999). We suggest that the duration of signaling through the TCR and other factors, such as coreceptor stimulation, may affect the fre- quency and perhaps the amplitude of calcium oscilla- tions. This, in turn, could determine the level of autono- mous CaMKII activity and the probability of survival as a memory cell.
Although we wish to draw an analogy between survival and memory in lymphocytes and LTP in neurons, there are most certainly important differences.
Intracellular calcium oscillations in lymphocytes result from the re- lease of calcium from intracellular stores and the activa- tion of store-operated calcium (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane (Zweifach and Lewis, 1993). In con- trast, calcium oscillations in postsynaptic cells result from an entirely different mechanism that involves cal- cium influx through NMDA receptors (Artola and Singer, 1993). In addition, lymphocyte memory involves survival of proliferating cells in the face of activation-induced cell death, whereas LTP occurs in a nondividing neuronal population.
We imagine that CaMKII is but one proces- sor of cell-type specific input and functions to initiate differentiation programs that are entirely divergent in lymphocytes and neurons.
We note that survival is not sufficient for enhanced memory T cell formation.
In mice expressing a Bcl-2 transgene in the T cell lineage, activation-induced cell death was decreased, but there was no observed in- crease in the number of memory cells (Strasser et al., 1991 Petschner et al., 1998). Yet, whereas Bcl-2 is not sufficient to enhance memory cell formation, it is possi- ble that it is a downstream target of CaMKII. Thymocyte Lifespan An extravagant aspect of T cell development is the mas- sive cell death that occurs as a natural part of thymic selection.
Rather than die continuously with a constant probability, thymocytes have a fixed lifespan of approxi- mately 3.5 days (Huesmann et al., 1991 Shortman et al., 1991), and we have found that this fixed lifespan is manifested in thymocyte survival in vitro as well (J. D. B., unpublished data). Thus, there must be a mechanism to keep track of time in this nondividing population.
Since CaMKIIgB* mice displayed an extended lifespan both in vivo and in vitro, the calcium-independent form of CaMKIIg thus appears to regulate the timing of pro- grammed cell death.
This may be a key to its function, both in the thymus and the generation of memory T cells.
Again, there are similarities, but also important differ- ences in comparing the thymic phenotypes of Bcl-2 and CaMKIIgB transgenic mice.
Both DP and SP thymocytes from Bcl-2 transgenic mice exhibit an increased lifespan measured in vitro (Sentman et al., 1991 Strasser et al., 1991), and we have found that DP thymocytes from Bcl-2 transgenic mice label very slowly with an estimated in vivo lifespan of more than 8 days (J. D. B. and S. M. H., unpublished data). Despite this profound effect on sur- vival, Bcl-2 mice do not have an increase in total thymo- cytes but do show a greater number of SPs and a skewed selection toward the CD8 lineage (Linette et al., 1994 Tao et al., 1994). We conclude that, separate from the survival effects of Bcl-2, CaMKII plays a part in the strict control of DP lifespan.
In this regard, it will be worthwhile to dissect how CaMKII may link up to the mechanisms that measure time.
Experimental Procedures Animals All mice were bred and maintained in the animal facility at the Univer- sity of California, San Diego. AND T cell antigen receptor transgenic mice were previously described (Kaye et al., 1989). CaMKIIg-B*-32 transgenic mice were generated at the Scripps Research Institute by Jenny Price.
CaMKIIg-B*-50 transgenic mice were generated by the UCSD Transgenic Core by Michelle Paulus. Inbred mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.
Cell Culture, NTOC, and Transfection Thymus, LN, and spleen cells were harvested and maintained in RPMI media as previously described (Sharp et al., 1997). Two rounds of B cell depletion were carried out using sheep anti-mouse IgM from Dynal as per manufacturer s instructions.
Memory cells were enriched by depleting for B cells and MEL-14 (L-selectin) positive cells.
Jurkat cells were transfected as described with an efficiency of 5% 30% (Jacinto et al., 1998). For NTOC, neonatal thymus organs were removed from 1-day-old pups and cultured as described (Sharp et al., 1997). For recall responses, mice were immunized with 100 mg KLH in complete Freund s adjuvant. Cells were cultured with APC and KLH for 72 hr and pulsed with 1 mCi 3H-thymidine for the last 20 hr of culture.
AND proliferation cultures were done as previously de- scribed (Sharp et al., 1997). KLH-DNP and KLH were from Calbio- chem, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Pigeon cytochrome c peptide 88 104 (PCC) and moth cytochrome c peptide 88 103 (MCC) were synthesized at the UCSD peptide facility.
Complete Freund s Adjuvant (CFA) was from Sigma Chemical Co. Plasmids and Transgenesis SRaCaMKIIg-B* was obtained from Colleen Sheridan (Nghiem et al., 1994). The insert along with the CD4 silencer was cloned into  CaMKII Influences T Cell Memory Formation 465 the XhoI site of pTEX (Zhumabekov et al., 1995) (details available upon request). The expression cassette was liberated from the plas- mid for microinjection. Eight founders were obtained of which two expressed mRNA and one was maintained (CaMKIIg-B*-32). By Southern blot analysis, we estimate that there are one to two copies integrated for this line.
For generation of CaMKIIg-B*-50 mice, CaMKIIg-B* was cloned into LL428 (N. Killeen, UCSF). LL428 is derived from construct i in Sawada et al. (1994). The expression cassette was separated from the plasmid for microinjection. Five founders were obtained, of which two expressed mRNA. Primers One set of primers was used for detection of the transgene in geno- mic DNA and in cDNA (59 primer, 5-ATGATGCATCGTCAGGAGAA-3 and 39 primer, 5-ACTGTTTTTGTTGTTGCTCTG-3). These primers did not cross-react with nontransgenic genomic DNA or endoge- nous CaMKII cDNA, since the mutated codon was included at the 39 end of the 59 primer.
Primers to b-actin were used as controls.
Flow Cytometry Antibodies to CD4 and CD8 and recombinant human Annexin V-FITC were from Caltag. Antibodies to CD5, CD62L, CD45RB, CD69, CD44, CD25, CD3, IL-2, IL-4, and IFNg were from Pharmingen. Antibody to BrdU was from Becton Dickinson. BrdU staining was done as described (Tough and Sprent, 1994). Staining for apoptotic cells using 7-amino actinomycin D (7AAD) was performed as described (Philpott et al., 1996), and the method for CFSE and intracellular cytokine staining was taken from Bird et al. (1998). Western Blots Anti-CaMKIIg was from Santa Cruz Bio.
(sc-1541). Cells were lysed in high-salt lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 5 mM beta-glycerol phosphate, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 200 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 10 mM NaF, 30 nM okadaic acid [OA], and 200 mM NaVO4). Ten to fifty micrograms total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose.
Visualization was by ECL (Amersham). The membrane was blocked in hTBS-T (20 mM Tris [pH 8], 500 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) 1 5% milk.
Primary antibody was used at 1:1000 in hTBS-T for 1 hr at room temperature.
Membrane was washed 43 in hTBS-T, and secondary incubation was for 30 min in hTBS-T with 1:2000 rabbit anti-goat HRP (Southern Biotech). Kinase Assays Cells (3 10 3 106) were lysed for 5 min on ice in 50 100 ml high-salt lysis buffer.
The lysate was precleared with 30 ml protein G Fast Flow (Pharmacia, 50% mix) for 5 30 min.
Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad assay.
Thirty to one hundred micrograms lysate was bound in high-salt lysis buffer with 5 mg anti-CaMKIIg and 30 ml protein G overnight.
Lysate was spun and beads washed 43 with high-salt lysis buffer (no protease inhibitors) and 13 with kinase buffer (50 mM PIPES [pH 7], 10 mM MgCl2). The kinase reaction was started by the addition of 15 ml CK kinase reaction buffer (50 mM PIPES [pH 7], 10 mM MgCl2 1 10 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 10 ml cold ATP, 5 mCi g-P32-ATP, and 10 mM AC-2 [Calbiochem]) with combinations of 10 mg/ml human brain calmodulin (Calbio- chem), 4 mM EGTA, or 2 mM CaCl2, and incubation was at 308C. Reaction was stopped by addition of 8 ml 63 sample buffer after 5 10 min or after 80 s for EGTA or Ca12 conditions, respectively.
Kinase reactions were run on a 20% 23 gel for resolution of AC-2.
SEB Responses In Vivo CaMKIIgB*-50 transgenic mice were crossed with B10.D2 mice to produce CaMKIIgB*-50 H-2bxd and wild-type H-2bxd offspring.
These mice express H-2E molecules that allow them to respond to SEB at low doses.
Ten micrograms of SEB was injected intraperitoneally in PBS. Blood from each mouse was collected at different time points, and white blood cells were stained with FITC anti-Vb8 or anti-Vb6 (Pharmingen), PE anti-CD4 (Pharmingen), and Tricolor anti- CD8 (Caltag).
