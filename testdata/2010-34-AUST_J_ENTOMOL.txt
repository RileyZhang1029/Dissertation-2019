Abstract

Bactrocera tryoni is a polyphagous fruit ﬂy, originally endemic to tropical and subtropical coastal
eastern Australia, but now also widely distributed in temperate eastern Australia. In temperate parts of
its range, B. tryoni populations show distinct seasonal peaks driven by changing seasonal climates,
especially changing temperature. In contrast to temperate areas, the seasonal phenology of B. tryoni in
subtropical and tropical parts of its range is poorly documented and the role of climate unknown. Using
a large, historical (1940s and 1950s) fruit ﬂy trapping dataset, we present the seasonal phenology of B.
tryoni at nine sites across Queensland for multiple (two to seven) years per site. We correlate monthly
trap data for each site with monthly weather averages (temperature, rainfall and relative humidity) to
investigate climatic inﬂuences. We also correlate observed population data with predicted population
data generated by an existing B. tryoni population model. Supporting predictions from climate driven
models, B. tryoni did show year-round breeding at most Queensland sites. However, contrary to
predictions, there was a common pattern of a signiﬁcant population decline in autumn and winter,
followed by a rapid population increase in August and then one or more distinct peaks of abundance
in spring and summer. Mean monthly ﬂy abundance was signiﬁcantly different across sites, but was not
correlated with altitudinal,
latitudinal or longitudinal gradients. There were very few signiﬁcant
correlations between monthly ﬂy population size and weather variables (either for the corresponding
month or for up to 3 months previously) for eight of the nine sites. For the southern site of Gatton ﬂy
population abundance was correlated with temperature. Results suggest that although climate factors
may be inﬂuencing patterns of B. tryoni population abundance in southern subtropical Queensland, they
are not explaining patterns of abundance in northern subtropical and tropical Queensland. In the
discussion we focus on the role of other factors, particularly larval host plant availability, as likely
drivers of B. tryoni abundance in tropical and subtropical parts of its range.

INTRODUCTION

Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (Queen-
sland fruit ﬂy or Q-ﬂy), is one of the most serious insect pests
of horticulture in eastern Australia (Dominiak et al. 2003a).
Eggs are laid directly into the host fruit where larvae develop
before leaving the fruit to pupate in the soil. Losses caused by
Q-ﬂy are as a result of direct fruit losses, costs of ﬁeld control,
and the post-harvest treatment costs required for domestic or
international market access.

Q-ﬂy is endemic and widely distributed in tropical and
subtropical eastern Australia (May 1963; Zalucki et al. 1984)
and, with the exception of the ‘fruit ﬂy free zone’ where active
population suppression is maintained, is now also permanently

established in temperate NSW and parts of Victoria (Bateman
1967; Fletcher 1979; O’Loughlin et al. 1984). In temperate
regions the ﬂy is multivoltine, but shows distinct climate
driven seasonality, with populations over-wintering as non-
reproductive adults and then breeding in spring and summer
(Bateman 1968; Fletcher 1975, 1979). The seasonal popula-
tion patterns of B. tryoni in temperate areas are driven by
temperature, rainfall and environmental moisture (Bateman
1968; Dominiak et al. 2003b), with temperature being the
major environmental driver (Bateman 1968; Pritchard 1970;
Fletcher 1975, 1979).

In contrast to the well-documented ecology of B. tryoni in
temperate Australia, almost nothing is known about B. tryoni’s
population ecology in the endemic parts of its range. In Stan-
thorpe, a high-altitude, cold-winter area, Cowley et al. (1990)
recorded few or no fruit ﬂy catches during winter months, a
result that reﬂects a typical, temperate pattern. Marked sea-
sonal changes in the population abundance of B. tryoni in

other, less temperate parts of the state have also been recorded
(Drew & Hooper 1983; Drew et al. 1984; Lloyd et al. 2007);
however, and what inﬂuences these patterns is less clear. Drew
et al. (1984) found that B. tryoni abundance was less limited
by temperature and rainfall in the subtropics, but rather host
availability and ﬂy dispersion were thought to play more
important roles. Similar interpretations have been made for B.
tryoni in subtropical areas (Raghu et al. 2000) and for other
tropical tephritids, for example, other Bactrocera spp. (Drew
et al. 1984; Tan & Serit 1994) and Anastrepha spp. (Hurtado
et al. 1995). Even in temperate areas, abundance of over-
wintering B. tryoni in orchard habitats is dependent on fruit
availability (Sonleitner & Bateman 1963; Bateman 1968;
Fletcher 1973, 1974). Existing population models for Q-ﬂy
(Yonow & Sutherst 1998; Yonow et al. 2004) indicate likely
relative abundance if fruit is always available for breeding, but
this is clearly not the case in orchard production systems, or in
tropical rainforests where fruiting patterns are generally highly
seasonal (Boulter et al. 2006).

Presented as part of his PhD, May (1961) carried out fruit
ﬂy trapping across multiple Queensland sites over multiple
years in the 1940s and 1950s. Because of the untimely death of
Alan May, this very large and valuable dataset was never
published. Formally analysing this historical dataset for the
ﬁrst time, we present in this paper data on the population
phenology of B. tryoni populations at nine Queensland sites.
Speciﬁcally, we: (1) compare and contrast average annual
population phenologies of B. tryoni at nine sites across Queen-
sland, ranging from temperate Stanthorpe to tropical Cairns;
and (2) investigate the role of abiotic variables (monthly
average temperature, rainfall and relative humidity) in driving
the large-scale phenological patterns observed. We further use
the dataset to independently assess the applicability of a
process-based, B. tryoni population model (Yonow et al. 2004)

to subtropical and tropical environments by determining the
degree of correlation between observed population data and
predicted data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study sites

Nine Queensland sites are used in this paper, ranging from
Stanthorpe in the south to Cairns in the north (Table 1). Across
this range the sites vary signiﬁcantly in their climate, with
Stanthorpe having an essentially temperate climate (despite its
subtropical location) with a very marked and cold winter,
whereas Cairns is located in the wet tropics and has a true
tropical monsoon climate. Depending on their location, sites in
between are affected to a greater or lesser extent by contrasting
temperate and tropical inﬂuences. As a historical dataset, it is
important to keep in mind that the current usage of the land
may not be what it was in the 1950s. For example, Sunnybank,
now a suburb of Brisbane, was then a productive small-crop
and orchard area, whereas tropical fruit production, now
common in areas of the north and far-north, was rare.

Data collection

Fly trapping was carried out by Allen May and colleagues of
the (Queensland) Department of Primary Industries and Fish-
eries from 1944 to 1959. For any one location, fruit ﬂy trap-
ping was carried out for 2–7 years and could be carried out at
one or more ‘trapping stations’ (Table 1). Ten traps were main-
tained at each trapping station and all trapping stations were
located in fruit growing areas where traps were placed in host
trees. Trapping was conducted using a liquid lure as described

pulped orange (10 ounces (=283 g)), ammonium carbonate
(0.5 ounces (=14.2 g)) and rain water (1 pint (=0.57L)), held
for 24 h in a closed container. The lure was used in McPhail
traps after being diluted with water at 1:30 lure: water ratio.
This formula attracts both male and female B. tryoni, in con-
trast to the male-speciﬁc lures that are more commonly used
for contemporary monitoring.

Traps were hung permanently in host trees and serviced
weekly. Trapped ﬂies were examined under 5¥ magniﬁcation
in 70% alcohol and identiﬁed for species, sex and then, fol-
lowing dissection, age group (teneral, non-gravid (females
only), mature). Trap data are presented in May’s (1961) thesis
as stacked vertical columns (i.e. for each week the number of
immature males, mature males, immature females, non-gravid
females and mature females are stacked in a single column to
represent the week’s total catch). This column data were tran-
scribed from the graphs into Excel spreadsheet format by DM.

Data summation

Analyses or data presentations (see next section) were carried
out using weekly or monthly data (i.e. summed weekly catches
within a calendar month), depending on the analysis or pre-
sentation. Combining weekly data could hide potentially
important weekly variation, for example, the result of short
term weather variation, and for this reason correlations
between weather and population were done on weekly data.
However, presenting weekly data in graphs or ﬁgures can be
visually overwhelming, without supplying signiﬁcant addi-
tional information. For this reason, phenology curves are pre-
sented using monthly data. The reader is referred to May’s
(1961) thesis, held by The University of Queensland library, if
they wish to view weekly phenology data.

Inter-site comparisons of mean monthly B.
tryoni abundance and phenology

Mean monthly catch was compared across the nine sites (using
one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey HSD post-hoc test) to
look at broad changes in B. tryoni abundance across Queen-
sland. Correlations between latitude, longitude and altitude
and mean monthly catch per site were carried out to determine
if variation in ﬂy abundance between sites was related to
geographic location of the site.

Seasonal phenologies across sites were compared through
visual comparison of mean monthly population curves for total
males and total females. Annual phenology graphs were gen-
erated using mature female, immature female and teneral (both
sexes, May did not present separate teneral data for each sex)
age classes after having converted monthly trap data for each
age class to a proportion of the total annual catch for that age
class. The data presented in these latter graphs are the mean
monthly data for the site (as for male/female phenologies), but
are presented without a measure of error. This is done for
visual clarity and because only very broad-scale phenological

patterns are discussed, for which measures of error are largely
unimportant.

Comparison of trap catches with weather data

Relationships between weekly trap catches within a site and
weather variables (mean weekly temperature, total rainfall,
mean weekly relative humidity) were tested using multiple
linear multiple regression analysis. Weather data correspond-
ing to the trapping location and dates were obtained from the
SILO Data Drill (http://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/)
and was site- and time-speciﬁc. In addition to the correlation
between weather variables and trap catch in the same week,
correlations were also done on weather variables lagged 4, 8
and 12 weeks before the trap catch, to test for weather effects
on earlier life stages and/or generations.

Comparison of observed data with model
predicted data

Yonow et al. (2004) modelled Q-ﬂy population dynamics
using DYMEX®. DYMEX® is a process-based, modular
modelling software package for the development of cohort-
based, life-cycle models. Both internal (e.g. within a life cycle)
and external (e.g. environmental) processes can be incorpo-
rated into a model, each affecting the different life stages
within an organism’s life cycle, so determining the survival,
age and physiological status of individuals within a cohort
(where a cohort is a group of individuals of a user-deﬁned
abundance and stage (e.g. 100 eggs; Maywald et al. 1999).

The main feature of Yonow et al.’s (2004) model of B.
tryoni population dynamics is that the life stage properties are
primarily regulated by climatic variables (i.e. temperature,
rainfall, soil moisture, evaporation) and host fruit availability
is held constant. The population phenologies thus generated
represent the perceived inﬂuence of climate. Using climate to
generate Q-ﬂy phenologies is a valid assumption, at least for
temperate parts of Australia, as temperature and rainfall are
considered to drive the system in these regions (Bateman
1968; Meats 1981; O’Loughlin et al. 1984). Model validation
runs by Yonow et al. using data from three temperate sites and
regressing observed data against predicted data, produced sig-
niﬁcant R2 values of 0.16, 0.27 and 0.37 (d.f. =, respectively,
85, 60 and 114). Thus although the explanatory power of the
model is relatively low (as recognised by the model authors),
the model is still thought to capture the major features of Q-ﬂy
population dynamics. We used Yonow et al.’s model to predict
the population dynamics of B. tryoni at our nine subtropical
and tropical sites and compared the predicted results with the
observed population data from May’s thesis. We wished to
determine if the pattern of Q-ﬂy population dynamics in
Queensland matched that observed in other states, as exempli-
ﬁed by the model.

The DYMEX model we used was as described and param-
eterised by Yonow et al. (2004). Two consecutive calendar
years, beginning on 1 January, were used for the simulation
run for each site. The years chosen for the simulations were

randomly selected within the years that each site was sampled.
Because the model runs on daily time steps, corresponding
daily meteorological data (daily average temperature, rain fall
and daily average relative humidity) was obtained from the
SILO Data Drill for each of the nine sites for the relevant years
(Cairns 1952/1953, Atherton 1956/1957, Ayr 1952/1953,
Rockhampton 1954/1955, Maryborough 1957/1958, Too-
woomba 1951/1952, Gatton 1950/1951, Sunnybank 1952/
1953, Stanthorpe 1954/1955). Initialisation values for the
model runs were as used by Yonow et al. (2004). Correlations
between predicted and observed data were done using weekly
interval data.

RESULTS

Inter-site comparisons of B. tryoni abundance

There was signiﬁcant variation in mean monthly B. tryoni
abundance across the nine sampling sites. There were no
obvious patterns in the abundance between sites, with some
neighbouring sites (e.g. Cairns and Atherton) having quite
different abundance levels, and quite disjunct sites (e.g. Ather-
ton and Gatton) having very similar levels (Fig. 1). There was
no correlation between mean monthly abundance at a site and
site latitude (r = 0.16, P = 0.07), longitude (r = 0.14, P = 0.14)
or altitude (r = -0.05, P = 0.60).

Seasonal abundance

Bactrocera tryoni populations were trapped throughout the
year in six of the nine locations, but were not trapped for one

or more months in Cairns, Maryborough and Stanthorpe
(Fig. 2). All sites showed distinct periods of high and low
population abundance, with reproductive potential clearly not
uniform throughout the year. Cairns, Atherton, Rockhampton
and Toowoomba had a unimodal pattern of B. tryoni abun-
dance, with a rapid rise in population numbers in mid- to
late-spring, followed by an equally dramatic drop in numbers
over summer leading into a period of low abundance in
autumn and winter (this phenology pattern will be described
as a ‘type I’ pattern for the remainder of the paper). Ayr,
Maryborough and Sunnybank had two or more population
peaks in the annual cycle (type II phenology pattern), with
each again showing the rapid population increase in spring,
which typiﬁed the type I pattern. Gatton and Stanthorpe
(type III) showed less dramatic post-wintering population
growth, with their populations increasing gradually during
spring and summer to a late summer/early autumn peak,
before declining again into winter.

Low abundance in many sites was represented by zero or
near-zero values and these coincide with late autumn and
winter months. The duration of the period of low abundance,
however, was highly variable ranging from 3 to 4 months in
some sites (e.g. Cairns, Atherton, Rockhampton, Marybor-
ough, Toowoomba, Sunnybank and Stanthorpe) and as short as
1 month in others (Ayr and Gatton) (Fig. 2). Low abundance
cannot be directly attributable to cold winter temperatures
only, as even tropical sites (e.g. Cairns) showed such periods.
The timing of the initiation of population increase following
the period of low abundance differed between sites and ranged
from July to September. There was no obvious latitudinal
effect on the initiation of population increase as might be

all sites, even when population numbers were very low
(Fig. 3). Determining voltinism from the information in
Figure 3 is difﬁcult, but the presence of tenerals throughout the
year at most sites is indicative of continual breeding (i.e.
multivoltinism).

The initial spring population, in nearly all cases, consists on
non-gravid or gravid females – but not tenerals. Non-gravid
females appeared with or before gravid females in some sites
(e.g. Stanthorpe, Cairns and Sunnybank) and thus we infer that
ﬂies during the period of low abundance (at least in the southern
parts of Queensland) may resorb follicles, as is known to occur

in NSW (Pritchard 1970). That non-gravid females also
appeared ﬁrst in tropical Cairns suggests egg resorption may
not only be driven by cold temperatures, but may also be moder-
ated by other factors. We can also not dismiss the possibility that
non-gravid females are from tenerals that have dispersed/
moved into the trapping location from another locality.

the sum of proportions for the three age classes for any given month can exceed 1.

The teneral ﬂies that build up rapidly in the spring are likely
the F1 generation of the ﬂies present during the period of low
population abundance. The appearance of teneral ﬂies in Too-
woomba, Maryborough and Ayr occurs at the same time as the

appearance of gravid and non-gravid females in late winter. In
contrast, F1 generation teneral ﬂies appeared 1 or 2 months

type II population phenology groups, the teneral ﬂies built up
very rapidly in the spring population. However, in the type
III populations (particularly Stanthorpe),
the increase in
the teneral population is delayed in initiation and slower in
build up.

Population ﬂuctuation and weather

Correlations between B. tryoni trap catch and weather vari-
ables were inconsistent across the state. Multiple linear regres-
sion analysis detected signiﬁcant correlations between weather
variables and weekly trap catch for the two most southern sites
(Gatton and Stanthorpe) and the three most northern sites
(Cairns, Atherton and Ayr), but not the four intermediate sites
(Table 2). The partial correlation coefﬁcient values for the
signiﬁcant southern and northern sites did not follow the same
pattern. For the southern sites, temperature was clearly the
most important variable within the multiple regression, with
rainfall less important and negatively correlated with abun-
dance: relative humidity was unimportant. For the northern
sites, temperature and relative humidity were equally impor-
tant and were positively and negatively correlated, respec-
tively, with population abundance. Rainfall was positively
correlated with abundance, but to a lesser extent than the other
two variables. Correlations on time lagged weather data pro-
vided no additional insights as very few correlations were
signiﬁcant. Results of the time-lagged analysis are provided in
Muthuthantri (2008).

Fit with DYMEX model

Model predictions, as assessed through correlation between
predicted and observed weekly data, were generally poor, par-
ticularly for the subtropical sites. Fly populations were pre-
dicted to breed continuously throughout the year in northern
tropical sites (Cairns, Atherton, Ayr, Rockhampton) (Fig. 4),
but only correlations for female ﬂies in Cairns and Ayr, male
ﬂies in Cairns and teneral ﬂies in Ayr were signiﬁcant
(Table 3). In the subtropical sites, the model predicted that
continuous breeding populations should not occur throughout
the year, with reproductive males and females going into an
over-wintering stage during part, or all, of the winter months.
Maryborough appears to be on the geographic boundary where

ﬂies cease breeding in the winter months, with ﬂies predicted
to enter the over-wintering stage in 1957, but not 1958 (Fig. 4).
Predictive power of the model was again weak for the southern
sites, with only Stanthorpe showing consistent positive corre-
lations between observed and predicted populations.

Unexpectedly, many sites showed negative correlations
between observed and predicted data, which in two cases
(Atherton and Sunnybank, female ﬂies) were signiﬁcant (i.e.
model-predicted ﬂy populations should be declining when
actual populations were increasing, and vice versa). The nega-
tive correlations indicate that the model is obviously failing to
capture key elements of the population dynamics of Q-ﬂy in
subtropical and tropical areas.

DISCUSSION

Hurtado et al. (1995) consider that a minimum of 3–4 years of
population data should be analysed to gain a proper represen-
tation of fruit ﬂy population phenology in a given locality,
especially if the year to year ﬂuctuation is variable. Population
data from seven of the nine sites in this study fulﬁl this require-
ment and we believe the dataset gives a valid overview of the
population phenology of B. tryoni in Queensland. Changes in
land use in the 50+ years since this data were collected means
that a current worker could not, with conﬁdence, use the data
presented here for any given site, but broad phenological pat-
terns, particularly with respect to interactions with climate
variables, should still be relevant.

Previous studies have predicted that up to 15 generations per
year of B. tryoni could potentially occur in northern parts of
the ﬂy’s range (Meats 1981; Yonow & Sutherst 1998). These
predictions have, however, been almost exclusively based on
research undertaken in temperature Australia and assume
abiotic conditions (particularly temperature) are the drivers of
Q-ﬂy population dynamics in all parts of its range. In contrast,
the major results of this study are that the inﬂuence of abiotic
weather variables are not consistent across the subtropics and
tropics and at least one existing population model that is based
largely on climate drivers (Yonow et al. 2004), has little pre-
dictive capacity for most Queensland sites (Table 3). This
discussion focuses on the role of the abiotic variables (tem-

role of natural enemies as these are thought to have only a very
minor impact on B. tryoni populations (Snowball 1966; Water-
house & Sands 2001).

Impact of temperature on B. tryoni populations
in subtropical Queensland

In temperate parts of Australia, B. tryoni breeding is curtailed
in winter because of mean temperatures falling below thresh-
olds required for ovarian maturation (13.5°C) (Pritchard 1970)
and mating (16°C) (Meats & Fay 1976). However, for Queen-
sland, only the most southern sites are likely to have cold
temperature inﬂuenced breeding patterns. Ovarian maturation
in B. tryoni is not driven solely by a minimum temperature
threshold, but depends more on appropriate day degree accu-
mulation (which itself is driven by the length and magnitude of
the maximum and minimum daily temperatures) (Fletcher
1975; Meats & Khoo 1976). Mean monthly winter tempera-
tures for most of the sites (Fig. 2) are around 14–16°C or
higher (i.e. above threshold) and even if, during the coldest
periods, favourable temperatures persist for sufﬁcient time
during the day such that ovarian maturation rate exceeds
absorption rate (Meats & Khoo 1976), then ongoing egg laying
is possible. This is seen even in southern sites such as Gatton
and Sunnybank, where breeding (as evidenced by the presence
of teneral ﬂies) is almost continuous through the year,
although signiﬁcantly reduced in winter (Fig. 3). Only in Stan-
thorpe is breeding almost certainly curtailed for several
months because of winter temperatures.

Although breeding is continuous or near-continuous at most
sites, winter temperatures in the southern sites appear marginal
for breeding (Gatton, Sunnybank, Toowoomba and Marybor-
ough) (Fig. 2). Maryborough appears to be on the edge of this
unfavourable range (Fig. 4), with teneral ﬂy populations
apparent during the colder months, even though the mean
temperatures are marginally suitable for breeding and mating
(Figs 2,3). Minimum temperatures at Maryborough during
winter are well above those required for larval and pupal
development and, so long as eggs are laid, the local population
will continue to develop.

Survival of B. tryoni is terminated by continuous and pro-
longed (i.e. 5–7 days) exposure to subzero temperatures
(Meats 1976; Fletcher 1979). However, low abundance of B.
tryoni in temperate areas in winter need not be caused by
low temperature induced mortality, but may be because ﬂies
migrate to winter refuge sites, such as forest (Fletcher 1979).
For our study sites in Queensland, zero or subzero tempera-
tures are rare, although overnight lows in this range do occur
routinely during winter in Stanthorpe and occasionally also
in Toowoomba. It is thus reasonable to assume that the low
or zero population sizes exhibited in southern sites in June
and July are not as a result of cold-induced mortality, but are
more likely as a result of dispersal of ﬂies to sheltering sites
and a failure to collect them in traps, or alternatively the ﬂies
may not be physiologically responsive to the traps in cooler
months because of temperature induced delays in sexual
maturity.

Role of rainfall and humidity

tryoni

Summer abundance of B.
in temperate regions is
strongly inﬂuenced by rainfall, possibly because pupal emer-
gence is favoured by moisture availability in the air and in the
soil (Bateman 1968). O’Loughlin (1964) observed that the ﬂy
population growth increases signiﬁcantly in temperate areas if
summer rainfall is above 170 mm per month, but such popu-
lation growth does not occur if summer rainfall is below this
level. Rainfall, however, had the lowest partial correlation
coefﬁcients for each of our nine sites (Table 2). Given this
conﬂict between our data and that of Bateman and
O’Loughlin, we suspect
in southern temperate areas
(which have wet winters but dry summers) rainfall can be
limiting to ﬂies during summer, whereas in the tropics which
have a spring/summer dominated rainfall pattern, no such limi-
tation occurs. Relative humidity, but not rainfall, was nega-
tively correlated with ﬂy abundance in our two most northern
sites and may be a reason why ﬂy population decline during
summer in the tropical north.

that

Host availability

Data on fruit phenology were not collected by May (1961) and
so we cannot formally test a link between fruit availability and
ﬂy phenology. Even indirect attempts to do this are con-
founded by the passage of time. Sunnybank, for example, was
a major fruit production area in the 1950s, but is now simply
part of Brisbane’s urban sprawl and so it is difﬁcult to deter-
mine what hosts may have been available. Nevertheless, in the
absence of direct temperature, rainfall or humidity effects,
ecological differences such as host availability and site condi-
tions (e.g. surrounding rural, urban or forest habitats) are alter-
native explanatory variables of inter- and intra-site variation in
total abundance and phenology patterns, as is the case for other
fruit ﬂies (Aluja et al. 1996; Leblanc & Allwood 1997; Lewe-
niqila et al. 1997; Tora Vueti et al. 1997; Raghu et al. 2000;
Raghu & Clarke 2001; Dominiak et al. 2006). In terms of total
population abundance,
that both Sunnybank and
Gatton were small crops producing areas in the 1950s (as
Gatton still is), with the potential of supplying near year-round
host availability for B. tryoni, may be an important reason why
ﬂies were so abundant at those sites (Fig. 1).

the fact

All sites north of Maryborough have year-round tempera-
ture conditions favourable for B. tryoni’s normal activities
(e.g. mating, foraging and egg development) and ﬂies should
be able to successfully reproduce at these sites at all times of
the year (Yonow & Sutherst 1998). However, populations at
these sites show distinct ﬂuctuations during the year which are
generally not correlated to weather variables (Table 2). As an
extreme example, B. tryoni was rare or absent in Cairns for
half the year from January to July (Fig. 2), although the more
common pattern across sites was for continuous breeding, but
with distinct peaks of abundance. In the absence of climatic
correlates to explain population variation, we assume these
peaks and troughs are matched by, respectively, an availability
or absence of hosts. For example, ﬂowering and fruit set in
northern tropical rainforests is highly seasonal and peaks
around the beginning of the wet season in October/November
(Boulter et al. 2006 and references therein). This fruiting peak
is a likely driver of the dramatic peak of abundance of ﬂies in
Cairns, which in the 1950s would have been almost entirely
generated through rainforest breeding. Out of the fruiting
season, the absence of suitable host fruits may have caused
ﬂies to migrate away from Cairns, explaining the absence of
ﬂies at that site. Many other studies have demonstrated posi-
tive correlations between fruit ﬂy abundance and host avail-
ability (Tan & Serit 1994; Hurtado et al. 1995; Aluja et al.
1996; Papadopoulos et al. 2001; Hong & Hui 2005).

Implications for management

Data presented in this paper have important implications for
both research and management. From a management perspec-
tive it is clear that it is no longer sufﬁcient to simply say, or
infer, that based on weather variables Q-ﬂy is always abundant
in its endemic range. Rather, the ﬂy shows distinct seasonal
depression in populations across the whole state and this offers
promise as a component of market access discussions. A prob-
able link between local ﬂy abundance and local fruit availabil-
ity also suggests
that attempting area-wide population
suppression through control of feral and non-commercial
hosts, as well as commercial hosts, is probably justiﬁable.
Both area-wide management and periods of low pest pressure

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This work would not have been possible without the dedica-
tion of the late Dr Alan May and his many colleagues and
collaborators. Unfortunately, datasets of the type presented in
his thesis are essentially impossible to generate in the current
age. Dr May is not listed as an author simply because we
cannot be certain he would have agreed with the interpretation
of his data, but we fully acknowledge his pivotal role in this
work. Drs S. Raghu and Robert Sutherst made highly valuable
comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript. Mr Gunter
Maywald gave valuably of his time and knowledge in helping
to get the Dymex model running.
