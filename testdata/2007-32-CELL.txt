DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.046 SUMMARY Regulation of mammalian mtDNA gene expression is critical for altering oxidative phosphorylation capacity in response to physiological demands and disease processes.
The basal machinery for initiation of mtDNA transcription has been molecularly defined, but the mechanisms regulating its activity are poorly understood.
In this study, we show that MTERF3 is a negative regulator of mtDNA transcription initiation.
The MTERF3 gene is essential because homozygous knockout mouse embryos die in midgestation.
Tissue-specific inactivation of MTERF3 in the heart causes aberrant mtDNA transcription and severe respiratory chain deficiency.
MTERF3 binds the mtDNA promoter region and depletion of MTERF3 increases transcription initiation on both mtDNA strands.
This increased transcription initiation leads to decreased expression of critical promoter-distal tRNA genes, which is possibly explained by transcriptional collision on the circular mtDNA molecule.
To our knowledge, MTERF3 is the first example of a mitochondrial protein that acts as a specific repressor of mammalian mtDNA transcription initiation in vivo.
INTRODUCTION Deficient oxidative phosphorylation plays an important role in various types of human pathologies, such as inherited mitochondrial diseases (Smeitink et al., 2001), age-associated common diseases (Lin and Beal, 2006), and aging (Lin and Beal, 2006; Trifunovic, 2006).
Mito chondrial function must be regulated in response to a vari ety of metabolic demands occurring in normal physiolog ical processes.
The large number of proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and the dual genetic origin of these proteins make regulation complex.
An increase in oxidative phosphorylation capacity necessitates a con certed activation of transcription of both mtDNA and nuclear genes.
The basal mitochondrial transcription machinery has been molecularly defined, and all of the necessary compo nents are encoded by nuclear genes and imported into mitochondria.
A combination of three proteins, i.e., mito chondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), mitochondrial tran scription factor A (TFAM), and mitochondrial transcription factor B1 or B2 (TFB1M or TFB2M) are sufficient and nec essary for specific initiation of transcription from mtDNA promoters in vitro (Falkenberg et al., 2002).
TFAM is an abundant high-mobility-group-box protein that has at least two separate functions in mammalian mitochondria.
It has the capacity to bind and bend DNA (Parisi and Clayton, 1991) and likely contributes to the packaging of mtDNA into nucleoids (Ekstrand et al., 2004).
A direct role for TFAM in mtDNA maintenance is further supported by the observation that knockout of TFAM leads to loss of mtDNA (Larsson et al., 1998) and overexpression of TFAM upregulates mtDNA copy number in the mouse (Ekstrand et al., 2004).
In addition to its role as a structural protein, TFAM also functions as a basal transcription factor (Dair aghi et al., 1995), and not even abortive transcription can occur in its absence (Gaspari et al., 2004).
Both TFB1M and TFB2M form stable heterodimers with POLRMT, but TFB2M is at least an order of magnitude more active than TFB1M in promoting in vitro transcription initiation (Falkenberg et al., 2002).
Interestingly, TFB1M and TFB2M are homologous to bacterial dimethyladenosine transfer ases and may therefore also have a role in rRNA modifica tion (Falkenberg et al., 2002; Seidel-Rogol et al., 2003).
The distinct in vivo roles for TFB1M and TFB2M remain to be elucidated.
The nuclear respiratory factors (NRF1 and NRF2) con trol the basal expression of many nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (Scarpulla, 2006; Wu et al., 1999).
There is accumulating evidence that the PGC-1 group of nuclear transcription factors (Pgc1a, Pgc1b, and PRC) are master regulators that can be induced by environmen tal stimuli to activate the expression of nuclear genes encoding proteins necessary for oxidative phosphoryla tion (Lin et al., 2005; Scarpulla, 2006).
Pgc1a is the most Cell 130, 273285, July 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 273 mailto:claes.gustafsson@ki.se mailto:nils-goran.larsson@ki.se studied member of this group of transcription factors and disruption of its gene leads to decreased expression of TFAM (Lin et al., 2004).
Increased expression of Pgc1a can directly activate expression of TFAM and thereby provides a pathway to increase copy number and overall expression of mtDNA (Wu et al., 1999).
However, TFAM is a very abun dant protein fully coating mtDNA, and may therefore not be ideal for rapid adjustment of mtDNA transcription ac cording to metabolic needs.
It therefore appears likely that additional factors must regulate the basal mtDNA tran scription machinery to allow fine-tuning in response to demands for oxidative phosphorylation capacity.
In this paper, we show that a previously uncharacterized mammalian protein denoted mitochondrial transcrip tion termination factor 3 (MTERF3) (Linder et al., 2005) is located in mitochondria where it interacts with the mtDNA promoter region and functions as a transcriptional re pressor.
Loss of MTERF3 is embryonically lethal, and tissue-specific knockout of Mterf3 in the heart leads to increased transcription initiation on both strands of mtDNA, decreased steady-state levels of promoter-distal transcripts, and, eventually, mitochondrial dysfunction.
In conclusion, MTERF3 is, to our knowledge, the first exam ple of a mitochondrial protein that acts as a specific negative regulator of mammalian mtDNA transcription initiation in vivo.
RESULTS MTERF3 Is a Mitochondrial Protein Bioinformatics analyses were used to predict subcellular localization of the human MTERF3 protein.
The three soft ware programs usedMitoProt (99.6%), TargetP (92.1%), and PSORT (73.9%)gave a high probability for mito chondrial localization.
We performed northern blot analy ses and found that Mterf3 is ubiquitously expressed, con sistent with the prediction that the Mterf3 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein (Figure 1A).
We transfected HeLa cells with plasmids encoding a fusion protein consisting of MTERF3 fused at its carboxy terminus to green fluores cent protein (MTERF3-GFP).
The intracellular localization of MTERF3-GFP overlapped perfectly with mitochondria labeled with the fluorophore mitotracker (Figure 1B).
Next, we studied import of recombinant [35S]-methio nine-labeled human MTERF3 into isolated rat liver mito chondria (Figure 1C).
Import of full-length MTERF3 into mitochondria generated a protein species of lower molec ular weight, showing that the targeting sequence is cleaved after import.
The generation of this processed MTERF3 protein was inhibited by the addition of the un coupler CCCP, consistent with the fact that mitochondrial protein import is typically dependent on a potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
Additionally, the processed MTERF3 protein was resistant to trypsin treat ment, whereas the full-length MTERF3 protein was de graded.
These findings show that MTERF3 is a mitochon drial protein.
274 Cell 130, 273285, July 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. MTERF3 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development We generated a conditional knockout allele for Mterf3 by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells (Figures 2A and 2B).
The allele was transmitted through the mouse germ line and the resulting heterozygous (Mterf3+/neo-loxP) mice were mated with Flp-deleter mice (Rodriguez et al., 2000) to remove the neomycin resis tance gene by Flp-Frt-mediated recombination in vivo, thus generating heterozygous mice with a loxP-flanked Mterf3 allele (Mterf3+/loxP).
The Mterf3+/loxP mice were crossed to b-actin-cre mice (Larsson et al., 1998) and het erozygous knockouts (Mterf3+/) were obtained (Fig ure 2C).
Next, we intercrossed Mterf3+/mice, but no ho mozygous knockouts (Mterf3/) were born.
Analysis of staged embryos revealed that the Mterf3/embryos Figure 1.

were much smaller than wild-type embryos at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) (Figure 2E).
No viable Mterf3/embryos were recovered at E10.5.
These results are consistent with previous reports showing that abolished oxidative phosphorylation typically results in embryonic lethality at E8.5 (Hance et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 1998).
We confirmed that the embryonic lethality was due to the absence of a functional Mterf3 gene by performing genetic rescue experiments.
A bacterial artificial clone (BAC) containing the Mterf3 gene was engineered to generate a synony mous codon change abolishing a PstI restriction site in the Mterf3 coding sequence (see Figure S1 in the Supple mental Data available with this article online).
This modi fied BAC was injected into pronuclei of fertilized oocytes to obtain heterozygous transgenic (+/BAC-Mterf3) mice.
We performed crosses and obtained viable and appar ently normal mice of the genotype Mterf3/; +/BAC Mterf3, showing that the homozygous Mterf3 knockouts Cell 130, 273285, July 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 275 Figure 3.

can be rescued by reintroduction of the Mterf3 gene (Figure 2F).
Loss of MTERF3 Causes Severe Mitochondrial Dysfunction We bred Mterf3loxP mice to transgenic mice expressing cre-recombinase from the muscle creatinine kinase pro moter (Hansson et al., 2004) to disrupt Mterf3 in heart (Figure 2D) and skeletal muscle.
These tissue-specific knockout animals had a dramatically shortened life span with a maximal longevity of 18 weeks (Figure 3A).
We ob served a gradual increase of both relative (Figure 3B) and absolute heart size (Figures S2A and S2B) in the tissue specific knockouts.
Electron micrographs of heart tissue from terminal-stage Mterf3 knockouts revealed abundant abnormal mitochondria, consistent with severe respira tory chain deficiency (Figure 3C).
Quantification of mito chondrial volume density showed an increase in relative mitochondrial mass in hearts of Mterf3 knockouts in comparison with controls at age 12 weeks (143% 2%; mean SEM) and 16 weeks (192% 4%; mean SEM).

The Mterf3 transcript was absent in heart of end-stage tissue-specific knockouts (Figure 3D).
Western blots showed a gradual decline of MTERF3 protein levels with time in hearts of the tissue-specific knockouts (Figure 3E).
Skeletal muscle had normal morphological appearance at age 16 weeks (not shown).
We have previously gener ated mice with tissue-specific respiratory chain dysfunc tion selectively in heart (Li et al., 2000), skeletal muscle (Wredenberg et al., 2002), or both of these tissues (Hans son et al., 2004; Wang et al., 1999) by conditional knock out of the gene encoding TFAM.
These previous studies have demonstrated a marked difference between tissues in their ability to tolerate mtDNA depletion, with much earlier onset of respiratory chain deficiency in heart than in skeletal muscle.
This discrepancy between the two tis sues likely explains why we observed no obvious pheno type in skeletal muscle of the Mterf3 knockouts at the end of their lives.
The cause of death in the Mterf3 tissue specific knockout mice was thus mitochondrial cardiomy opathy caused by the absence of MTERF3 protein in heart.

Loss of MTERF3 Causes Increased Steady-State Levels of mtDNA Transcripts The levels of mtDNA were normal in end-stage Mterf3 knockout hearts (Figures 4A and 4B).
We investigated the steady-state levels of mRNAs generated by transcrip tion from the light-strand promoter (LSP) and the heavy strand promoter (HSP) of mtDNA in Mterf3 knockout hearts at the ages of 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks (Figures 4C4E).
We found a general increase in levels of HSP transcribed mRNAs in heart, whereas the levels of ND6 transcripts, the only mRNA transcribed from LSP, were decreased in tissue-specific knockouts (Figures 4C4E).
Interestingly, the levels of mRNAs transcribed from HSP were more elevated in old knockouts in comparison with young knockouts (Figure 4E), mirroring the gradual de crease in the MTERF3 protein levels between the ages of 4 and 16 weeks (Figure 3E).
The mitochondrial rRNA genes are transcribed from HSP, and we found elevated steady-state levels of the 12S rRNA transcript in hearts from knockouts at all investigated ages (Figure 4E).
The levels of 16S rRNA were decreased, but the levels of RNA19, which encompass 16S rRNA and ND1, were increased (Figure 4E).
This indicates that impaired pro cessing of RNA 19 explains the observed decrease of 16S rRNA.
We also found increased levels of another pre cursor transcript containing ND5/Cyt b sequences (Fig ures 4D and 4E).
Next, we assessed steady-state levels of tRNAs in hearts of 16-weeks-old Mterf3 knockouts (Figure 5).
The steady-state levels of tRNAs transcribed from HSP were highly increased, with the exception of the most pro moter-distal tRNA gene (tRNAT; Figures 5A5C).
The levels of tRNAs transcribed from LSP were increased if the gene had a promoter-proximal location, and decreased if the Cell 130, 273285, July 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 277 gene had a promoter-distal location (Figure 5C).
The levels of two tRNAs were particularly low (tRNAC, 35%, and tRNAQ, 45% of levels in controls) and can be predicted to be insufficient to sustain normal mitochondrial protein synthesis (Hayashi et al., 1991).
We studied the assembly of respiratory chain com plexes by performing blue native polyacrylamide gel elec trophoresis (BN-PAGE) of mitochondria from control and Mterf3 knockout hearts at the ages of 4 and 16 weeks (Figure 6A).
There was a marked reduction in levels of assembled Complex I, III, IV, and V, all of which contain Figure 5.

The BN-PAGE analysis also revealed a partially assem bled ATP synthase subcomplex containing the a subunit.
Western blot analyses showed a progressive deterioration in steady-state levels of both mtDNA-and nucleus encoded respiratory chain subunits (Figure 6B), consistent with defective assembly of respiratory chain complexes.
Measurements of respiratory chain enzyme activities in Mterf3 knockout hearts confirmed the results from BN PAGE analyses and showed a progressive deterioration of Complex I, Complex IIII, and Complex IV enzyme ac tivities, whereas the Complex II enzyme activity was only slightly affected (Figure 6C).
The mitochondrial ATP pro duction rate (MAPR) in isolated mitochondria showed the same pattern of progressive impairment of respiratory chain function with time (Figure S3).
There was an increase of citrate synthase activity (Figure 6C), a marker of mito chondrial mass, consistent with the increased mitochon drial mass observed by quantifying electron micrographs of Mterf3 knockout hearts (Figure 3C).
MTERF3 Binds the mtDNA Promoter Regions and Represses Transcription Initiation The transcriptional responses caused by lack of MTERF3 prompted us to investigate whether the protein interacts with regulatory regions of mtDNA.
We established stable HeLa cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged human MTERF3 and purified this protein to homogeneity.
Edman degrada tion sequencing showed that the mitochondrial form of MTERF3 lacked amino acids 168 (Figure S4A), consis tent with the observed cleavage of the leader peptide after mitochondrial import (Figure 1C).
Next, we expressed and purified the mitochondrial form of MTERF3 in bacteria (Figure S4B) and analyzed its DNA binding activity.
Similar to MTERF1, MTERF3 displayed a strong non-sequence specific DNA binding activity with an apparent Kd of about 16 nM (Figures S4C and S4D).
However, using the electro phoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), we detected no se quence-specific binding of MTERF3 to a set of 32 DNA fragments covering the entire human mtDNA genome in the presence of competitor DNA (poly-dI-dC) (data not shown).
MTERF1 displayed sequence-specific binding to its recognition site using the same conditions (data not shown).
To further characterize MTERF3 interactions with mtDNA, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation proto col (ChIP) in combination with 29 primer pairs to screen the entire human mtDNA genome for MTERF3 interactions (Figure 7A).
The protocol was validated by using a poly clonal antiserum against human MTERF1, and as ex pected, we detected the previously known binding site in the tRNAL1 gene (Figure 7B).
A second MTERF1 binding site in the HSP promoter region has recently been identi fied (Martin et al., 2005).
However, our screening did not obtain any MTERF1 signal in this area under various ChIP assay conditions (data not shown).
Using a polyclonal an tiserum against human MTERF3, we found a distinct and Figure 6.

reproducible increase in signal in a region containing LSP and HSP (Figure 7C).
The baseline for binding of MTERF3 to all other mtDNA regions was flat and showed no addi tional peaks (Figure 7C).
The increase in MTERF3 signal is observed over a relatively broad area and may be ex plained by the existence of more than one interaction site in this region.
The increased levels of mtDNA tran scripts in Mterf3 knockouts and the binding of MTERF3 to the mtDNA promoters suggested that MTERF3 might affect transcription initiation.
We confirmed this prediction by assessing de novo transcription of mtDNA by adding radiolabeled UTP (Figure 7D) or biotinylated UTP (Fig ure 7E) to isolated mitochondria from control and Mterf3 knockout hearts.
The transcription initiation was in creased from both LSP and HSP in mitochondria lacking MTERF3 (Figure 7E).
The data presented above are consistent with a tran scription repression role of MTERF3, and to biochemically validate this function, we monitored in vitro transcription in MTERF3-depleted human mitochondrial extracts (Figures 7F and 7G).
Anti-MTERF3 antibodies depleted >90% of the MTERF3 protein, but did not affect the levels of an other mitochondrial transcription factor, TFAM (Figure 7F).
Depletion of MTERF3 increased transcription by 50% in comparison with undepleted extracts (Figure 7G).
Addi tion of recombinant MTERF3 did not restore transcription to wild-type levels, indicating that depletion of MTERF3 also leads to loss of additional factors required for MTERF3 function (data not shown).
The presented data are formally consistent with a role for MTERF3 as a promoter-proximal transcription termi nation factor.
To address this possibility, we employed Cell 130, 273285, July 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 279 Figure 7.

The rationale for this experiment is that transcription termination close to the promoters should generate short transcripts detect able by northern blot analyses.
As expected, we observed increased levels of promoter-proximal transcripts in the knockout mice, but there were no additional transcript isoforms in wild-type mice (Figures S5A, S5C, and S5D).
We also used S1 mapping to screen for the occurrence of promoter-proximal transcription termination events that would produce transcripts too short to be detected by northern blot analyses.
This analysis was only per formed on LSP transcripts.
We detected higher levels of LSP promoter-proximal transcripts, but the size distribu tion of transcription products remained unchanged (Figure S5B).
These findings argue against a role for MTERF3 in promoter-proximal transcription termination and support the interpretation that MTERF3 acts as a neg ative regulator of transcription initiation.
DISCUSSION We show here that MTERF3 is a mitochondrial protein that interacts with the mtDNA promoter region and decreases transcription initiation in mammalian mitochondria.
This negative regulation is likely important for fine-tuning mito chondrial transcription in response to physiological de mands.
Previous studies have identified ways of activating mtDNA expression, and this work shows a mechanism that is used for repression of mtDNA expression.
Besides a possible regulatory physiological role, such repression could also be important in ensuring that transcription from the opposing promoters, LSP and HSP, on the small mammalian mtDNA molecule does not result in interfer ence by collision of transcription complexes.
Recent stud ies of nuclear transcription in yeast have demonstrated that closely spaced promoters opposing each other have normal levels of transcription initiation, but the steady state levels of promoter-distal transcripts decrease be cause of transcription collision (Prescott and Proudfoot, 2002).
The yeast studies have also established that de creased transcription initiation at the forward promoter will increase the steady-state levels of promoter-distal transcripts transcribed from the reverse promoter and vice versa (Prescott and Proudfoot, 2002).
We found in creased transcription initiation at both LSP and HSP, but decreased levels of promoter-distal LSP transcripts in MTERF3-deficient mouse hearts.
The mtDNA transcrip tion pattern in MTERF3-deficient mitochondria is thus very similar to the nuclear transcription pattern generated from opposing promoters in yeast (Prescott and Proud foot, 2002), and it is thus possible that transcription colli sion is occurring in Mterf3 knockout mice.
Alternatively, the increased number of transcription initiation events may lead to a reduced availability of transcription factors, which, in turn, could affect the possibility of restarting stalled transcription and thereby reduce the levels of promoter-distal RNA molecules.
Our data thus suggest that aberrant transcription causes the decrease in oxidative phosphorylation capacity in Mterf3 knockouts and do not support the suggestion by others that MTERF3 is directly involved in regulating translation (Roberti et al., 2006).
We produced recombinant MTERF3 protein from differ ent sources and added it to the mtDNA in vitro transcription system.
However, we observed no effects after MTERF3 addition when studying in vitro transcription initiation and transcription patterns by using a variety of templates (data not shown).
It is therefore likely that the action of MTERF3 is dependent on additional mitochondrial pro teins besides the ones constituting the basal mitochondrial transcription machinery.
The mitochondrial transcription termination factor 1 (MTERF1, previously MTERF or MTERM) affects tran scription elongation by blocking transcription down stream of the mitochondrial rRNA genes (Fernandez-Silva et al., 1997; Kruse et al., 1989; Shang and Clayton, 1994).
This transcription termination action of MTERF1 has been reconstituted in a pure in vitro transcription system (Asin Cayuela et al., 2005) and is predicted to increase the ratio of rRNAs to the downstream mRNAs.
In addition, MTERF1 has been proposed to bind the HSP promoter (Martin et al., 2005).
We could verify the MTERF1 binding site in the tRNAL1 gene, but we observed no binding to the promoter region.
This discrepancy from previously pub lished results (Martin et al., 2005) could perhaps be explained by differences in protocols and sources of mitochondria for the ChIP analyses.
Further understand ing of MTERF1 function necessitates additional in vitro ex periments as well as genetic manipulation of the MTERF1 gene in vivo.
In MTERF3-deficient hearts, we found increased levels of an unprocessed transcript containing 16S rRNA/ND1 (RNA19) and another transcript containing ND5/Cyt b sequences.
Increased levels of RNA19 have been reported in patients harboring different pathogenic muta tions in tRNAL1, tRNAK, and mtDNA deletions (Bindoff et al., 1993; Heddi et al., 1993; Koga et al., 2003).
The finding of unprocessed precursor mtRNAs in MTERF3 deficient mitochondria may therefore be secondary to the respiratory-chain-deficient state or, alternatively, it may suggest an additional function for MTERF3 in RNA processing.
In conclusion, we report here that MTERF3 is an es sential protein whose in vivo function is to repress transcription initiation in mammalian mitochondria.
Repression of mtDNA transcription may be important in regulating oxidative phosphorylation in response to dif ferent physiological demands, and it may also provide a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription complexes generated by the opposing promoters.
The discovery of the transcription inhibition role of MTERF3 will open new possibilities in studying regulation of mtDNA transcription in physiological adaptation, disease, and aging.

Creation of Mterf3 Knockout Mice A targeting vector was engineered so that the exon 2 of Mterf3, which contains the translation start codon, was flanked by two loxP sites (Figure 2A).
A loxP site was introduced in the intron 50 to exon 2, whereas a Frt-PGK-neo-Frt cassette (Frt-site-flanked neomycin gene expressed from the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter) with an adja cent loxP site was introduced in the intron 30 to exon 2.
The targeting vector was constructed as follows: genomic clones containing the mouse Mterf3 were isolated from a 129/SvJl FixII phage library (Stra tagene).
A SphI fragment of 9.8 kb containing the Mterf3 was cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (pBS, Stratagene) to generate the plasmid pBST3.
The pST7 plasmid contains an Frt-PGK-neo-Frt cassette and a single adjacent loxP site (Trifunovic et al., 2004).
An additional BamHI site was introduced into this plasmid by ligating an oligonucle otide with a BamHI site into an XhoI site.
This alteration makes it pos sible to excise the Frt-PGK-neo-Frt cassette and loxP site by BamHI digestion.
This modified pST7 plasmid was digested with BamHI to excise a fragment containing the Frt-PGK-neo-Frt cassette and the flanking loxP site, which, in turn, was ligated into BamHI-digested pBST3 to generate pBST3neo.
Next, an oligonucleotide with a PacI site was inserted into the SacI site of pST7 to allow excision of the loxP site by PacI digestion.
The excised PacI fragment containing the loxP site was ligated to PacI-digested pBST3neo vector, thus cre ating the final knockout vector pBST3KO.
The pBST3KO vector was analyzed by restriction-enzyme mapping and partial DNA sequencing for verification.
The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and elec troporated into 129R1 ES cells.
A total of 156 ES cell clones were analyzed by Southern hybridization, and three specifically targeted clones were found.
Chimeras were generated by blastocyst injection of ES cells and germline transmission was obtained from two different clones.
The Frt-flanked PGK-neo gene was excised by mating Mterf3+/neo-loxP mice (Figure 2A) to transgenic mice ubiquitously ex pressing Flp-recombinase, thus generating Mterf3+/loxP mice (Fig ure 2A).
The Mterf3+/mice were generated by crossing Mterf3+/loxP mice to b-actin-cre mice ubiquitously expressing cre-recombinase.
Tissue-Specific Disruption of Mterf3 Generation of heart-and skeletal-muscle-specific Mterf3 knockout mice was carried out as previously described (Hansson et al., 2004).
Mterf3loxP/loxP mice were mated to heterozygous transgenic mice expressing cre-recombinase in heart and skeletal muscle (+/Ckmm cre).
Double heterozygous mice (Mterf3+/loxP, +/Ckmm-cre) were ob tained and crossed to Mterf3loxP/loxP mice to generate tissue-specific knockouts (Mterf3loxP/loxP, +/Ckmm-cre).
All crosses yielded offspring at the expected Mendelian proportions.
Creation of Mterf3 BAC Transgenic Mice A BAC clone containing Mterf3 was identified by Clone Finder in Na tional Center for Biotechnology Information database.
A 206 kb clone (RP23-63P12) with 95 kb and 67 kb flanking sequences upstream and downstream of Mterf3 was obtained from Childrens Hospital Oak land-BAC-PAC Resources.
We used BAC recombination technology (Lee et al., 2001) to alter the coding sequence of Mterf3 so that a syn onymous change was created to remove a PstI restriction enzyme site in exon 3 (Figure S1).
Transgenic lines were generated from the mod ified BAC clone by injection of cesium chloride-purified BAC DNA into pronuclear-stage embryos of the FVB/N strain.
Founders were identi fied by PstI-restriction enzyme analysis of a PCR product containing exon 3 of Mterf3.
Positive transgenic lines were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of PstI-digested tail DNA by using exon 3 of Mterf3 as probe.
282 Cell 130, 273285, July 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. Southern, Northern, and Western Blot Analyses and Antisera Isolation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and Southern blot, northern blot, western blot, and phosphoimager analyses were carried out as previ ously described (Ekstrand et al., 2004).
Polyclonal rabbit antisera to mouse COXII, ATP8 were used to detect mitochondria-encoded respi ratory chain subunits (Larsson et al., 1998).
Monoclonal mouse anti bodies detecting nucleus-encoded subunits of mouse Complex I (NDUFA9 subunit), Complex II (SDHA subunit), Complex III (UQCRC2 subunit), Complex IV (COX4 subunit), and Complex V (ATP5A1 subunit) were obtained from Molecular Probes.
Pure human recombinant MTERF3 protein and two synthetic peptides of mouse MTERF3 DLSKIEKHPDAANC (amino acids 160172) and CGRAQYDPAKPN (amino acids 368378) were used as antigens to immunize rabbits to obtain polyclonal antisera (Agrisera AB).
Isotope-labeled oligonulceotides were used to detect promoter proximal transcripts from LSP (50-TCAAACCCTATGTCCTGATC-30), HSP1 (50-CATTTTCAGTGCTTTGCTTTGTTATTA-30 ), and HSP2 (50-TA ATTATAAGGCCAGGACCAAA-30).
The nuclease S1 protection assay was performed as previously described (Martin et al., 2005) using RNA isolated from purified mitochondria and an isotope-labeled oligo nucleotide probe (50-GACATATAATATTAACTATCAAACCCTATGTCC TGATCAATTCTAGTAGT-30 ).
In Vitro Transcription Transcription competent S-100 mitochondrial lysate was prepared from a 3 liter culture of S3 HeLa cells grown to a density of 1.5 3 106 cells/ml in D-MEM medium (DMEM+Glutamax, Gibco, supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin) following a previously described procedure (Micol et al., 1996).
For immunodepletion, 20 ml of anti-MTERF3 in PBS was incubated together with 100 ml lysate and protein A-agarose overnight at 4C.
The mixture was passed over a Poly-Prep chromatography col umn (Bio-Rad, CA) and the cleared flow-through was used for immu noblot analysis and in vitro transcription.
Control lysate was treated the same way, but anti-MTERF3 was replaced by PBS.
In vitro tran scription was performed as described in supplementary material.
Biochemistry and BN-PAGE Mitochondria were isolated from left ventricle heart tissue of control (Mterf3loxP/loxP, n = 35) and knockout (Mterf3loxP/loxP; +/Ckmm-cre, n = 35) mice at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age, and the respiratory chain enzyme activities and the MAPR were measured blindly as described (Wibom et al., 2002).
BN-PAGE was performed on heart mitochondria from control (Mter f3loxP/loxP) and tissue-specific knockout (Mterf3loxP/loxP; +/Ckmm-cre) mice at 4 and 16 weeks of age.
Heart homogenates were prepared in 150 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), and centri fuged twice for 10 min at 600 3 g to obtain a postnuclear supernatant.
Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 3 g and resuspended in homogenization buffer supplemented with the Mini-protean protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method.
Mitochondria were resus pended in 1.75 M aminocaproic acid, 75 mM BisTris (pH 7.0), and 2 mM EDTA to a final protein concentration of 13 mg/ml.
Resuspended mitochondria were solubilized with 1% lauryl maltoside for 15 min on ice and then centrifugued at 20,000 3 g for 20 min.
Supernatants con sisting of 30 mg of solubilized protein were loaded in 5%15% poly acrylamide gradient gels for BN-PAGE (Schagger and von Jagow, 1991).
Proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences).
Western blotting was performed using antibodies (Molecular Probes) against Complex I (NDUFA9 sub unit), Complex II (SDHA subunit), Complex III (UQCRC2 subunit), Com plex IV (COX4 subunit), and Complex V (ATP5A1 subunit).
Peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies.
The signal was detected by using ECL plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences).
MTERF3 Protein Purification and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays The cDNA encoding full-length human MTERF3 with a FLAG-tag at its carboxy terminus was cloned into pTRE-Tight (Clontech) to obtain the pTRE-FLAGT3 vector.
HeLa TetOn cells (Clontech) were stably co transfected with pTRE-FLAGT3 and a linear hygromycin resistance marker following the manufacturers instructions.
Cells were grown in monolayer in D-MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% streptomycin, 1% penicillin, and 200 ug/ml hygromycin.
Expression of hMTERF3-FLAG was induced by addition of 1 ug/ml doxycycline to the incubation medium, and cells were harvested after 48 hr of induction.
Approximately 4 3 108 HeLa cells were harvested and homogenized using a Dounce Homogenizer.
hMTERF3-FLAG protein was purified from mitochondria isolated by differential centrifu gation using ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) according to the man ufacturers manual.
Automated chemical (Edman) protein sequenc ing was done using a Procise 494 instrument from Applied Biosystems (AB) as described (Tempst et al., 1994).
Stepwise liberated PTH-amino acids were identified using an on-line HPLC system (AB) equipped with a PTH C18 (2.1 3 220 mm; 5 mm particle size) column (AB).
The mature form of MTERF3 lacking amino acids 168 was ex pressed in bacteria with a C-terminal 63His-tag.
The protein was pu rified to near homogeneity over Ni2+-Agarose, Hi-Trap Heparin, and Mono Q (GE Healthcare).
The dsDNA binding capacity of mature MTERF3 was first assayed by an EMSA using 32 different double stranded probes of about 550 bp each covering the entire mtDNA sequence.
A short 20 bp DNA fragment from the D-loop region (50 CCACCATCCTCCGTGAAATC-30) was chosen to analyze the nonspe cific DNA interaction further.
We labeled the DNA fragment in the 50 end by using [g-32P] ATP.
Reactions were carried out in 20 ml volumes containing 10 fmol DNA template, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and the protein concentrations indicated in the figure legend.
Reac tions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before separation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 X TBE buffer for 65 min at 150V.
The gels were exposed fresh to a Phosphorimager screen and scanned with a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).
Quantification was carried out with Quantity One 4.6 software (Bio-Rad).
The apparent Kd was calculated as described elsewhere (Carey, 1991).
Identical data was obtained with recombinant MTERF3 carrying an N-terminal 63His-tag (data not shown).
ChIP Analysis HeLa cells grown in 15 3 175 cm tissue culture flasks to 80% conflu ence were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.
The crosslinking reaction was quenched by add ing 125 mM glycine and then incubated for 5 additional minutes.
After washing the cells twice in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed and mito chondria were purified by differential centrifugation.
Mitochondria were lysed as described (Micol et al., 1996) in 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% tween-20, 0.15 M KCl, 1 mM phenylmethlsulfonylfluoride, 2 mM pepstatin A, 0.6 mM leupeptin, and 2 mM benzamidine.
The mitochondrial lysate was sonicated on ice in a Bioruptor UCD 200TM (Diagenode) for 10 min at high output, with intervals of 30 s on and 30 s off, and centri fuged for 10 min at 16,000 3 g. Three 100 ml aliquots of supernatant were used for each immunoprecipitation experiment.
The first sample (antibody sample) was incubated with 10 ml of human MTERF3 poly clonal antibody for 2 hr in a rotary shaker at 4C.
The second sample (bead sample) was incubated in the same way with 10 ml antiserum solvent (50% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3) without antibody, while the third sample (input sample) was not subjected to immunoprecipitation and kept on ice until the crosslinking reversal step.
We added 100 ml of 50% protein A beads (Sigma) to the lysis buffer of the antibody sam ple and the bead sample and incubated both in a rotary shaker for 1 hr at 4C.
Next, the antibody sample and the bead sample were transferred to Ultrafree-MC filters (Millipore) and washed twice in wash buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 M NaCl) and twice in deoxycholate buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.25 M LiCl).
The antibody sample and the bead sample were rinsed in 10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and the crosslinked DNA-protein complexes were eluted by incubation at 65C for 15 min with 100 ml elution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [pH 8.0]).
At this stage, we added 200 ml elution buffer to the input sample and the protein/DNA crosslink was reverted by incubating all three samples overnight at 65C.
Pro teins were removed by incubating with 20 mg proteinase K for 2 hr at 56C.
DNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalco hol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform and precipitated overnight at 20C with 2.5 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl and 20 mg glycogen.
Quantitative PCR was carried out on a LightCycler 2.0 Instrument (Roche) using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit.
The PCR reactions were carried out according to the manufacturers instructions.
The primer pairs used for ChIP are listed in Table S1 in the Supplemental Data (available with this article online).
For each pair of primers, a calibration curve was calculated with five standards of known concentrations of human mtDNA (1.4 nM, 0.14 nM, 14 fM, 1.4 fM, and 0.14 fM).
The crossing point was cal culated for each sample and interpolated with the calibration curve to obtain the DNA concentration.
Results were expressed as the ratio be tween the concentration of DNA calculated for the antibody sample and that calculated for the bead sample (signal/noise ratio).
In Organello Transcription Assay De novo transcription was measured in isolated mitochondria as de scribed previously (Enriquez et al., 1996).
The mitochondrial fraction was suspended in transcription buffer containing 25 mM sucrose, 75 mM sorbitol, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM K2HPO4, 50 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ADP, 10 mM glutamate, 2.5 mM malate, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), with 1 mg of BSA per ml.
Mitochondria containing a total of 200 mg protein were incubated in 300 ml of the transcription buffer containing 10 mCi of a32P-UTP (Amersham Biosciences) at 37C for 30 min.
After the incubation, the mitochondria were pelleted and washed with PBS.
The mitochondria were then solubilized in 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 20 mg of protease K (Gibco), and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min.
The mitochondrial RNA was isolated by phenol extraction.
Mitochondrial RNA was la beled with biotin by using 2 ml of 10 mM Bio-11-UTP (Ambion) and using the same procedure.
