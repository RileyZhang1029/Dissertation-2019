Observations of Currents in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron Michael J. McCormick and David J. Schwab   NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory 2205 Commonwealth Blvd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA   Corresponding author: michael.mccormick@noaa.gov During June 1991 through June 1994, six current meter moorings were deployed in the outer region of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron to study the bay s dynamics and interaction with Lake Huron. Two current meters were conﬁgured on each subsurface mooring at 14 m below the water surface and 2 m above the bottom, and current speed, direction, and water temperature were recorded at 15 minute intervals.
These data represent nearly 1.2 million observations and are the longest continuous set of observations conducted anywhere in Lake Huron and the ﬁrst extensive set of winter observations conducted in Saginaw Bay.
The winter months showed the highest mean currents from the moorings closest to Lake Huron, whereas the stratiﬁed season showed high mean currents at the moorings located in the bay proper.
There was little consistency in mean ﬂow vectors other than the bottom currents at the southeastern mooring which showed consistent ﬂow from the bay into Lake Huron. Only a small fraction of the kinetic energy was contained in the mean ﬂow. The variability in the orientation of the principal axes of variation on semi-annual to inter-annual time scales suggests using caution in generalizing about circulation patterns based solely upon limited data sets.
Keywords: physical limnology, mean ﬂow, statistics Introduction Saginaw Bay is a large embayment on the western side of Lake Huron encompassing approximately 2,960 km2. The Charity Islands near the middle of the bay roughly mark the boundary separating the inner from the outer bay (Fig. 1). The inner bay is characterized by shallow water depths (average depth 4.5 m) except for a channel running nearly parallel to the main axis of the bay with a maximum depth of 14 m. In contrast, the outer bay (average depth 16 m) deepens from the islands to nearly 40 m where the bay merges into Lake Huron. There have been few studies of the circulation within the bay, and most of those have been qual- itative (Harrington, 1895 Johnson, 1958 Beeton et al., 1967), with Danek and Saylor (1977) provid- ing more quantitative estimates of circulation from ﬁeld measurements in 1974.
Those ﬁeld experiments involved drifting buoys and several ﬁxed current me- ter moorings.
However, the ﬁeld experiments were conducted for a relatively brief time period (May October), and no winter observations were made.
This study reports on the results of six ﬁxed cur- rent meter moorings with data recorded continu- ously over a three-year period from 1991 to 1994.
This research was part of a larger effort focused on establishing the pre-zebra mussel conditions of Saginaw Bay.
Our objectives were to describe the general statistics of the observed currents and their inter-annual variability.
Methods and results Six current meter moorings were deployed from June 1991 through June 1994.
Four of the moorings span the 42 km wide mouth of the bay, with the other two located nearer to the islands (Fig. 1). All Aquatic Ecosystem Health & Management, 11(2):182 189, 2008.

Mooring locations in Saginaw Bay from June 1991 through June 1994. moorings were deployed in the outer region of the bay near the sites occupied by the Danek and Say- lor (1977) study.
No moorings were deployed in the inner bay because of the shallow water depths re- stricting our ability to make year-round observations using subsurface moorings.
The moorings were ser- viced each successive June beginning in 1992 with the old current meters replaced with refurbished equipment.
The Vector Averaging Current Meters (VACM) were equipped with a savonius rotor, com- pass vane, and a thermistor. The VACM recorded speed, direction (+ 3 ), and temperature (+  0.1 C) every 15 minutes onto a magnetic tape.
Each mooring consisted of two VACMs, a bottom weight, and a subsurface ﬂoat with adequate buoyancy to maintain a taut line mooring.
The top VACM was maintained at a depth of approximately 14 m be- low the water surface, and the bottom VACM was located at 2 m above the bottom.
The use of a sub- surface ﬂoat minimized any ice concerns and any potential damage from passing ships.
A total of 36 VACMs were deployed from 18 June 1991 through 14 June 1994 representing about 1.2 million observations of current and temperature.
Six of the VACMs malfunctioned for a variety of rea- sons ranging from total failure to record any data, to high frequency, rapid oscillations in current speed rendering all data for that meter suspect and not used in any subsequent analyses.
Speciﬁc details of the deployments and the instruments used in these anal- yses are shown in Table 1.
All data were decomposed from speed and direction to velocity components (u,v), with u being positive to the east and v being positive to the north.
The data were then averaged to form hourly records.
Also, the year was divided in half to more clearly separate the baroclinic from the barotropic response to wind stress under strati- ﬁed and non-stratiﬁed conditions.
The stratiﬁed sea- son was deﬁned from 11 May through 10 November (DOY 131 314), and the remaining part of the year was deﬁned as the non-stratiﬁed season.
Not all days within either period meet the deﬁnition of stratiﬁed  184 McCormick et al.  Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management 11 (2008) 182 189 Table 1.

The basic statistics of these data are seen in Table 2.
One technique to graphically display and efﬁciently illustrate the characteristics of the data is to locate the preferred axis of variation.
The major axis is rotated to be in alignment with the greatest variability of the observations accord- ing to the following equation (Emery and Thomson, 2001). (cid:4) (cid:4) , v Where θ pis the angle of the principal axis measured clockwise from north, and u are the ﬂuctuat- ing velocity components obtained by subtracting the respective component mean from the observations.
The minor axis is perpendicular to the major axis.
The variances associated with the principal axes are equal to the eigenvalues calculated from formaliz- ing the two-dimensional scatter plot as an eigenvalue problem.
The solution is given as: θ p = 0.5 tan  1 + 90 (1) (cid:2) (cid:1) 2u(cid:4)v(cid:4) u(cid:4)2  v(cid:4)2 (cid:3) (cid:4) λ1 λ2 = 0.5 (u(cid:4)2 + v(cid:4)2)  ((u(cid:4)2  v(cid:4)2)2 + 4(u(cid:4)v(cid:4))2)1/2  (2)  McCormick et al.

Additional details and derivations of these equations can be found in Emery and Thomson (2001). Figures 2 5 show the principal axes of variation for the top (14 m below the water surface) and bot- tom (2 m above the bottom) current meters calcu- lated according to equation 1 for both the stratiﬁed and non-stratiﬁed periods for all years.

Discussion Each mooring location had at least one occasion 1 of a mean current greater than or equal to 2 cm s (Table 2). There were nine such occurrences from June 94 with the peak means occur- 91 to June (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) 91 and ring during the non-stratiﬁed season at the outer four moorings, whereas peak means occurred at stations 5 and 6 during the stratiﬁed period.
There was only one occurrence of a peak mean current at a bottom current meter (mooring 4), and the remaining eight peaks all occurred at the top current meter.
There was signiﬁcant directional variability to the mean ﬂows, with the greatest inter-annual variability oc- curring at mooring 1 during the stratiﬁed period (Fig. 92 the mean surface ﬂow at station 1 2). In was directed out of the bay, whereas in 93 the mean ﬂow was directed into the bay.
In fact, variability in the magnitude and direction of the mean ﬂow ﬁeld was often signiﬁcantly different between years, be- tween the top and the bottom current meter, and be- tween the stratiﬁed and non-stratiﬁed seasons, with the most consistent site being the bottom current me- ter at station 4 which consistently showed the mean ﬂow to be directed out of the bay.
The importance of the mean ﬂow relative to current variability (%V, Table 2) was calculated by squaring the mean ﬂow, S, dividing it by λ1 + λ2, and multiplying the result by 100.

McCormick et al.  Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management 11 (2008) 182 189 189 mean ﬂow ranged from (1 13%) and (1 20%) for the stratiﬁed and non-stratiﬁed seasons, respectively.
The overall mean during stratiﬁcation was 3%, in- creasing to 6% during the non-stratiﬁed portion of the year.
Although the mean ﬂows are small in terms of their contribution to instantaneous circulation pat- tern, their very existence indicates that there is a sig- niﬁcant net exchange of water between the bay and lake.
(cid:4) (cid:4) 92  The principal axes of variation (Figs. 2 5) provide information on preferred ﬂow orientation by the alignment of the major axis parallel to the direction showing the greatest variance or energy of the current meter data under examination.
The top 12 data sets in terms of mean kinetic energy (KEu+ KEv  25 cm2 s 2, Table 2) all occur at the top current meter and 11 of them happen within the stratiﬁed season.
Each mooring location had at least one season with high kinetic energy except for station 2 which in 93 had mean high kinetic 2 for the stratiﬁed energies of 30 and 29 cm2 s and non-stratiﬁed periods, respectively.
The energy levels were nearly equal between seasons, yet the energy was more evenly distributed during strati- ﬁcation with 56% of the total variance contained in λ1, as opposed to the non-stratiﬁed season when 76% of the total variance was aligned along the major axis.
The distribution of variance between the major and minor axes for the top 12 most energetic records ranged from 56 to 85% with an overall mean of 73% demonstrating anisotropy in the ﬂow ﬁeld but not necessarily a preferred orientation to the ﬂow. If there were a preferred ﬂow orientation, as is likely with bathymetric steering of currents, then the principal axes of variation should be time invariable.
For example, in general, the 94 current meter data show a cyclonic rotation of the principal axes compared to the previous two years, suggesting a similar rotation in the wind stress pattern which should be discernible in the over-lake meteorology.
(cid:4) 93  (cid:4) Conclusions The following four points summarize our major ﬁndings. (1) The winter months showed the highest mean currents at the outermost bay stations, whereas the stratiﬁed season showed high mean currents fur- ther into the bay, in more shallow waters, at stations 5 and 6.
(2) The bottom currents at station 4 were the most consistent over time showing a mean ﬂow directed out of the bay into Lake Huron. (3) Only a small fraction of the kinetic energy was contained in the mean currents.
And, ﬁnally, (4) the variability in the orientation of the principal axes on semi-annual to inter-annual time scales suggests caution in gen- eralizing about circulation based solely upon limited data sets.
Future efforts will be directed at more ex- tensive comparisons between these data and output from whole-lake hydrodynamic model simulations, as well as examining the coupling of the surface meteorology driving the system.
