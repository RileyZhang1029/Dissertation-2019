Distinctive chromatin in human sperm
packages genes for embryo development

Saher Sue Hammoud1,2, David A. Nix3, Haiying Zhang1, Jahnvi Purwar1, Douglas T. Carrell2 & Bradley R. Cairns1

Because nucleosomes are widely replaced by protamine in mature human sperm, the epigenetic contributions of sperm
chromatin to embryo development have been considered highly limited. Here we show that the retained nucleosomes are
significantly enriched at loci of developmental importance, including imprinted gene clusters, microRNA clusters, HOX gene
clusters, and the promoters of stand-alone developmental transcription and signalling factors. Notably, histone
modifications localize to particular developmental loci. Dimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) is enriched at
certain developmental promoters, whereas large blocks of H3K4me3 localize to a subset of developmental promoters,
regions in HOX clusters, certain noncoding RNAs, and generally to paternally expressed imprinted loci, but not paternally
repressed loci. Notably, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) is significantly enriched at developmental promoters that are
repressed in early embryos, including many bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) promoters in embryonic stem cells.
Furthermore, developmental promoters are generally DNA hypomethylated in sperm, but acquire methylation during
differentiation. Taken together, epigenetic marking in sperm is extensive, and correlated with developmental regulators.

During spermiogenesis canonical histones are largely exchanged for
protamines1,2, small basic proteins that form tightly packed DNA
structures important for normal sperm function3. We find about
4% of the haploid genome retained in nucleosomes (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1a). The rare retained nucleosomes in sperm consist of either
canonical or histone variant proteins, including a testes-specific his-
tone H2B (TH2B) with an unknown specialized function4,5. Their
presence may simply be due to inefficient protamine replacement,
leading to a low random distribution genome-wide with no impact in
the embryo. Alternatively, these retained nucleosomes, along with
attendant modifications, might be enriched at particular genes/loci.
This latter possibility would raise the possibility for programmatic
retention for an epigenetic function in the embryo. To address these
questions, we localized the nucleosomes retained in mature sperm
from fertile donors using high-resolution genomic approaches.

Developmental loci bear nucleosomes
To address donor variability, we examined nucleosome retention in a
single donor (D1) and/or a pool of four donors (donor pool). Sperm
chromatin was separated into protamine-bound and histone-bound
fractions. In brief, mononucleosomes were isolated (.95% yield) by
sequential MNase digestion and sedimentation (Supplementary
Fig. 1b–e). This mononucleosome pool was used for chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP; to select modified nucleosomes), or
the DNA was isolated from the mononucleosome pool to represent
all nucleosomes. Purified DNA was subjected to high-throughput
sequencing (Illumina GAII), or alternatively, was labelled and hybri-
dized to a high-density promoter-tiling array (9 kilobase (kb) tiled;
Supplementary Fig. 2, schematic).

Our initial array approach examined three replicas of D1 (pairwise
average R2 5 0.85). Notably, Gene Ontology analysis revealed nucleo-
somes significantly enriched at promoters that guide embryonic
development—primarily developmental
transcription factors and
signalling molecules (Gene Ontology term false discovery rate

(FDR) , 0.01; Box 1 and Supplementary Table 1; for all extended
Gene Ontology categories see Supplementary Tables and Supplemen-
tary Data Set 1). To conduct genome-wide profiling, we performed high-
throughput sequencing of nucleosomes from D1 or the donor pool.
Regions significantly enriched for histone relative to the input control
(sheared total sperm DNA) were identified using a 300-base-pair (bp)
window metric6. For display, we depict the normalized difference score
and FDR window scores (Fig. 1a, FDR transformation (210 log10 (q-
value FDR)), 20 5 0.01, 25 5 0.003, 30 5 0.001, and 40 5 0.0001).
Histone-enriched loci for one individual (D1) were well correlated with
a donor pool (r 5 0.7). Globally, 76% of the top 9,841 histone-enriched
regions (FDR 40 cutoff) intersect genic regions, whereas the expected
intersection given random distribution is 36% (P , 0.001).

Interestingly, sequencing of D1 or the donor pool revealed signifi-
cant (FDR , 0.001) histone retention at many loci important for
embryo development, including embryonic transcription factors and
signalling pathway components (Box 1, Supplementary Tables 2
and 3). We show this enrichment at HOX loci (Fig. 1, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3), but also observe this at stand-alone developmental tran-
scription factors (Supplementary Fig. 4) and signalling factors
(Supplementary Fig. 5). An FDR of 60 yields 4,556 genes, of which
1,683 are grouped with developmental Gene Ontology categories
(2,848 total developmental genes). The magnitude of nucleosome
enrichment at developmental loci is modest, with high significance
provided by a moderate average increase at a large number of loci.
Histones are also significantly enriched at
the promoters of
microRNAs (miRNAs) (P , 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 6) and at the
class of imprinted genes (P , 0.0001; Fig. 2), addressed in detail later.
Selected loci were tested and confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR;
Supplementary Fig. 7a–e). Outside of these enriched regions, we
observe sequencing reads at low levels distributed genome-wide (for
example, Figs 1a and 2a), an observation consistent with low levels
of nucleosomes genome-wide, although contributions from non-
nucleosomal contamination cannot be ruled out.

Protamine occupancy (two replicas, R2 5 0.89, arrays only) yielded
7,151 enriched regions (.2.5-fold), but failed to identify any enriched
Gene Ontology term categories, although a few segments of the Y
chromosome were notably enriched (including the testis-specific
TSPY genes, data not shown). Regions of histone enrichment did
not exclude protamine, consistent with a nucleosome-protamine
mixture existing even at histone-enriched loci. However, as protamine
fragments averaged ,750 bp, protamine depletion would have to be
extensive (regions .2 kb) to be apparent on our arrays. Taken
together, nucleosomes are significantly enriched in sperm at genes
important for embryonic development, with transcription factors
the most enriched class.

Localization of modified nucleosomes
Because histones replace protamines genome-wide at fertilization7,8,
unmodified histones retained in sperm would seem insufficient to
influence gene regulation in embryos. Therefore, we examined three
further chromatin properties in sperm: (1) histone variants, (2)
histone modifications, and (3) DNA methylation. ChIP combined
with promoter microarray analysis (termed ChIP-chip) of TH2B
(two replicas, R2 5 0.93) shows 0.3% of gene promoters with rela-
tively high levels of TH2B (.twofold enrichment). Gene Ontology
analysis showed significant (FDR , 0.06) enrichment at genes

(Supplementary Table 4), but not at developmental categories.
ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with H2A.Z nucleosomes (at
standard conditions, 150–250 mM salt) did not show significant
enriched Gene Ontology categories, with high enrichment limited
to pericentric heterochromatin (Supplementary Fig. 8), consistent
with prior immunostaining9.

Modified nucleosomes were localized by performing ChIP on
mononucleosomes, followed by either array analysis or sequencing
(Supplementary Fig. 2, schematic). We normalized the data set for
each modification to the data set derived from input mononucleo-
somes, determined enriched regions (array .twofold; sequencing
FDR 40), found the nearest neighbouring gene, and performed
Gene Ontology analysis. In somatic cells, H3K4me2 is correlated with
euchromatic regions. In sperm, H3K4me2 was enriched at many
promoters, and at significant levels at promoters for developmental
transcription factors (two replicas R2 5 0.94; Gene Ontology term
FDR , 0.06; Box 1 and Supplementary Table 5). In somatic cells,
H3K4me3 is localized to: (1) the transcription start sites (TSS) of
active genes, (2) genes bearing ‘poised’ RNA polymerase II (Pol II),
and (3) the proximal promoter of inactive developmental regulators
in embryonic stem (ES) cells—promoters that also bear the silencing
mark H3K27me3 (refs 10, 11), and thus termed bivalent. Mature
sperm are transcriptionally inert, and Pol II protein levels are barely
detectable (data not shown), so the high H3K4me3 levels we observed
in sperm chromatin (Supplementary Fig. 1f) seemed surprising.
H3K4me3 was
localized by both ChIP-chip (three replicas,
R2 5 0.96) and ChIP-seq. The raw data sets were similar (r 5 0.7)
and the thresholded data sets were very similar (array twofold;
sequencing, FDR 40; 96% intersection, P , 0.001). With both data
sets, simple inspection showed small peaks at many 59 gene ends, with
high levels and broader blocks at a subset of genes (that is, HOX loci;
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Gene Ontology term analyses with
either data set yielded genes that are important for changing nuclear
architecture, RNA metabolism, spermatogenesis, and also selected
transcription factors
embryonic development
(FDR , 0.01, Box 1, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9). H3K4me3 at genes related to nuclear architecture and
spermatogenesis can presumably be attributed to their prior activa-
tion during gametogenesis. RNA metabolism occurs both in game-
togenesis and the early embryo, so attribution to a prior program as
opposed to a potential poising for a future program cannot be
unambiguously attributed. However, several
transcription and
signalling factors of importance in embryo development exhibited
high levels and a broad distribution of H3K4me3, including EVX1/2,
ID1, STAT3, KLF5, FGF9, SOX7/9, certain HOX genes, and certain
noncoding RNAs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs 3 and 6).

Interestingly, ChIP-seq analysis showed significant

levels of
H3K27me3 at developmental promoters in sperm (Box 1, Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4), and over-
lapped significantly with H3K27me3-occupied genes in ES cells
(P , 0.01), which are silent before differentiation. Furthermore,
bivalent genes (bearing H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in ES cells had
a significant overlap with bivalent genes in sperm (FDR , 0.001 for
each mark). Of the 1,999 genes identified as bivalent in ES cells, 861
were bivalent in sperm (P , 0.01; Supplementary Table 9). Also
notable but not explored further were many blocks of high
H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 in regions lacking annotation (Fig. 1a,
oval). Furthermore, H3K9me3 was not detected at the small set
developmental promoters tested, but was high at pericentric regions
(qPCR only, Supplementary Fig. 7d). Taken together, our results
demonstrate extensive histone modification patterns in sperm, and
significant similarities to patterns observed in ES cells.

and promoter arrays (individual replicates average D2 R2 5 0.97 and
D4 R2 5 0.89). Their methylation patterns were highly similar (pair-
wise R2 5 0.86), and extensive qPCR validated our array threshold
(Supplementary Fig. 7e). Gene Ontology analysis of genes with pro-
nounced DNA hypomethylation yielded transcription and signalling
factors that guide embryo development (FDR , 0.05; Box 1 and
Supplementary Table 10) including HOX loci (Fig. 3, blue bars,
and Supplementary Figs 4 and 10). Hypomethylation also overlapped
(P , 0.02;
very significantly with histone-enriched promoters
Supplementary Table 11). Bisulphite sequencing verified the
MeDIP results, revealing extensive hypomethylation at develop-
mental promoters in sperm (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Notably, DNA-hypomethylated promoters in mature sperm over-
lap greatly with developmental promoters bound by the self-renewal
network of transcription factors in human ES cells (for example,
OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and
FOXD3 proteins12; intersection of OCT4 protein occupancy and
DNA hypomethylation, P , 0.01). In ES cells, these proteins pro-
mote self-renewal and also work with repressive polycomb com-
plexes (PRC2; containing core component SUZ12) to help repress
a large set of developmental regulators (including HOX genes) to
prevent differentiation10,13–20. However, the hypomethylation of
developmental genes in sperm is extensive (Fig. 3 and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). In fact, when CpG islands are omitted from the data sets,
Gene Ontology term analysis of hypomethylated promoters still
yields developmental genes (Box 1 and Supplementary Table 12).
Notably, many of these developmental genes become methylated
after differentiation; differential analysis of sperm and primary
human fibroblasts (MeDIP, two replicas R2 5 0.86) showed that
many promoters occupied by PRC2 in human ES cells acquire
methylation in fibroblasts (FDR , 0.01, Supplementary Tables 13
and 14; HOXD illustrated in Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).
Furthermore, the promoters driving several key members of the self-
renewal network are themselves markedly hypermethylated in sperm

Attributes of HOX clusters and miRNAs
Nucleosome enrichment was clear across HOX loci and proximal
flanking regions, but falls off precipitously outside (HOXD, Fig. 1a;
HOXA, Supplementary Fig. 3a). Histone-enriched HOXD regions
with a single donor (D1) were largely shared with the donor pool
(Fig. 1a; D1 versus donor pool, r 5 0.7). Notably, retained nucleo-
somes have regional covalent modifications. For example, distinct
and very large (5–20 kb) blocks of H3K4me3 are clearly observed at
all HOX loci, and also at certain imprinted genes (addressed later). At
HOXD, high H3K4me3 extends for ,20 kb, encompassing all of
EVX2 and extending to the 39 region of HOXD13 (Fig. 1b).
Remarkably, a similar profile is observed at the related HOXA locus
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). At HOXD a second block of H3K4me3 is
observed in the region between HOXD4 and HOXD8 (Fig. 1b), a
region that encodes several noncoding RNAs expressed during
development. This region represents a marked difference from the
chromatin status in ES cells; in ES cells HOXD8–D11 are all bivalent.
The distribution of H3K4me2 (determined from two replicas of D1)
is clearly different from H3K4me3 at HOX loci (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 3). For example, at HOXD, H3K4me2 is enriched
in HOXD8–D11, a region deficient in H3K4me3 (Fig. 1b). Notably,
high H3K27me3 encompasses all HOX loci and their proximal
flanking regions. In contrast, high levels of H3K9me (a mark of
heterochromatin; Supplementary Fig. 7d) or H2A.Z were not
detected at the HOX loci tested.

Histones are enriched at many miRNAs, especially miRNA clusters
(Supplementary Fig. 6). For example, 16 of the 29 miRNA clusters on
autosomes were significantly enriched (P , 0.05). Clusters include
those bearing let7e, mir-17, mir-15a, mir-96, mir-135b and mir-10a/

hypomethylated (Supplementary Fig. 10d). Furthermore, 7 of the
12 miRNAs on autosomes that are occupied by OCT4, NANOG
and SOX2 in human ES cells17 are also significantly occupied by his-
tone (from pooled sequencing data). However, we do not at present
understand the logic for their modification status; certain miRNA
clusters have high histone and bivalent status, whereas others lack
either modification (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Attributes of primary and secondary imprinted genes
Nucleosomes are significantly enriched at most imprinted genes in
sperm, but at both paternally and maternally expressed loci. However,
we observe marked specificity of H3K4me3 localization, with high and
broad levels present at genes and noncoding RNAs that are paternally
expressed. Locus 11p15.5 (Fig. 2a) is a large imprinted cluster with
IGF2, H19 and KCNQ1 and several miRNAs. Here, increased levels of
histone are present throughout the imprinted region (up to OSBPL5),
but not in the large adjacent region lacking imprinted genes (Fig. 2a).
Notably, the paternally silenced H19 locus upstream of KCNQ1 has a
methylated DMR (Supplementary Fig. 10a) that lacks H3K4me3
(Fig. 2b). In contrast, MEST (a paternally expressed gene) has high
H3K4me3 that extends from its promoter and first exon (containing
the demethylated differentially methylated region (DMR); Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 10a) through the second exon. The antisense non-
coding RNA MESTIT1 (also paternally expressed) is transcribed from
the first intron, and is also very high in H3K4me3 (Fig. 2c).
Furthermore, the promoter region of the paternally expressed anti-
sense noncoding RNA KCNQ1OT1 displays H3K4me3 (Fig. 2a and
data not shown), and the DMR is DNA demethylated (Supplementary
Fig. 10a). Several other examples of paternally expressed loci with
blocks of H3K4me3 are provided in Supplementary Fig. 11, including
PEG3, the noncoding RNAs AIRN (antisense to IGF2R) and GNASAS
(antisense to GNAS). In contrast, genes flanking KCNQ1 that are
repressed by the noncoding RNA KCNQOT1 (such as OSBPL5,
TSSC4 and CD81; Fig. 2a, expanded in Supplementary Fig. 11) contain
histone, but lack H3K4me3. Notably, several paternally silenced genes
(bearing DNA methylation) bore moderate (2–3-fold) enrichment of
H3K9me3, a mark absent at paternally expressed genes (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7d).

The 14q32.33 region (DLK-DIO3) is complex and interesting;
paternally expressed genes such as DLK1 and RTL1 have moderate
levels of H3K4me3 in their promoters, and the imprinting control
locus (IG-DMR) lacks H3K4me3 (Fig. 2d) and is DNA methy-
lated26–28. Notably, the promoter of MEG3 (also known as GTL2; just
downstream of the IG-DMR) lacks DNA methylation in sperm, but
acquires DNA methylation in the embryo26–28, termed secondary
imprinting. Notably, the MEG3 promoter region that later acquires
DNA methylation initially bears both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in
sperm; it is bivalent. One interpretation is that for mature sperm and
early embryos, H3K4me3 prevents DNA methylation while
H3K27me3 promotes silencing, with subsequent H3K4me removal
enabling tissue-specific DNA methylation and secondary imprinting.
Furthermore, our examination of the X chromosome inactivation
centre showed an apparent bivalent status (and DNA hypomethyla-
tion) at the TSS of the XIST noncoding RNA, but not at TSIX,

although future studies are required to determine whether these marks
influence the regulation of this locus in the embryo (Supplementary
Figs 6 and 10d; note that sequence reads on the X chromosome are half
that on autosomes, as it is only present in 50% of sperm).

Modifications and expression timing
Transcriptome analysis has been performed in 4-cell and 8-cell human
embryos, with 29 or 65 messenger RNAs identified as enriched, respect-
ively29. Notably, genes in sperm bearing H3K4me3 but not H3K27me3
correlated with genes expressed at the 4-cell stage (14 out of 24,
P 5 0.059). Also, genes bearing high H3K4me2 were significantly
enriched at genes expressed in the 4–8-cell stage (23 out of 49,
P , 0.02; only 49 tiled on our array). In contrast, no significant correla-
tion was observed with H3K27me3, which instead associates with tran-
scription factors required for differentiation and organogenesis
(discussed earlier). Furthermore, we verified by qPCR the presence of
H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 at a subset of these stage-specific gene promo-
ters (Supplementary Fig. 12). Thus, these findings reveal correlations of
H3K4me2/3 enrichment, but not H3K27 enrichment, with early
expression.

Conclusion
We provide several lines of evidence that the parental genome is pack-
aged and covalently modified in a manner consistent with influencing
embryo development. Previous analyses of DNA methylation in sperm
identified hypomethylated promoters23,24,30,31, showed similarities to the
pattern in ES cells24,31, and overlap between PRC2 and CpG
islands15,17,21,22. We add that hypomethylated developmental promoters
in human sperm overlap significantly with developmental promoters
(in ES cells) occupied by the self-renewal network. Also, the promoters
that acquire methylation in fibroblasts are primarily developmental
transcription factors that are bound by PRC2 in human ES cells, con-
sistent with recent work linking PRC2 to DNA methylation in develop-
ment and neuronal differentiation in mice21,32,33. Thus, components of
the self-renewal network emerge as candidates for helping to direct
DNA hypomethylation in the germ line, and also to guide DNA hyper-
methylation to particular loci during differentiation, possibly to help
‘lock in’ differentiation decisions, although this remains to be tested.

The central findings of our work involve the significant enrich-
ment of modified nucleosomes in the sperm genome at genes for
embryo development, and a specificity to their modification patterns
that might be instructive for the regulation of developmental genes,
noncoding RNAs and imprinted loci. For example, histone retention
and modification were clear at HOX loci and most of the targets of
the self-renewal network in ES cells. One key concept in ES cell
chromatin is the prevalence of developmental promoters with a biva-
lent status—bearing both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (ref. 10). Many
promoters bivalent in ES cells are also bivalent in sperm, although
some bear only H3K27me3 in sperm. Notably, H3K27me3 covers
essentially all of the four HOX loci in sperm, whereas H3K4me3 is
present in large blocks at only a subset of locations in HOX loci. Our
work also provides correlations between H3K4me, but not
H3K27me, and early expression in the embryo. In contrast, prot-
amine-enriched loci did not show any significant Gene Ontology
categories. However, there were certain segments of the Y chro-
mosome with protamine enrichment, including the testis-specific
TSPY genes, although the significance is not known.

We also find histones enriched at imprinted gene clusters, and a
notable correlation between H3K4me3 and paternally expressed non-
coding RNAs and genes; loci that lack DNA methylation in sperm. In
contrast, maternally expressed noncoding RNAs/genes, and especially
paternally methylated regions, lack H3K4me3 and (for the selected
genes tested) contain moderate H3K9me3. Consistent with these
observations, recent structural and in vitro data show that H3K4
methylation deters DNA methylation by DNMT3A2 and DNMT3L
in mice34. However, experiments in model organisms are needed to
address whether the modification patterns we report influence

imprinting patterns in vivo. Taken together, we reveal chromatin
features in sperm that may contribute to totipotency, developmental
decisions and imprinting patterns, and open new questions about
whether ageing and lifestyle affects chromatin in a manner that impacts
fertility or embryo development.

METHODS SUMMARY
Biological samples. Sperm samples were obtained from four men of known
fertility attending the University of Utah Andrology laboratory, consented for
research. Samples were collected after 2–5 days abstinence and subjected to a
density gradient (to purify viable, motile, mature sperm) and treated with so-
matic cell lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 in DEPC H2O) for 20 min
on ice to eliminate white blood cell contamination. Samples were centrifuged at
10,000g for 3 min, and the sperm pellet was resuspended in PBS and used imme-
diately for chromatin preparation. Clontech human fibroblast cells (Lonza cc-
2251) were cultured (37 uC and 5% CO2) in DMEM containing 10% FBS and
supplemented with penicillin and streptomyocin.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Standard ChIP methods were used35, but we
omitted crosslinking and used the following salt concentrations in the numbered
buffers35: (1) 150 mM NaCl, (2) 250 mM NaCl, (3) 200 mM LiCl, and (4)
150 mM NaCl (the PBS wash). Antibodies used were: anti-H3K27me3
(Upstate 07-449), H3K4me3 (Abcam 8580), H3K4me2 (Abcam 32356), TH2B
(Upstate 07-680), H2A.Z (Abcam 4174) and H3K9me3 (Abcam 8898). For each,
4 ml of antibody was coupled to 100 ml of Dynabeads (Invitrogen). After ChIP,
samples for sequencing were not amplified, whereas for arrays the DNA was
amplified (WGA, Sigma) before hybridization.
Methylation profiling using MeDIP. MeDIP procedures for sperm and primary
human fibroblasts (Clonetech) were performed as described previously30.
Sequencing. Sequencing used the Illumina GAII (Illumina Inc.) with standard
protocols. Read numbers are final mapped microsatellite filtered reads (26–36
bases). Nucleosomes from D1: 19,658,110, D2–D4: 18,842,467, D1–4: 25,933,196
with equal contribution from each donor (random sub-sampling). Input, human
sperm DNA: 17,991,622, H3K4me3: 13,337,105, H3K27me3:10,344,413, and
H2A.Z: 5,449,000. All genomics data sets have been deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the SuperSeries GSE15594.

METHODS
Partitioning of histone- and protamine-associated DNA. Chromatin was
prepared from 40 million sperm as described previously36 in the absence of
crosslinking reagent, treated with sequential and increasing MNase (10–
160 U), and centrifuged to sediment protamine-associated DNA, releasing
mononucleosomes. The pooled mononucleosomes were used for ChIP, or the
DNA was extracted and gel purified (,140–155 bp) for sequencing and array
analysis.
ChIP and preparation for genomics methods. All ChIPs for sequencing were
performed using the same pool of mononucleosomes from pooled donors. For
arrays, a single pool was used from D1. ChIP methods were as described previ-
ously35 but were performed without a crosslinking agent and slight modifications
to the salt levels (250 mM NaCl, 200 mM LiCl), and the TE wash was replaced
with a 150 mM PBS wash. ChIP methods used anti-H3K27me3 (Upstate 07-
449), H3K4me3 (Abcam 8580), H3K4me2 (Abcam 32356), TH2B (Upstate 07-
680), or H2A.Z (Abcam 4174) antibodies. For each, 4 ml of antibody was coupled
to 100 ml of Dynabeads (Invitrogen). After the ChIP procedure, the DNA was
amplified (WGA, Sigma) before hybridization to arrays, whereas samples used
for Solexa were not amplified. For sequencing, DNA lengths corresponding to
mononucleosomes with adapters (220–280 bp) were gel purified after the addi-
tion of the Illumina adaptors. This size selection was also performed for the
nucleosomal DNA from pooled donors not subjected to ChIP.
Methylation profiling using MeDIP. This procedure was described previ-
ously30. In brief, sonicated sperm DNA was obtained from two different donors
and sonicated fibroblast DNA was obtained from Clontech primary human
fibroblasts (Lonza CC-2251) (4 mg, 300–1,000-bp fragments).
Immuno-
precipated DNA was washed, subjected to whole genome amplification
(Sigma Aldrich). Amplified DNA (6 mg) was labelled with Cy5, and input
DNA (6 mg) was labelled with Cy3 (Bio labs) by standard methods. Samples were
hybridized to Agilent expanded promoter arrays, treated according to standard
Agilent conditions, and scanned in an Agilent scanner.
Computational analytical methods. The software used in this analysis are open
source and available from the TIMAT2 (http://timat2.sourceforge.net) and USeq
(http://useq.sourceforge.net) project websites. Human annotation and genomic
sequence (May 2004, NCBI Build 35, HG17 and March 2006, NCBI Build 36.1,
HG18) were obtained from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatic website.
Low-level ChIP-chip analysis. Processing of the Agilent microarray promoter
data was performed in three basic steps: data normalization, sliding window
summaries, and enriched region identification. For each data set, the median
unadjusted signal intensities from the Cy3 and Cy5 channels were extracted.
Probes were then mapped to the HG17 or HG18 builds. Biological replicas were
quantile normalized and median scaled to 100 (ref. 37). This normalization was
applied to the treatment (ChIP samples) and control (whole genomic input
DNA for the MeDIP and protamine data sets or DNA derived from mononu-
cleosomes) replicas separately (see later for replica-averaged R2). Probe level
‘Oligo’ summaries were calculated by taking the log2 ratio (mean treatment
replicas/mean control replicas). ‘Window’ level summaries were generated by
identifying windows of a particular size (100 bp for data sets derived from mono-
nucleosomes, 675 bp for MeDIP and protamine data sets) containing a mini-
mum number of oligonucleotide start positions (one for the data sets derived
from mononucleosomes, three for the MeDIP and protamine data sets), and
calculating an all pair (treatment versus control) relative difference pseudo
median. This window summary score was assigned to the centre position of
the window ‘Pse’ or represented as heat map ‘PseHM’ data. Extended regions
of high-scoring windows, called ‘intervals’, were identified by merging windows
that exceed a set threshold and are located within 250 bp of one another. Intervals
were then ranked by their best window score. Relative difference pseudo median
scores were converted to log2 ratio values.

The average R2 values for microarray data were as follows: 0.85 for the three D1
MNase replicas; 0.89 for the three Protamine replicas; 0.96 for the two H3C
replicas; 0.94 for the two H3K4me2 replicas; 0.93 for the two TH2B replicas;
0.96 for the three H3K4me3 replicas; and 0.93 for the two H3K27me3 replicas.
The average MeDIP R2 values for the three replicas of each donor were as follows:
D2 average R2 5 0.97 and D4 5 0.89, and the correlation between D2 versus D4
was 0.87. The average R2 for the two primary human fibroblast MeDIP replicas
was 0.86.
Low-level Chip-seq analysis. The DNA samples derived from mononucleo-
somes, and the sonicated control input genomic DNA were prepared for sequen-
cing using Illumina’s ChIP-seq kit. The 26-bp and 36-bp reads were generated
using Illumina’s Genome Analyser II and their standard software pipeline. Reads
were mapped to the March 2006 NCBI Build 36.1 human genome using the
pipeline’s eland_extended aligner.

The USeq package6 was used to identify regions of histone enrichment relative
to input control. This entailed selecting reads that mapped with an alignment
score $13 (210log10(0.05)), shifting their centre position 73 bp 39 to accommo-
date the 146-bp mononucleosome fragment length, and using a sliding window of
300 bp to score each region in the genome for significant histone enrichment.
Significance was determined by calculating a binomial P value for each 300-bp
window and controlled for multiple testing by applying Storey’s q value FDR
estimation38,39.

Read numbers. Note the sperm genome has only 4% of the genome in nucleo-
somes. For nucleosome enrichment D1 had 19,658,110 reads, and the pool of
three additional donors had 18,842,467 reads. The raw correlation for D1 versus
the donor pool was r 5 0.7. For all the analysis containing pool donors (D1, and a
pooled sample of three additional individuals D2, D3 and D4) we used
25,933,196 mapped filtered reads with equal contribution from each donor
(random subsampling). A total of 17,991,622 reads were generated from control
input human sperm DNA, 3,337,105 reads from the H3K4me3 sample,
10,344,413 reads for H3K27me3, and 5,449,000 reads for H2Az. The raw
unfiltered reads (fastq format) are deposited at GEO under the superseries
GSE15594, which encompasses the Subseries entries GSE15690 for ChIP-seq
and GSE15701 for ChIP-chip data.

To assess histone enrichment consistency, the QCSeqs application in the USeq
package6 was used to correlate the read counts between the D1 and pooled
sample by calculating a Pearson correlation on the basis of the number of
mapped reads falling within 500-bp windowed regions stepped every 250 bp
across all chromosomes. Only windows with five or more reads in either of
the samples were included in the correlation.

To create lists of candidate histone enriched regions, q-value thresholds of 20
(0.01) and 30 (0.001) (210log10(q value)) were selected. Overlapping windows
that pass a given threshold were merged and scores from the best window
assigned to the enriched region. The normalized window score was then used
to rank and sort the regions.

A modification was made to score gene promoters and miRNAs for significant
histone enrichment. The first step was to define regions for scoring. For gene
promoters, the start of the first exon was used to define its hypothetical promoter
by selecting a region 9 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream. For miRNAs, the
centre position of each was expanded 6300 bp. These defined regions were
scored for significant enrichment using the window statistics above.
High-level ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq analysis. Intersect regions. To identify
regions of significant intersection between enriched region lists from various
data sets, the USeq IntersectRegions application was used. This application
counts the number of intersections between two lists of genomic coordinates
that occur within a minimum ‘max gap’ distance. To estimate confidence in the
intersections, a thousand ‘random’ data sets are generated that were matched to
the chromosome and size of the original regions, and randomly picked from the
interrogated regions on the array or sequenced regions in the genome. These
randomized data sets were used to calculate a P value for the intersection and fold
enrichment (fraction real intersection/fraction average random data set inter-
section) over random. Initial pilots that imposed a fraction GC match when
picking random regions showed little difference with non-GC-matched random
data sets and were thus subsequently dropped.

Find neighbouring genes (FNG). Genes associating with histones or histone
modifications were determined using the FNG application in the USeq package.
The gene lists were uploaded in GoMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/gominer/
htgm.jsp) to identify over represented Gene Ontology terms.

Intersect lists. To determine whether the 4- and 8-cell transcripts identified in
early human embryo correlated with any of our histone modifications we used
The IntersectLists USeq application which uses random permutation to calculate
the significance of intersection between two lists of genes.

Aggregate plots. The USeq AggregatePlots application was used to compare
the degree of enrichment and distribution of histone reads surrounding the TSS
of developmental and non developmental genes. The gene classes were derived
on the basis of Gene Ontology term categories.
