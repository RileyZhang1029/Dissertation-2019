BD126FBC109 and BC112/BD140 Display Identical PolyUbiquitination Activity.-ubiquitin western blot showing poly-ubiquitin chain formation during ubiquitination reactions using BD126FBC109 (a) and BC112/BD140 (b) as the E3 with UbcH5c as the E2.
Numbers below each lane indicate minutes after the addition of ATP.
(c) The major structural features of BD126FBC109 are the same as BC112/BD140 as indicated by 1H, 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra.
1H, 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled BD126FBC109 (red spectrum) overlaid on 15N-labeled BC112/BD140 (black spectrum).
Differences between the spectra of the fused and non-fused proteins arise from changes in amino acid composition at the N-and C-terminal regions of BARD1 and BRCA1, respectively.
Data were collected at 37C and with a protein concentration of 300 M.

Structure-Based E2 BRCA1/BARD1 Screen.
Directed yeast two-hybrid screens with E2s found to interact with BD126FBC109.
Plasmids for each bait and prey pair were co-transformed together and with GAL4 DNA binding (DB) and GAL4 activation domain (AD) empty vector controls into the yeast strain AH109.
Positive transformants were selected on minimal synthetic media lacking leucine and tryptophan (Leu/Trp).
Two colonies for each bait and prey were replica plated on selective (His/Leu/Trp 3AT) and non-selective media ( Leu/Trp).
Each E2 was also screened against BD126FBC109-I26A to test for interaction with the BRCA1 RING.

E2-Induced Intensity Changes in Representative BRCA1 Amide Resonances.
Addition of (unlabeled) E2 to 15N-BC112/BD140 causes selective broadening of NMR resonances for residues in the E2-binding site of the BRCA1 RING.
Peak intensities for strongly affected peaks were measured at each point in a titration with E2 and normalized to the BC112/BD140 alone spectrum.
Normalized resonance intensity changes in Ile26 in Zn2+-loop I (top), Leu51 in the central helix (middle), and Leu63 in Zn2+-loop II (bottom) of the BRCA1 RING domain are plotted.
For comparison, intensity changes induced by UbcH5c at 0.5 molar ratio to BRCA1 are also shown (yellow points).
These results suggest only modest differences in the interaction between BRCA1 and select E2 proteins.

Spectral Perturbations on 15N-UbcH5c due to binding of BC112/BD140.
Chemical shift perturbations of 15N-UbcH5c residues (350 M) upon addition of BC112/BD140 (1.0 eq).
Combined chemical shift differences were calculated using the equation =[(HN)2 + (N/6.51)2]1/2.
Red bars correspond to resonances of UbcH5c that are completely broadened upon addition of BC112/BD140.
The average of all UbcH5c resonances observed in the presence of BC112/BD140 is 0.03 ppm.
E2 structural elements involved in other reported E2-E3 interactions are noted.

Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels showing E2~ubiquitin thiol ester formation with mutant and wild-type UbcH5c.
Assays contained 10 M E2, 0.5 M E1, 20 M Ubiquitin (Ub), and either 0 () or 5 mM ATP with 10 mM MgCl2 (+).
Reactions were incubated 30 minutes at 37C.
Duplicate samples were analyzed in the absence (top) or presence (bottom) of reducing agent to identify species containing a thiol ester.

Two resonances in the black spectrum without overlaid red peaks correspond to Ala96 and Leu97.
No other major differences are observed between the two spectra.

Only a small shift in the resonance peak arising from Ile26 of BRCA1 (circled) is observed after addition of UbcH5c-A96D.
No other major differences are observed between the two spectra.
Spectra were collected at 37C and at 300 M each protein.

Poly-Ubiquitination of BRCA1 by Ubc13/Mms2 and Ube2w.-Flag western blot showing auto-ubiquitination of Flag-BC304/BD327 with equal concentration of each indicated E2.
Only the combination of Ubc13, Mms2 and Ube2w results in poly-ubiquitinated BRCA1.
Omission of any one of the E2s results in either mono-ubiquitination or no activity.
Ubc13/Mms2 can also poly-ubiquitinate BRCA1 in combination with the other mono-ubiquitinating E2s, UbcM2 and UbcH5c-S22R (data not shown).
