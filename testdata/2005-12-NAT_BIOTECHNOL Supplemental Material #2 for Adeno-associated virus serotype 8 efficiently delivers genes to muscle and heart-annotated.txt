Fluorescent microscopy (10 seconds exposure) of cryosections of heart and muscles were taken, 4 months after i.v.
injection of 8 1011 v.g.
of dsAAV-CMV-GFP vectors in 6-week-old male F1B hamsters.
Whole-body fluorescent photography of an AAV8-treated hamster also showed strong GFP expression in most of the skeletal muscles.
