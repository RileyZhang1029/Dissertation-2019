NF1 over-expression did not influence the level of whole fly dephosphorylated forkhead transcription factor (dFOXO) levels or a total superoxide dismutase (SOD) or MnSOD activities. a. Western blot analysis of FOXO1 detected by an antibody (Cell Signaling) that preferably binds to dephosphorylated FOXO. Similar levels of dephosphorylated FOXO were found for w1118, K33 and hsNF1/+;K33, verified by Image J densitometry analysis in 3 experiments, one example shown. b. Total SOD and MnSOD activities of K33 and hsNF1/+;K33 flies, mean SD of 5 experiments each involving 50 males and 50 females, total of 500 flies for each genotype. P = 0.79 between their total SOD activities and P = 0.15 between their MnSOD activities.  w1118 K33     hsNF1/+;K33 dFOXO
