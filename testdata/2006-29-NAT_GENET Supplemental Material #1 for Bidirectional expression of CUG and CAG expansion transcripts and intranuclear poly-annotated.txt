Because SCA17 is caused by polyglutamine encoding CAG repeat expansion within the TBP, autopsy tissue from a genetically confirmed SCA17 patient was used as a positive control.
In the SCA17 tissue, TBP staining is found in the nuclei of pontine neurons (a) (representative pan-nuclear reaction enlarged in box) and cerebellar granule cells (d).
No staining is found in tissues from an SCA8 BAC-Exp mouse (b, e) or an SCA8 patient (c, f) in which 1C2-positive intranuclear inclusions/pan-nuclear reaction were confirmed.
Scale bars each = 30m
