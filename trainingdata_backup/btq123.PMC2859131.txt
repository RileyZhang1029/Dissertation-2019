One of the steps required to turn these sequences into valuable information is gene content prediction.
To date, there is no publicly available gene predictor specifically trained for maize sequences.
To this end, we have chosen to train the EuGne software that can combine several sources of evidence into a consolidated gene model prediction.

Received on November 10, 2009; revised on March 17, 2010; accepted on March 18, 2010 1 INTRODUCTION The B73 maize genome sequence is now available (Schnable et al., 2009).
We can anticipate that next generation sequencing technologies will soon supply a deluge of genomic data from other maize genotypes.
Therefore, in addition to the annotation provided by the maize sequence consortium for the B73 genotype, the community will also need a tool for the annotation of maize genomic sequences produced from other genotypes.
To date, the www.maizesequence.org web site provides the Filtered Gene Set including annotation of 32 540 gene models (RefGen_v1), based on biological evidence.
However, no tool is provided to annotate personal sequences yet.
Fgenesh (Salamov and Solovyev, 2000) was among the first ab initio gene prediction softwares available for maize while it was trained for monocot species.
Combiner softwares like EuGne (Foissac and Schiex, 2005) can improve their own ab initio prediction results by integrating information from sequence alignment software, from splice site and translation start site prediction software or from other gene finder algorithms, thereby improving prediction quality.
EuGne uses probabilistic Markov models to discriminate coding sequences from non-coding ones, or genuine splice sites from false ones.
Gene models generated by EuGne are associated with a score based on all the available information.
In order to calculate the weight for each information source and to calibrate its ab initio prediction module, EuGne was trained using a maize-curated gene sequence set built in this study.

2 METHODS To build cognate gDNA/cDNA pairs, 6700 (4000 BAC) maize genomic sequences and 5500 full-length cDNA (FLcDNA) were extracted from the NCBI databases and filtered using an automatic pipeline designed on-site.
First, cDNA sequences were trimmed using Seqclean (http://www.tigr.org/) and the Univec database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html).
Then cDNA redundancy was removed based on an all against all cDNA BLAST analysis (E-value threshold 1e-100).
Non-redundant cDNAs were then aligned onto the BAC sequences using BLAT (Kent, 2002).
To avoid ambiguous alignments such as cDNA mapping to several gDNAs, a spliced alignment was computed using GenomeThreader (Gremme et al., 2005), and the best alignment was retained as the correct gDNA/cDNA pair.
Next, for each gDNA/cDNA pair, the coding sequence was determined from an alignment with the corresponding protein from maize or rice.
Each of the 247 validated pairs was manually checked before inclusion into the training set.
The third-party prediction softwares used by EuGne maize are SpliceMachine (Degroeve et al., 2005; donor and acceptor splicing site prediction), GenomeThreader (spliced alignment), BlastX (Altschul et al., 1997; protein alignment) and optionally Fgenesh (ab initio gene prediction).
The sequence database used for prediction contains 69 306 maize FLcDNAs from GenBank, 20 508 rice mRNAs from RAPdb, 342 491 maize PlantGDBassembled Unique Transcripts (PUT) from PlantGDB, 593 maize proteins from Uniprot/SwissProt, 19 836 rice proteins from RAPdb and 26 751 Arabidopsis proteins from TAIR (see the EuGne-maize web site for an updated listing of sequence resources and corresponding full
