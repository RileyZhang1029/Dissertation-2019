A number of approaches using either perturbation (knock-out) or wild-type time-series data have appeared in the literature addressing this problem, with the latter using linear temporal models.
Nonlinear dynamical models are particularly appropriate for this inference task, given the generation mechanism of the time-series data.
In this study, we introduce a novel nonlinear autoregressive model based on operator-valued kernels that simultaneously learns the model parameters, as well as the network structure.
Results: A flexible boosting algorithm (OKVAR-Boost) that shares features from L2-boosting and randomization-based algorithms is developed to perform the tasks of parameter learning and network inference for the proposed model.
Specifically, at each boosting iteration, a regularized Operator-valued Kernel-based Vector AutoRegressive model (OKVAR) is trained on a random subnetwork.
The final model consists of an ensemble of such models.
The empirical estimation of the ensemble models Jacobian matrix provides an estimation of the network structure.
The performance of the proposed algorithm is first evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets from the DREAM3 challenge and then on real datasets related to the In vivo Reverse-Engineering and Modeling Assessment (IRMA) and T-cell networks.
The high-quality results obtained strongly indicate that it outperforms existing approaches.

Gene regulatory networks (GRN) have the potential to provide us with the cellular context of all genes of interest, as well as with a means to identify specific subnetworks that are malfunctioning in a given disease state (Cam et al., 2004; Jesmin et al., 2010).
A diverse suite of mathematical tools has been developed and used to infer gene regulatory interactions from spatial and temporal high-throughput gene expression data (see Bansal et al., 2007; Markowetz and Spang, 2007 and
