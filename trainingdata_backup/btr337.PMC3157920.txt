The analysis uncovers and summarizes discriminating background information (e.g.GO annotations) for sets of genes identified by experiments (e.g.a set of differentially expressed genes, a cluster).
The discovered information is utilized by human experts to find biological interpretations of the experiments.
However, AEA isolates and tests for overrepresentation only individual annotation terms or groups of similar terms and is limited in its ability to uncover complex phenomena involving relationship between multiple annotation terms from various knowledge bases.
Also, AEA assumes that annotations describe the whole object of interest, which makes it difficult to apply it to sets of compound objects (e.g.sets of proteinprotein interactions) and to sets of objects having an internal structure (e.g.protein complexes).
Results: We propose a novel logic-based Annotation Concept Synthesis and Enrichment Analysis (ACSEA) approach.
ACSEA fuses inductive logic reasoning with statistical inference to uncover more complex phenomena captured by the experiments.
We evaluate our approach on large-scale datasets from several microarray experiments and on a clustered genome-wide genetic interaction network using different biological knowledge bases.
The discovered interpretations have lower P-values than the interpretations found by AEA, are highly integrative in nature, and include analysis of quantitative and structured information present in the knowledge bases.
The results suggest that ACSEA can boost effectiveness of the processing of high-throughput experiments.

One of the main challenges of modern To whom correspondence should be addressed.

AEA approach.
Study Set is a set of genes identified by an experiment (such as differentially expressed genes or one of the clusters).
Universe Set is the set of all the genes that participated in the experiment or some other reference set of genes that the study set will be compared against.
Annotation Database is a source of annotations attached to genes.
Result of the analysis is a set of annotations that are over-or underrepresented in the Study Set comparing to the Universe Set.
bioinformatics is to develop methods and techniques that can help inferring knowledge from accumulated datasets and large-scale experimental data.
High-throughput experimental techniques typically generate sets of genes that require further investigation.
For example, such sets may be produced by clustering microarray data or by extracting differentially expressed genes.
The sets usually contain dozens or hundreds of genes, and their biological interpretation poses significant challenge to biology experts.
Recently a number of algorithms have been developed to help experts interpreting experimental data.
One of the most popular approaches is Annotation Enrichment Analysis (AEA) (Huang et al., 2009; Khatri and Draghici, 2005).
AEA uses the biological knowledge already accumulated in public databases to systematically examine large lists of genes trying to suggest biological interpretations of the experimental data.
AEA algorithms extract descriptive information (called gene annotations) characterizing each gene and compare the statistical distributions of gene annotations between the gene set of interest (known as study set) and the rest of the genome or the rest of the microarray (known as universe set).
Figure 1 illustrates the approach.
AEA is agnostic to the way universe and study sets are constructed.
It contrasts it with other approaches, The Author(s) 2011.

Bag-of-annotations data model.
such as Reconstruction of Formal Temporal Logic Models (Ramakrishnan et al., 2005) which implicitly includes temportal annotations into analysis.
A variety of algorithms and tools are based on the AEA framework.
They differ by the knowledge bases used as source for annotations (Gene Ontology: a controlled vocabulary of genes attributes, KEGG: pathway information, BIND: proteinprotein interactions, etc.
(Alibs et al., 2008; Al-Shahrour et al., 2004; Minguez et al., 2007; Sherman et al., 2007), statistical hypothesis testing models (2, Fishers exact test, Binomial distribution, Hypergeometric distribution, etc.
), types and organization of annotation terms, and sets of reference genes (Huang et al., 2009; Khatri and Draghici, 2005).
The data representation model used in AEA is bag-of-annotations (Fig.2).
By analogy with a bag-of-words representation used in text mining, bag-of-annotations associates a set of annotation terms with each gene (Beibarth and Speed, 2004; Berriz et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005; Zhou and Su, 2007).
While bag-of-annotations is a very popular and efficient model allowing natural application of statistical inference methods, it has a number of disadvantages.
The main weakness of the model is the limitation in the types of annotation terms and relations that may be used as well as the types and the complexity of enriched phenomena that can be discovered and described.
Several research projects have proposed improvements to AEA algorithms and statistical models to address the issues partially rooted in the bag-of-annotation model.
For example, graph decorrelation methods (Alexa et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2008; Grossmann et al., 2007) modify statistical tests to consider the GO graph; ProfCom method (Antonov et al., 2008) finds enriched combinations of annotation terms using and, or, not operators; GSEA method (Subramanian et al., 2005) compares the study set to curated sets; DAVID tool (Huang et al., 2007) partitions a set of genes based on the annotations; CLEAN tool uses cluster analysis of annotations (Freudenberg et al., 2009).
However, these are solutions targeting specific databases or output structure.
To overcome the analytical challenges posed by the bag-ofannotations model, we propose a new paradigm:Annotation Concept Synthesis and Enrichment Analysis (ACSEA).
ACSEA utilizes a logic-based data representation model and a fusion of inductive logic reasoning and statistical inference in the general framework of AEA.
The results of ACSEAs evaluation suggest that it is a very potent technique capable of increasing the efficiency (i.e.the ease of data analysis by a human expert) and effectiveness (i.e.the quality and quantity of the obtained knowledge) of the processing of high-throughput experiments.
2 METHODS The cornerstone ofACSEAis a logic-based representation and mining model.
In this model, all readily available information about genes is represented by logic statements.
Inductive logic reasoning together with statistical inference is then applied to synthesize logic formulas (called annotation concepts) discriminating genes belonging to the study set from genes belonging to the universe set.
Then, following AEA approach, constructed annotation concepts are sorted according to their P-value and the best of them are presented to the biology expert.
2.1 Logic-based knowledge representation Due to the evolutionary, distributed and complex nature of biological research, modern biological knowledge is spread over many annotation databases.
The captured knowledge itself is of very diverse and often complex structure: Gene Ontology (multiple ontologies/DAGs); KEGG (pathways); InterPro motifs (DAG of sequence patterns); Swiss-Prot keywords (bag of words); PubMed (literature); BIND (interaction map); Protein Databank (sequences, 3D structures, global properties); and UniProt, NCBI (cross
