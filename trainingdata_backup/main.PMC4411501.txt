Here, we provide a brief introduction on some of the most notable microbial web resources and an evaluation of them based upon our own user experience.
Introduction Microorganisms are found virtually everywhere in the environment and serve as important biological resources.
Some microorganisms have become widely utilized in industrial production.
With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology in recent years, it is considerably easier to obtain whole genome sequence of microorganisms.
To date, thousands ofmicrobes have been sequenced.
Due to the difficulties of isolating single microbial species, high-throughput sequencing technology has been applied to mixtures of environmental microbes to obtain metagenome sequencing data.
One metagenomics endeavor is the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), which aims to obtain metagenomic sequencing data from a large number of human subjects to enhance our understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and human health.
In this review, we provide a brief introduction on some of the most useful microbial web resources (Table 1), including information on collection of microbial cultures, species identification, literature, patent resources, microbial genomics, and metagenomics, as well as tools for analyzing genomic and metagenomic data.
In addition, we have evaluated their function and provided ratings for each resource based on our own user experience.
Integrated Microbial Genomes The Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG, http://img.jgi.doe.
gov/) system [1] is a combined web resource of microbial genome datasets, including genome sequences and gene annotations.
The aim of the IMG is to provide free microbial genomic data, together with integrated annotations and comparative analysis services, to scientists worldwide.
