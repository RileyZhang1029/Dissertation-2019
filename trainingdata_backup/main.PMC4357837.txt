12.11.005 Abstract For the past few decades, intensive studies have been carried out in an attempt to understand how the amino acid sequences of proteins encode their three dimensional structures to perform their specific functions.
In order to understand the sequence-structure relationship of proteins, several sub-sequence search studies in non-redundant sequence-structure databases have been undertaken which have given some fruitful clues.
In our earlier work, we analyzed a set of 3124 nonredundant protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and retrieved 30 identical octapeptides having different secondary structures.
These octapeptides were characterized by using different computational procedures.
This prompted us to explore the presence of octapeptides with reverse sequences and to analyze whether these octapeptides would adopt similar structures as that of their parent octapeptides.
Our identical reverse octapeptide search resulted in the finding of eight octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and reverse octapeptide) with similar secondary structure and 23 octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures.
In the present work, the geometrical and biophysical characteristics of identical reverse octapeptides were explored and compared with unrelated octapeptide pairs by using various computational tools.
We thus conclude that proteins containing identical reverse octapeptides are not very abundant and residues in the octapeptide pairs do not contribute to the stability of the protein.
Furthermore, compared to unrelated octapeptides, identical reverse octapeptides do not show certain biophysical and geometrical properties.
Introduction With the vast amount of knowledge gained from the three dimensional (3D) structures of proteins, one might expect to (Selvaraj S).

However this is not the case and many unsolved problems remain.
Various attempts have been made to study the stability and folding of proteins and peptides by using reduced representation of proteins as well as by reading the protein sequences backward.
Several theoretical and experimental approaches toward studying retro proteins have been carried out and give contradictory results [1].
Skolnick and coworkers made a systematic study by generating retro proteins and found a very low number of similar 3D structures between inversely similar proteins and they also reported that short helices keep their conformations even when the sequence is inverted [2].

Production and hosting mailto:selvarajsamuel@gmail.comSaravanan KM and Selvaraj S/ Search for Identical Reverse Octapeptides in Unrelated Proteins 115 sequence databases revealed that a protein with identical composition but with backward read primary structure should fold under native conditions in to a similar structure compared with the original sequence [3].
Since the retro protein has the same amino acid composition and hydrophobicity profiles as the native protein, all structure prediction methods based on amino acid composition may fail.
The assumption that the retro protein would adopt the mirror image of the native protein is very unlikely, because righthanded helices would have to be replaced by left-handed helices.
Changes in the secondary structure of the retro protein are significant because the packing of the native topology is similar to the packing of the original protein [4].
Nebel et al proposed that the abundance of retro proteins primarily can be explained by the fact that they display the same repeat structures and amino acid propensity of existing proteins [5].
In contrast to proteins, studies of smaller peptide fragments with inverted sequences have provided fruitful clues toward understanding protein sequence-structure relationships.
Several studies on reversed proteins and peptides consisting of D-amino acidswhich form themirror image structures of the respective Lamino acid protein have been carried out [68] and validated experimentally by synthesizing D-human immuno deficiency virus protease which showed reciprocal chirality [9].
There are several other interesting studies of retro peptides.
One such example is a hairpin peptide mimic of the FcRI chain that inhibits IgE-FcRI interactions both in its native and retro form, which has potential for the treatment of allergic disorders [10].
Rai has used the S peptide from ribonuclease S as a model system and explored the relationship between native and reverse conformations of the peptide by using circular dichroism (CD) [7].
Huang and coworkers synthesized a novel peptide by reversing the sequence of the human metallothionein-2a domain to analyze its chemical and spectroscopic properties.
The results of their analysis indicate that the reversion of the amino acid sequence for a domain does not change its foldability and metal-binding capacity, suggesting that the order of its sequence is not essential for the formation of a critical metaltetrathiolate nucleus [11].
In our previous work, we performed a systematic analysis of the role of long-range contacts in homologous families of proteins in determining the final native structure [12].
Our analysis indicated the importance of cooperative long-range interactions in determining the final conformations of two proteins with 88% sequence identity but adopting different folds and functions [13].
The importance of cooperative long-range interactions for protein stability was further verified experimentally by studying the fragments of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 in barley [14].
In our previous paper, we have characterized 30 identical octapeptides adopting different conformations by computing difference in the number of long-range contacts of residues [15].
In the present work, we performed a systematic search of identical reverse octapeptides in the sequences of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [16] to explore the structural and functional features of the protein fragments in reversed form.
The results from our analysis imply that protein fragments of eight residues of a given protein and their reversed form in another unrelated protein are not very abundant.
The geometric and biophysical properties, such as volume, surface area, dipole and quadrapole moments and continuous symmetry measure in such octapeptides, were examined in detail.
Also the gene ontology (GO) terms of the proteins containing reverse octapeptides are extracted to understand the structure-function relationship.
Results Reverse octapeptide search While searching for the reverse formof the overlapping octapeptide segments in each of the proteins of the 3124 PDB sequences, we found 8 octapeptide pairs (octapeptide and reverse octapeptide) with similar secondary structure (Table S1) and 23 octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures (Table 1).
The occurrence of proteins containing identical reverse octapeptides with similar and different secondary structures is very low, which was 0.5% and 1.4%, respectively, while 98% of proteins do not contain identical reverse octapeptides.
These data demonstrated the low abundance of such inverse fragments in a large number of unrelated protein sequences.
However, it is not surprising that an octapeptide and its reverse sequence adopt similar secondary structures, due to the similar amino acid composition and certain similar biophysical properties such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, etc.
Interestingly, we have found eight octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure, which are mainly made up of helices.
The occurrence of each of the 20 amino acid residues in reverse octapeptides having similar and different conformations is shown in Figure 1.
Leucine (L) and glutamic acid (E), which are generally considered as helix favoring residues, appear with high percentage, whereas in peptides adopting different secondary structures, their occurrence was relatively low (10% and 9%, respectively).
Since glutamic acid and its salts perform important functions such as neurotransmitting and flavor enhancing, understanding the role of glutamic acid in octapeptides may provide fruitful insights in peptide and biomaterials design [17].
The low occurrence of tryptophan (W) may be explained by the fact that the L-stereoisomer of tryptophan is present in proteins, but the D-stereoisomer is only occasionally found in naturally-produced peptides [18].
The amino acid residues in the octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure are mainly occupied by hydrophilic residues and they are generally surrounded by very minimum contacting residues [1920].
Since hydrophobic residues tend to be buried in the core of proteins, the low occurrence of hydrophobic residues in octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure suggests that octapeptide fragments would be found on the protein surface and contribute to various interactions with other molecules.
On the other hand, majority of the residues in octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures are neither hydrophilic (D, E, R, K and H) nor hydrophobic residues (F, I, L, M, V,W, A and P).
Instead, these octapeptide pairs are mainly made up of residues such as G, S, T, C, N, Q and Y.
Volume and surface area of octapeptide pairs The functional specificity of a peptide arises from its unique physicochemical properties such as volume and surface area, which are important geometrical quantities associated with macromolecular structures and motions.
Hence, we performed a systematic analysis of surface area and volume of octapeptide pairs with similar conformations (Table S1) and those with different conformations (Table 1).

Consequently, the correlation coefficient between surface areas of the identical reverse octapeptide pairs with similar secondary structure and that of the octapeptide pairs with different secondary structures is 0.95 and 0.73, respectively.
However, the correlation coefficient between volume and surface area of unrelated octapeptide pairs with similar and different secondary structures seems to be very poor (0.04 and 0.03) (Table S2).
The difference in surface areas of unrelated octapeptide pairs implies that the octapeptide and its reverse octapeptide show similar geometric properties such as volume and surface area.
Hence, from our results, we suggest that the octapeptides and their reverse have similar spatial arrangements like related octapeptide pairs whereas unrelated octapeptide pairs do not adopt similar volume and surface area.
The Ca average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of identical reverse octapeptides is 2.27, which is 3.01 for unrelated octapeptide pairs.
This implies that the Ca atoms of the unrelated octapeptides and identical reverse octapeptides may not be accurately superimposed on their pair, probably due to the influence of several other factors such as conformation angle p
