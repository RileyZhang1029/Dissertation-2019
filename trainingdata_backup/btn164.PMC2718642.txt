Given a graph representing pairwise protein interaction data one can search for subgraphs representing protein complexes.
Previous methods for performing such search relied on the assumption that complexes form a clique in that graph.
While this assumption is true for some complexes, it does not hold for many others.
New algorithms are required in order to recover complexes with other types of topological structure.
Results: We present an algorithm for inferring protein complexes from weighted interaction graphs.
By using graph topological patterns and biological properties as features, we model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN).
We use a training set of known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN model.
The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN is then used to score subgraphs in the protein interaction graph and identify new complexes.
We applied our method to protein interaction data in yeast.
As we show our algorithm achieved a considerable improvement over clique based algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known complexes.
We discuss some of the new complexes predicted by our algorithm and determine that they likely represent true complexes.

Correctly identifying the interaction network among proteins in an organism is useful for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying given biological functions.
Beyond individual interactions, there is a lot more systematic information contained in protein interaction graphs.
Complex formation is one of the typical patterns in this graph and many cellular functions are performed by these complexes containing multiple protein interaction partners.
As the number of species for which global high throughput protein interaction data is measured becomes larger (Ito et al., 2001; Rual et al., 2003; Stelzl et al., 2005; Uetz et al., 2000), methods for accurately identifying complexes from such data become a bottleneck for further analysis of the resulting interaction graphs.
To whom correspondence should be addressed.
High-throughput experimental approaches aiming to specifically determine the components of protein complexes on a proteomewide scale suffer from high false positive and false negative rates (von Mering et al., 2002).
In particular, mass spectrometry methods (Gavin et al., 2002; Ho et al., 2002) may miss complexes that are not present under the given conditions; tagging may disturb complex formation and weakly associated components may dissociate and escape detections.
Therefore, accurately identifying protein complexes remains a challenge.
The logical connections between proteins in complexes can be best represented as a graph where the nodes correspond to proteins and the edges correspond to the interactions.
Extracting the set of protein complexes from these graphs can help obtain insights into both the topological properties and functional organization of protein networks in cells.
Previous attempts at automatic complex identification have mainly involved the use of binary protein protein interaction graphs.
Most methods utilized unsupervised graph clustering for this task by trying to discover densely connected subgraphs.
Automatic complex identification approaches can be divided into five categories: (1) Graph segmentation.
To identify complexes King et al.(2004) partitioned the nodes of a given graph into distinct clusters using a cost-based local search algorithm.
Zotenko et al.(2006) proposed a graph-theoretical approach to identify functional groups and provided a representation of overlaps between functional groups in the form of the Tree of Complexes.
(2) Overlapping clustering.
Since some proteins participate in multiple complexes or functional modules, a number of approaches allow overlapping clusters.
Bader et al.(2003b) detected densely connected regions in large PPI networks using vertex weights representing local neighborhood density.
Pereira-Leal et al.(2004) used the line graph strategy of the network (where a node represents an interaction between two proteins and edges share interactors between interactions) to produce an overlapping graph partitioning of the original PPI network.
Adamcsek et al.(2006) identified overlapping densely interconnected groups in a given undirected graph using the k-clique percolation clusters in the network.
Spirin et al.(2003) discovered molecular modules that are densely connected with themselves but sparsely connected with the rest of the network by analyzing the multibody structure of the PPI network.
(3) New similarity measures.
Rives et al.(2003) applied standard clustering algorithms to group similar nodes on the interaction graph.
The cluster similarity is calculated on vectors of nodes attributes, such as their shortest path distances to other nodes.
(4) Conservation across species.
Sharan et al.(2005) used conservation alignment to find protein complexes that are common to yeast and bacteria.

They formulated a log-likelihood ratio model to represent individual edges between proteins and assumed a clique structure for a protein complex.
(5) Spatial constraints analysis.
By utilizing the spatial aspects of complex formation, Scholtens et al.(2005) applied a local modeling method to better estimate the protein complex membership from direct mass spectrometry complex data and Y2H binary interaction data.
Chu et al.(2006) proposed an infinite latent feature model to identify protein complexes and their constituents from large-scale direct mass spectrometry sets.
The methods presented above are based on the assumption that complexes form a clique in the interaction graph.
While this is true for many complexes, there are many other topological structures that may represent a complex on a PPI graph.
One example is a star or spoke model, in which all vertices connect to a Bait protein (Bader et al., 2003a).
Another possible topology is a structure that links several small densely connected components with loose linked edges.
This topology is especially attractive for large complexes: due to spatial limitations, it is unlikely that all proteins in a large complex can interact with all others.
See Figure 1 for some examples of real complexes with different topologies.
While some previous work was carried out to identify such structures in PPI networks [most notable by looking for network motifs (Yeger-Lotem et al., 2004)], these structure were not exploited for complex discovery.
In this article we present a computational framework that can identify complexes without making strong assumptions about their topology.
Instead of the cliqueness assumption, we derive several properties from known complexes, and use these properties to search for new complexes.
Since our method relies on real complexes, it does not assume any prior model for complexes.
Our algorithm is probabilistic.
Following training to determine the importance of different properties, it can assign a score to any subgraph in the graph.
By thresholding this likelihood ratio score we can label some of the subgraphs as complexes.
Our model results in a significantly improved F1score when compared to the density-based approaches.
Using a cross validation analysis we show that the graphs discovered by our method highly coincide with complexes from the hand-curated MIPS database and a recent high confidence mass spectrometry dataset (Gavin et al., 2006).
The top-ranked new complexes are likely to provide novel hypotheses for the mechanism of action or definition of function of proteins within the predicted complex as we discuss in Section 3.
2 METHODS The main feature of our method is that it considers the possibility of multiple factors defining complexes in protein interaction graphs.
Instead of assuming a specific topological model, we design a general framework which learns to weigh possible subgraph patterns based on the available known complexes.
Previous analysis of known PPI graphs has already revealed multiple shapes forming subgraphs.
For example, Bader et al.(2003a) proposed two topological models in the context of protein complexes.
The first is the matrix model which assumes that each of the members in the complex physically interact with all other members (leading to a clique-like structure).
The second shape is the spoke model that assumes that all proteins in a complex directly interact with one bait protein leading to a star shape.
Hybrids of these or other models are also possible, resulting in more complex topologies.
Besides graph structures, there could be other features that characterize complexes.
In particular, complexes have certain biological, chemical or physical properties that distinguish them from non-complexes.
For example, the physical size of a complex may be an important feature.
There is a physical limitation of creating large complexes because inner proteins become inaccessible and therefore more difficult to regulate.
By incorporating such additional features into our supervised learning framework, the proposed model is able to integrate multiple evidence sources to identify new complexes in the PPI graph.
The input to our algorithm is a weighted graph of interacting proteins.
The network is modeled as a graph, where vertexes represent proteins and edges represent interactions.
Edge weights represent the likelihoods for the interactions.
Since the current data does not provide any directionality information, the PPI graph considered in this article is a weighted undirected graph.
Our objective is to recover the protein complexes from this undirected PPI graph.
Computationally speaking, complexes are one special kind of subgraphs on the PPI network.
A subgraph represents a subset of nodes with a specific set of edges connecting them.
The number of distinct subgraphs, or clusters, grows exponentially with the number of nodes.
2.1 Complex features Extracting appropriate features for subgraphs representing complexes is related to the problem of measuring the similarity between complex subgraphs.
This task has been studied for other networks, specifically social networks (Chakrabarti et al., 2005; Robins et al., 2005; Virtanen, 2003).
