It is accessible both programmatically and interactively.
Availability: The Synergizer is freely available to all users interactively via a web application (http://llama.med.harvard.edu/ synergizer/translate) and programmatically via a web service.
Clients implementing the Synergizer application programming interface (API) are also freely available.
Please visit http://llama.med.harvard.edu/ synergizer/doc for details.
Contact: fritz_roth@hms.harvard.edu With the wealth of information available in biological databases has come a proliferation of namespaces, i.e.schemes for naming biological entities (genes, proteins, metabolites, etc.).
For example, a single gene might be identified as IL1RL1 in the HGNC symbol namespace, ENSG00000115602 in the Ensembl gene id namespace, and Hs.66 in the Unigene namespace, while a protein product of that gene might be identified as NP_003847 in the RefSeq peptide namespace and IPI00218676 within the International Protein Index (IPI) namespace.
The lack of standardized gene and protein identifiers remains a fundamental hindrance to biological research, and is particularly obstructive to strategies based on integrating high-throughput data from disparate sources (e.g.combining mRNA expression data with protein interaction and functional annotations).
A very common task is the translation of an ordered set of identifiers from one namespace to another.
The Synergizer is a database, associated with both programmatic and interactive web interfaces, with the sole purpose of helping researchers (both bench scientists and bioinformaticians) perform this deceptively simple task.
The simplest way to describe the use of the programmatic interface is via a short example Perl script (see Fig.1) using the Perl module Synergizer::DemoClient (available for download; see Availability above).
The key functionality of the Synergizer application programming interface (API) is represented here by the function translate (line 11).
When executed, this function generates a remote procedure call in the form of a JSON-encoded object, and sends it via HTTP to To whom correspondence should be addressed.
a remote Synergizer server.
This server translates the identifiers in the ids argument (lines 79) from one namespace (here designated as the domain) to another (designated the range), using mappings provided by the specified authority [in this case Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2002)].
These results are returned via HTTP to the script, where they are assigned to the variable $translated as a reference to an array of arrays, one array per original input identifier (since an input identifier may return zero, one or several translations).
Some identifiers (e.g.pxn in the example) that belong to the domain namespace, but for which no equivalent in the range namespace was found, will return no translations.
To highlight inputs that were not found in the domain namespace (e.g.?test?
), these identifiers are translated to the undefined value.
For further details, please consult the Synergizer API (see Availability above).
It is important to note that although the example above is written in Perl, the Synergizer service is language independent (as well as platform independent).
The API for the service is publicly available and it is a simple matter to write API-conforming clients in Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, JavaScript or any other modern programming language.
A second illustration of the service is its web front end, (see Availability above), which is itself a Synergizer client application (illustrating the language independence of the Synergizer API, this client is written in JavaScript as opposed to the earlier example in Perl).
Although several tools are available to translate biological identifiers (for example, see
