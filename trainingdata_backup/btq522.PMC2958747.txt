After generating a set of potential interactions, biologists face the problem of highlighting the ones that are novel and collecting evidence with respect to literature and annotation.
This task can be as tedious as searching for every predicted interaction in several interaction data repositories, or manually screening the scientific literature.
To facilitate the task of evidence mining and novelty assessment of proteinprotein interactions, we have developed a Cytoscape plugin that automatically mines publication
