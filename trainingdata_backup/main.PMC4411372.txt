Abstract Repetitive DNA sequences are a major component of eukaryotic genomes and may account for up to 90% of the genome size.
They can be divided into minisatellite, microsatellite and satellite sequences.
Satellite DNA sequences are considered to be a fast-evolving component of eukaryotic genomes, comprising tandemly-arrayed, highly-repetitive and highly-conserved monomer sequences.
The monomer unit of satellite DNA is 150400 base pairs (bp) in length.
Repetitive sequences may be species-or genus-specific, and may be centromeric or subtelomeric in nature.
They exhibit cohesive and concerted evolution caused by molecular drive, leading to high sequence homogeneity.
Repetitive sequences accumulate variations in sequence and copy number during evolution, hence they are important tools for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, and are known as tuning knobs in the evolution.
Therefore, knowledge of repetitive sequences assists our understanding of the organization, evolution and behavior of eukaryotic genomes.
Repetitive sequences have cytoplasmic, cellular and developmental effects and play a role in chromosomal recombination.
In the post-genomics era, with the introduction of next-generation sequencing technology, it is possible to evaluate complex genomes for analyzing repetitive sequences and deciphering the yet unknown functional potential of repetitive sequences.
Introduction Genomes of higher eukaryotes contain more DNA than expected when estimates are based on the length and number of coding genes in the genomes.
The amount of DNA in the unreplicated genome, or the haploid genome, of a species is known as C-value or Constant-value [1,2].
The lack of correlation between size and complexity of eukaryotic genomes, largely due to the presence of noncoding highly repetitive DNA, is termed as the C-value paradox, which is a common phenomenon observed in higher plants.
It is believed that the proportion of protein-coding sequences is generally similar for different plant species, with variation in genome size mainly due to the presence of repetitive DNA [3,4] that has accumulated in the genomes during evolution, since ancestral angiosperms had been indicated to possess small genomes [5].
The term repetitive sequences refers to homologous DNA fragments that are present in multiple copies in the genome.
Repetitive DNA sequences are present in all higher plants and can account for nces and Mehrotra S and Goyal V/ Repetitive DNA in Plants 165 up to 90% of the genome size in some species.
These repetitive DNA sequences are considered to generate major differences between genomes, which may reflect evolutionary distances between species.
The repetitive sequences were once thought to be selfish elements or junk DNA [6,7], since they do not harbor genes.
Knowledge of the distribution, genomic organization, chromosomal location and evolutionary origin of repetitive DNA sequences is necessary for insight into the organization, evolution, behavior and functional potential of repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes [8].
In the last few decades, several repetitive sequences have been analyzed (Table 1) to gain more information on primary structure, molecular organization, evolution and function of repetitive sequences, whereas more recently genome-sequencing technology has produced an unprecedented wealth of information about origin, diversity and genomic impact of repetitive sequences [9].
Types and distribution of repetitive DNA sequences The genomes of most eukaryotes contain a variety of repetitive DNA sequences [10,11].
Repetitive DNA may be dispersed throughout the genome or may be restricted at specific locations in a tandem configuration.
According to the length of the repeated unit and array size, tandem repeated DNA sequences can be classified into three groups: (i) microsatellites with 25 bp repeats and an array size of the order of 10100 units, (ii) minisatellites with 6100 bp (usually around 15 bp) repeats and an array size of 0.530 kb and (iii) satellite DNA (satDNA) with a variable AT-rich repeat unit that often forms arrays up to 100 Mb.
The monomer length of satDNA sequences ranges from 150400 bp in majority of plants and animals.
satDNA sequences are located at heterochromatic regions, which are found mostly in centromeric and subtelomeric regions in the chromosomes but also at intercalary positions.
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of different types of repetitive sequences on a plant chromosome.
Satellite DNAs are portions of the genome that can be separated as satellite peaks from primary DNA peaks [12] using the methods including restriction endonuclease digestion, colony filter hybridization with relic DNA, amplification with specific primers, colony filter hybridization and genomic selfamplification (also known as self-priming) [13].
Clustered DNA repeats can be detected in centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin, and are transcriptionally inert.
Centromeric DNA (such as CENH3) is the most abundant tandem repeats found in both plants and animals [14].
In contrast, subtelomeric repetitive sequence families are usually genus-specific, such as TrsA and Os48 in Oryza species [15,16]; TrsB in Oryza brachyantha [17]; SacI family in Silene latifolia [18]; and pAv34, pAc34, pRp34, pRn34 and pRs34 in Beta species [19], or chromosome (Chr)-specific, such asWE 35 onChr 5B inTriticum aestivum [20], JNK family on Chr 2R in Secale cereale [21], AfaI family in Poaceae members [22], TRI on Chr Y in Silene latifolia [23] and RUSI on Chr 1 in Rumex species [24].
A particular sequence may be either species-specific or present in many species within a taxonomic family or various families, indicating that some repetitive sequences evolve rapidly, whereas others may be conserved [25].
For instance, the CL600 satellite repeat isolated from Citrus limon was detected in other Rutaceae members (C. aurantium, C. paradisi, Poncirus trifoliata and Fortunella margarita) [26].
Similarly, the PCvKB repetitiveDNA isolated fromCrocus vernuswas present in 16 species ofCrocus analyzed and 2 species of Iridaceae, 3 species of Liliaceae and 1 species of Amaryllidaceae [27].
The HindIII repeat of Brassica campestris shows homology not only to that of other Brassica species but also to that of Raphanus sativus, Sinapis alba, Diplotaxis muralis and Erucastrum sp.
[28].
Repetitive elements in cauliflower, mustard and radish, all belonging to Brassicaceae family, show 75%80% homologies [29,30].
Mehrotra et al.[31] recently reported that the pCtKpnI-I satellite repeat, initially isolated from Carthamus tinctorius and other species of Carthamus [31], is present in widely divergent families of angiosperms [32].
Various repetitive sequences from diverse taxa have been integrated into a database for easy accessibility.
PlantSat, a database specialized for plant satDNA, has integrated sequence data from several resources such as NCBI and DNAData Bank of Japan (DDBJ) [33], to provide a list of satDNA sequences for members of many plant families including Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae [3436], as well as many other plants.
Plant satDNA sequences commonly have monomer unit lengths of 135195 bp or 315375 bp, which are consistent with reports that the basic monomer units of plant repetitive DNA sequences correspond to the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosomal particle [10,33,37].
Different families of repetitive sequences show consistent presence of motifs like AA/TT dinucleotides, pentanucleotide CAAAA, etc.
The presence of conserved motifs in unrelated repetitive sequence families suggests their significance for molecular mechanisms underlying the amplification and maintenance of tandem repeats in a genome, and the determination of specific chromatin properties of loci containing the repetitive DNA [33].
The occurrence of short, direct and inverted repeats and short palindromes is a characteristic feature of various plant satellite families.
These may act as preferential sites for changes and as potential substrates for homologous recombination allowing rearrangements [3842].
The repetitive sequences have the nearest-neighbor characteristics with high frequencies of GG, AG and GA nearest neighbors [43], which originate during the repair of heteroduplex intermediates of the exchange [44,45].
Frequent occurrence of GGT and GTT trinucleotides in the monomers of repeat sequences makes the sequence suitable substrate for the de novo telomere synthesis in the repairing process of broken chromosome ends [46].
Another characteristic feature of repetitive sequences is methylation.
Methylation of DNA sequences is considered to trigger structural changes in DNA strands [21,22].
Methylation has been observed in satellite repeats following restriction analysis of genomic DNA with MspI and HpaI.
Methylation has been reported to occur in a 500 bp satellite repeat family in Arabidopsis [47], in a JNK repeat family in Japanese rye [21], in a pCtKpnI repeat family in Carthamus [31], and many other repeat families [26,48].
Functions of repetitive sequences Repetitive DNA sequences are present in the heterochromatin region.
Heterochromatin has been associated with several functions ranging from regulating gene expression to protecting chromosomal integrity.
Heterochromatin can incur different Table 1 Repeat DNA families in various plant species Species Repetitive sequence name Repeat length* (bp) Aegilops speltoides spelt-1 150 Aegilops squarrosa (DD) pAS1(Afa family) 336337 spelt-1 150 Allium cepa ACSAT 1/ACSAT 2/ACSAT 3 370 pAc074 314 Allium fistulosum pAfi100 380 Arabidopsis thaliana 180 bp repeat/HindIII repeat/AtCon/AtCen/ pAL1/pAS1/pAtMR/ pAtHR/pAa214/AaKB27 family 180 Avena pAm1 58 Beta vulgaris pAv34/pAc34/pRp34/ pRn34/pRs34 334362 pBVI 327328 pHC28 149 pHT30 140149 pHT49 162 ppHC8 162 pRN1 209233 pTS4.1 312 pTS5 153160 Brassica pBcKB4/pBT11/ HindIII family/Canrep 175180 pBo1.6 203 Brassica campestris BT4 296 BT11 175 CS1 88 CT10 213 pBcKB4 360 Brassica napus Canrep 176 Brassica nigra pBN4 459 pBNE8 1732 Brassica oleracea pBoKB1 360 Camellia sinensis pMST11 894 Centaurea HinfI 350 Citrus limon CL600 600 Crocus vernus pCvKB4 270 Cucurbita pepo 350 bp satellite 349352 Cucurbita maxima 170 bp satellite 168170 Cucumis melo HindIII repeat 352 Cucumis metuliferus pMetSat 346 Cucumis sativus Type I 182 Type III 177 Type IV 360 Diplotaxis erucoides Canrep 175180 Elaeis guineensis pEgKB15 355 pEgKB20 342 Elymus trachycaulus pEt2 337339 Glycine max SB92 92 STR120 120 Hordeum chilense pHch1 2.6 kb pHch2 2.1 kb pHch3 500 pHch4 2.6 kb pHch5 2.0 kb pHcKB6 339 Hordeum vulgare HvRT 118 pHvMWG2315 331 Leymus racemosus 350 bp family 350 Lt1 380 pLrAfa16 340 TaiI 570 Lycopersicon esculentum GR1 162 pLEG15 168 Table 1 (continued) Species Repetitive sequence name Repeat length* (bp) Medicago truncatula MtR1 166 MtR2/MtR3 183, 166 Musa spp.

Mehrotra S and Goyal V/ Repetitive DNA in Plants 167 levels of expression of adjacent genes during inheritance, because of either a position effect or juxta-position of heterochromatin and highly active genes, as observed in Drosophila and Saccharomyces [4952].
Repetitive sequences are implicated in numerous processes such as chromosome movement and pairing, centromeric condensation, chromosome recombination, sister chromatid pairing, chromosome association with the mitotic spindle, chromosome arrangement, interaction of chromatin proteins, histone binding, determination of chromosome structure, karyotypic evolution, regulation of gene expression and genome response to environmental stimuli and physiological changes.
These are all considered key components of evolutionary mechanisms and karyotypic differentiation [53,32].
Therefore, repetitive sequences play an important role in the evolution of species [54], and they are all speculated tomodel the regulatory patterns of genes leading to phenotypic variation [55].
The occurrence of species-specific satDNAenables rapid and reliable identification of species.
Grewal and Elgin [56] proposed the transcription of satDNA and its impact on heterochromatin, particularly in terms of the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin structure.
Repetitive DNA sequence elements are also involved in cooperativemolecular interactions for the formation of nucleoprotein complexes [57].
Repeat sequences may attract some specific nuclear proteins, and the chromatin folding code dictates the DNAprotein interactions, which may underlie the Figure 1 General distribution of repetitive sequences on plant chromo Distribution of different types of repetitive sequences is represented dia centromeric tandem repeats; blue, telomeric repeats; yellow, sub-telo dispersed repeats; white, genes and low-copy sequences.
genetic function of the tandem repeats [58].
Tandem repeats are proposed as tuning knobs in the evolution due to their ability to adjust the genetic hereditary traits and thereby facilitate the adaptation [59,60].Melters et al.[14] have suggested that tandem repeats at centromeres may promote the concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes owing to their high prevalence.
Centromere DNA transcripts have been reported to be involved in centromere structure and function [61].
It is speculated that if repetitive DNA is transposable, it may create novel genes [62].
The functions of satellite sequences are still not clear.
In the post-genomics era, due to a wealth of resources, it is possible to gain insights into the functional potential of repetitive sequences.
Evolution of repetitive sequences Repetitive DNA sequences exhibit cohesive and concerted evolution by mechanisms that cause continuous nuclear genome turnover and constitute molecular drive.
Such concerted evolution produces high homogeneity in a repetitive DNA family where mutations are diagnostic for species, and are the origin of interspecies genetic divergence [63,64].
satDNA exhibits internal sequence variability depending on the ratio between mutation and homogenization/fixation rates within a species [65].
Levels of sequence identity between the satellite repeats can be attributed by the following factors: the rates and biases of transfer between homologous and nonhomologous chromosomes, the number and distribution of repeats, the physical constraints within the genome, the generation time, the effective population size and various biological and selective constraints [66].
Tandem repetitive sequences are considered to be generated de novo by the combinatorial action of molecular mechanisms such as mutations, unequal crossing over, gene conversion, slippage replication and/or rolling circle replication [44,67], which create and maintain homogeneity of satDNA sequences within species [65,68].
Among them, sequence duplication by aberrant recombination [69,70] or replication slippage [67,71,72] represents the primary event in the formation of a repeat.
Unequal crossing over is assumed to be the primary evolutionary force acting on satellite sequences [44].
Arrays of satDNA are maintained by unequal exchange and intrastrand exchange [73] and unequal crossing over accounts for the alterations in copy numbers of satellite monomers [44].
Individual repetitive units do not evolve independently; instead, the arrays evolve in concert.
However, unequal crossing over, by itself, cannot create large tandem arrays of satDNA.
Gene amplification and subsequent duplications also play a significant role in satDNA evolution.
A few repeats may excise from a tandem array and circularize to provide a template for rolling circle replication [72], and after amplification into a linear array, the repeats may be inserted into a new location in the genome.

Red, meric tandem repeats; green, intercalary tandem repeats; brown, 168 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 164171 Repetitive elements are under different evolutionary constraints as compared to genes, and are considered as fastevolving components of eukaryotic genomes.
The high evolution rates of repetitive sequences can be used to differentiate related species [35,7478].
Hybrid polyploids are excellent models for studying the evolution of repetitive sequences [37], and variations in their repetitive sequences allow them to be used for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies [79].
Sequence homogeneity and evolution of repetitive sequences are correlated with their copy number.
Repetitive sequences with a low copy number are homogeneous and evolve slowly, whereas repetitive sequences with a high copy number are more heterogeneous and evolve quickly [80,81].
Sequence divergence in satDNA proceeds in a gradual manner due to the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions.
For instance, sequences were highly conserved in the repetitive satDNA of Palorus ratzeburgii and Palorus subdepressus [82,83].
In addition, high sequence conservation was also observed in human a-satDNA repeat, which is a rare and a highly-conserved repeat in the evolutionarily distant species such as chicken and zebrafish [84].
Similarly, the simple dodeca satDNA repeat is also conserved among evolutionarily distant organisms such as fruitfly, Arabidopsis and human [85].
Evolutionary persistence of large tandem arrays is affected not only by the balance between the rate of amplification and the rate of unequal exchange, but also by a wide range of mechanisms for recombination, replication and gene amplification.
However, the amount of bias in these processes acting on satDNA remains unresolved.
Nonetheless, natural selection does not have any effect on satellite repeats, because satDNA sequences are not transcribable and are consequently neutral to selection [6,7].
Evolutionary significance of repetitive sequences Repetitive sequences are speculated to influence cytoplasmic, cellular and developmental processes [86] by increasing genome size and affecting chromosomal recombination.
satDNA repeats represent recombination hotspots of genome reorganization [87].
The occurrence of satDNA in interstitial and telomeric heterochromatin reduces genetic recombination in adjacent regions [87].
Robertsonian chromosome fusion or fission, the joining of two telo/acrocentric chromosomes at their centromeres to form a metacentric, has been postulated to depend on sequence similarity of regions on the two chromosomes because of large amounts of centromeric, heterochromatic satDNA in eukaryotic genomes [88].
Satellite repeats in eukaryotes are likely involved in sequence-specific interactions and subsequently in epigenetic processes.
Nonetheless, repetitive satDNA also has a sequence-independent role in the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin.
Transcripts from tandem arrays or satellites are processed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and Dicer to produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [89,90].
satDNAderived siRNAs are probably involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation through the action of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [91].
Additionally, satDNA-derived siRNAs also have a possible role in gene expression and heterochromatin formation on tandemly-repeated noncoding regions, and in the expression of particular genes with embedded satellite repeats [92].
Recent advances and future perspectives A remarkable advance in the knowledge of repetitive sequences has occurred in recent years because of the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies.
These technologies can be applied to highly complex populations of repetitive elements in plant genomes, and have been used to characterize genomes and establish phylogenies based on repetitive sequences in Silene latifolia, Helianthus and Orobanche species [9397].
Various strategies such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and more sophisticated approaches are being developed to assemble NGS data and to analyze repeats for a better understanding of their contribution to gene function and genome evolution [95].
454 sequencing and Illumina platforms have been extensively used to comprehensively characterize repetitive DNA in the pea and olive genome as well as the satellite sequences in Silene, including the detection of the most conserved regions, reconstruction of consensus sequences of repeat monomers, identification of major sequence variants and designing of hybridization probes for localization on chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [93,97,98].
454 pyrosequencing was also used to detect copynumber repeats in the soybean genome [99] and to deduce the repeat composition of genomes for nine species of Orobanchaceae [94].
Recently, Sergeeva et al.[100] presented a detailed account of repetitive sequences of wheat based on 454 sequencing.Whole genome shotgun sequencing has also been employed to identify and analyze the most abundant tandem repeats from diverse animal and plant species [14].
Various web tools have been recently introduced for the analysis of repetitive sequences.
A tool called REViewer was developed for visualizing and analyzing repetitive elements [101].
A comprehensive toolkit RepEx was developed by Gurusaran et al.[102] for extracting various repeats (inverted, everted and mirror) from genomic sequences.
Recently, Novak et al.[103] introduced a collection of software tools called Repeat Explorer for characterizing repetitive elements and identifying high-and medium-copy repeats in higher plant genomes.
Repetitive sequences are technically challenging to clone and sequence and can be better studied by combining various approaches like mapping and sequence analysis.
Repetitive sequences also pose challenges in sequencing and assembling of genomes.
Cytogenetics, genomics and bioinformatics tools have allowed the genomes of complex eukaryotes to be investigated.
Whole genome resequencing studies, genome-wide analysis, transposon-based sequencing strategies and fine mapping of repetitive sequences can elucidate the structure, evolution, and functional potential of this enigmatic yet indispensable component of the genome.
This will in turn assist in sequencing and assembly of complex eukaryotic genomes.
