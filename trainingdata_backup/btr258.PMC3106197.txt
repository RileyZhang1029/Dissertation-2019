The success of whole-genome sequencing has led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences.
Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for userfriendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments.
Most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some specialized alignment software can also include WatsonCrick base pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data.
Therefore, we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural information.
Some features of BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of WatsonCrick and non-WatsonCrick base pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.

These are: (i) the incorporation of concepts introduced by the RNA Ontology, in particular the LeontisWesthof classification system for nonWatsonCrick base pairs (Leontis et al., 2002; Leontis and Westhof, 2001; Stombaugh et al., 2009), which are the building blocks of tertiary motifs (Nasalean et al., 2009); (ii) the annotation of specific regions within the structures (e.g.the P4 helix of RNase P), which can be used to support alternative notions of correspondence (sequence level versus structure level), including homology; and (iii) the ability to perform both horizontal and vertical collapsing of the alignment, allowing the user to focus on specific sequences or on specific regions of the alignment.
Several additional considerations that are especially useful for curating large databases of structured RNAs such as Rfam (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003), the RNase P database (Brown, 1999) and the tRNA database (Juhling et al., 2009) are (i) the functionality to dynamically score an alignment To whom correspondence should be addressed.
based on its ability to preserve features of a known structure, including non-WatsonCrick pairing and to highlight mismatches in a context, where the user can edit the alignment to resolve these mismatches; (ii) to visualize the secondary structure of any sequence within the RNA family based on the consensus secondary structure using standard tools that can be embedded in a web context (Darty et al., 2009); and (iii) to exploit recently discovered compositional p
