An important problem is the identification of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in promoter regions of potential TF target genes.
It is typically approached by position weight matrix-based motif identification algorithms using Gibbs sampling, or heuristics to extend seed oligos.
Such algorithms succeed in identifying single, relatively well-conserved binding sites, but tend to fail when it comes to the identification of combinations of several degenerate binding sites, as those often found in cisregulatory modules.
Results: We propose a new algorithm that combines the benefits of existing motif finding with the ones of support vector machines (SVMs) to find degenerate motifs in order to improve the modeling of regulatory modules.
In experiments on microarray data from Arabidopsis thaliana, we were able to show that the newly developed strategy significantly improves the recognition of TF targets.

1 INTRODUCTION One of the most important problems in understanding transcriptional regulation is the prediction of transcription factor target genes based on their promoter sequence.
A transcription factor binding site (TFBS) is a short sequence segment (10 bp) located near a genes transcription start site and is recognized by respective transcription factors (TFs) for gene regulation (Gupta and Liu, 2005).
TFBSs recognized by the same TF usually show a conserved pattern, which is often called a TF binding motif (Gupta and Liu, 2005).
Such binding motifs are typically identified through finding overrepresented motifs in promoter sequences of a set of genes that is enriched with targets for a specific TF.
The simplest approaches To whom correspondence should be addressed.
Present Address: Biology Department, Duke University, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27708, USA include the identification of overrepresented oligomers relative to a background model (Bailey and Elkan, 1994).
More sophisticated models include Gibbs sampling methods (Lawrence et al., 1993) that try to identify position weight matrices (PWMs), cf.
e.g.Schneider et al.(1986), which characterize binding sites in the candidate promoter sequences (Stormo, 2000).
Although these methods have been very successful for bacterial and yeast genomes, their success was limited in higher eukaryotes for which TF binding motifs are often degenerate and the search space is considerably larger.
While some recent techniques have improved the state-of-the-art, they all tend to fail if the motif is defined only weakly or found solely in the context of other motifs.
Despite these challenges, there are two possible redeeming factors: (i) many eukaryotic genomes have been or are being sequenced, and comparative genomic analysis can be extremely powerful; and (ii) most eukaryotic genes are controlled by a combination of factors with the corresponding binding sites forming homotypic or heterotypic clusters known as cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) (Gupta and Liu, 2005).
In this work, we want to exploit these redeeming factors and thus have developed novel methods that are able to classify genes as being either targets of the (combination of) TFs being studied or not, based on the presence of motifs and features capable of describing CRMs.
This was implemented as a two-step procedure.
We first used de novo motif finding tools or known motif databases like transfac (Matys et al., 2003) or jaspar (Sandelin et al., 2004) to identify a set of potential motifs.
Then, we used support vector machines (SVMs) employing a newly developed kernel, called the regulatory modules (RM) kernel, that is capable of capturing information about the motifs and their relative location to classify promoter sequences.
Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach to exploit conservation information to improve the classification performance.
Most previous approaches to discover CRMs are based on the identification of motifs and their co-occurrences, e.g.Frith et al.(2008) and Sinha and Tompa (2002).
Other approaches exploit site-clustering information with de novo motif discovery to build rules discriminating modules that preserve the ordering of motifs, e.g.Segal and Sharan (2005).
Finally, Yada et al.(1998) suggested to use hidden Markov models to represent CRMs and Gupta and Liu (2005) developed a Monte Carlo method 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ by-nc/2.0/uk/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

The main difference between our approach and most previous approaches is that we use discriminative methods to analyze CRMs, not just an individual TFBS.
In particular, instead of using zerothorder inhomogeneous Markov chains, we use support vector kernels to model higher order sequence information around candidate TFBS.
This manuscript is organized as follows: we start Section 2 by describing the basic methodology of classifying sequences with SVMs using standard sequence kernels.
It is followed by a detailed explanation of the main idea of this work in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, to combine de novo motif finders with state-of-the-art motif modeling.
In Section 3.2, we outline a problem derived from Arabidopsis thaliana microarray expression experiments, with loss or gain of function of certain TFs.
In our experiments, we first illustrate that the straightforward approaches cannot achieve reasonable results, while the newly developed methods are able to drastically improve the target gene recognition performance.
Finally, the article is concluded with a brief discussion in Section 5.
2 APPROACH SVMs are a well-established machine learning method introduced by Boser et al.(1992), to solve classification tasks frequently appearing in computational biology and many other disciplines.
Typical examples are the classification of tumor images or gene expression measurements, the detection of biological signals in DNA, RNA or protein sequences as well as the recognition of hand written digits or faces in images.
SVMs are widely used in computational biology due to their high accuracy, their ability to deal with high-dimensional data, and their flexibility in modeling diverse sources of data (Mller et al., 2001; Noble, 2006; Schlkopf and Smola, 2002; Schlkopf et al., 2004).
The goal of training an SVM is learning to label a dataset just like the training examples (x(i),y(i)),i=1,...,N. Here, x are the examples (sequences in our case), and y the labels.
For a two-class problem, labels are of the form +1 and 1, where the label +1 is assigned to a sequence x if it is part of the positive gene set, and 1 if it is part of the negative set.
After training, the classifier is able to assign such a labeling to any sequence.
If it is regulated by the same combination of TFs as the training examples, a correctly trained classifier will assign +1 to a sequence, otherwise 1.
The domain knowledge inherent in the classification task is captured by defining a suitable kernel function k(x,x), which computes the similarity between two examples x and x.
This strategy has two advantages: the ability to generate non-linear decision boundaries using methods initially designed for linear classifiers; and the possibility to apply a classifier to data that have no obvious vector space representation, for example, DNA/RNA or protein sequences as well as structures (Ben-Hur et al., 2008).
Twoclass SVMs use a maximum-margin hyperplane that separates the classes of the input vectors in the feature space.
We give an introduction to existing SVM kernels that work on sequences, like the weighted degree (WD) kernel.
Subsequently, we extend the WD kernel in two different ways: first, we consider an addition to use conservation information.
Second, given a list of potential motifs, we propose a new kernel that integrates information on the motif sequences with information about their co-occurrence with the aim to characterize RM.
2.1 Spectrum kernel Given two example sequences x and x over the alphabet , a simple way to compute the similarity is to count the number of co-occurring oligomers of fixed length.
This idea is realized in the so-called spectrum kernel that was first proposed for classifying protein sequences by Leslie et al.(2002): kspec (x,x)= spec (x),spec (x) , where || is the number of letters in the alphabet.
spec is a mapping of the sequence x into a ||-dimensional feature-space.
Each dimension corresponds to one of the || possible strings s of length and is the count of the number of occurrences of s in x.
This kernel is well suited to characterize sequence similarity based on oligos that appear in both sequencesindependent of their position.
If the classification of promoter sequences of genes as TF targets was solely based on binding to specific oligos, then the spectrum kernel would be a reasonable choice.
If the motif is less conserved, then allowing for mismatches or gaps can be beneficial (Leslie et al., 2003).
Note that this kernel is (by design) incapable of recognizing positional p
