Availability and Implementation: QuickGO has implemented in JavaScript, Ajax and HTML, with all major browsers supported.
It can be queried online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO.
The software for QuickGO is freely available under the Apache 2 licence and can be downloaded from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/installation.html Contact: goa@ebi.ac.uk; dbinns@ebi.ac.uk 1 INTRODUCTION The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org/) provides three detailed ontologies of terms describing the molecular functions that gene products normally perform, the biological processes they are involved in and the subcellular locations (cellular components) where they are located.
Associations between gene products and these terms are assigned by many biological databases providing detailed functional descriptions.
A single gene product may be annotated to multiple GO terms, detailing a range of functional attributes, using both manual and electronic annotation methods (distinguished by evidence code), with
