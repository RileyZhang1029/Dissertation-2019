ShortRead is provided in the R and Bioconductor environments, allowing ready access to additional facilities for advanced statistical analysis, data transformation, visualization and integration with diverse genomic resources.
Availability and Implementation: This package is implemented in R and available at the Bioconductor web site; the package contains a vignette outlining typical work flows.
Contact: mtmorgan@fhcrc.org High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies include Illumina (Solexa) (Bentley et al., 2008), Roche 454 (Torres et al., 2008) and other platforms.
These technologies produce millions of DNA sequences of tens to hundreds of nucleotides each.
Biological questions addressed with this data include SNP calling, ChIPseq (Mardis, 2007), and RNA-seq (Mortazavi et al., 2008).
We introduce the ShortRead package, part of the Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004) project.
ShortRead extends Bioconductor with tools useful in the initial stages of short-read DNA sequence analysis.
Main functionalities include data input, quality assessment, data transformation and access to downstream analysis opportunities.
ShortRead is an important gateway to use of Bioconductor for processing high-throughput DNA sequence data.
