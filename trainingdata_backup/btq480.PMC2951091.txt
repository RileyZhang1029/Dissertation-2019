However, there are alternative methods.
2Struc: The Secondary Structure Server has been created as a single point of access for eight different secondary structure assignment methods.
It has been designed to enable comparisons between methods for analyzing the secondary structure content for a single protein.
It also includes a second functionality, Compare-the-Protein to enable comparisons of the secondary structure features from any one method to be made within a collection of nuclear magnetic resonance models, or between the crystal structures of two different proteins.

Received on June 29, 2010; revised on August 13, 2010; accepted on August 14, 2010 1 INTRODUCTION In 1983, Kabsch and Sander (1983) developed what has become the de facto approach when defining secondary structure, the defined secondary structure of proteins (DSSP).
DSSP uses a single hydrogen bond energy term to assign eight states of secondary structure elements (SSEs) to three-dimensional coordinates and is arguably the golden standard for this task.
Although extensively used, DSSP is not the only tool available and other approaches have been developed which incorporate different means of defining SSEs.
It has been suggested that DSSP can miss the elucidation of edge strands (Martin et al., 2005) and has difficulties dealing with low resolution structures (Martin et al., 2005) and with structures where only the C trace atoms are reported (Labesse et al., 1997).
Further methods have been developed including DSSPcont (Anderson et al., 2002), STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995), PALSSE (Majumdar et al., 2005), P-SEA (Labesse et al., 1997), KAKSI (Martin et al., 2005), STICK (Taylor, 2001) and XTLSSTR (King and Johnson, 1999), the latter created for deriving secondary structure from threedimensional coordinates to match comparable data determined from circular dichroism spectra.
These other methods meet specific needs that are not optimally addressed by DSSP; all have merit, and as such broaden the means by which SSEs can be identified.
The aim of the 2Struc server is to provide easy access to the information produced by a variety of these SSE assignment tools.
To whom correspondence should be addressed.
Currently, eight methods are available on the server, covering all atom approaches such as DSSP, DSSPcont (an extension of DSSP using more detailed hydrogen bonding energies) and STRIDE, vector/line segment methods such as STICK and PALSSE and distance/angle methods such as P-SEA, KAKSI and XTLSSTR.
