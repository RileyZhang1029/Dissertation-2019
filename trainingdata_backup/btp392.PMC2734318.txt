With the introduction of SBML level 2 version 3, specific model entities, such as species or reactions, can now be annotated using ontological terms.
These annotations, which are encoded using the resource description framework (RDF), provide the facility to specify definite terms to individual components, allowing software to unambiguously identify such components and thus link the models to existing data resources.
libSBML is an application programming interface library for the manipulation of SBML files.
While libSBML provides the facilities for reading and writing such annotations from and to models, it is beyond the scope of libSBML to provide interpretation of these terms.
The libAnnotationSBML library introduced here acts as a layer on top of libSBML linking SBML annotations to the web services that describe these ontological terms.
Two applications that use this library are described: SbmlSynonymExtractor finds name synonyms of SBML model entities and SbmlReactionBalancer checks SBML files to determine whether specifed reactions are elementally balanced.

The annotation of models with the MIRIAM standard provides a number of significant advantages in the development of computational tools and applications that can reason over them (Kell and Mendes, 2008).
An example is the task of comparing or merging two biochemical models.
Before the introduction of MIRIAM, individual components of SBML models (Hucka et al., 2003) were identified solely by free-text, human-readable, name attributes, often resulting in equivalent components being named differently in different models.
As naming conventions are non-standard, it is impossible to definitively match these components computationally, and the process of model merging then requires human input to resolve ambiguities.
Providing MIRIAM-compliant annotations allows a component to be unambiguously identified by associating it with To whom correspondence should be addressed.

one or more terms from publicly available databases such as ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2008) or KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2000) (Fig.1).
2 FEATURES The species elements in Figure 1 are both annotated with MIRIAMcompliant terms.
libSBML (Bornstein et al., 2008) provides the facility for reading a given SBML elements annotation and hence could be used to determine that species1 and species2 are annotated with ChEBI term CHEBI:4167 and KEGG Compound C00031, respectively.
From this, it may be concluded that the compounds represented by these species are different.
However, manual inspection of the database
