Homology-based methods are well established and produce impressive results.
However, these are limited to structures presented by and resolved for natural proteins.
Addressing this problem more widely and deriving truly ab initio models requires mathematical descriptions for protein folds; the means to decorate these with natural, engineered or de novo sequences; and methods to score the resulting models.
Results: We present CCBuilder, a web-based application that tackles the problem for a defined but large class of protein structure, the helical coiled coils.
CCBuilder generates coiled-coil backbones, builds side chains onto these frameworks and provides a range of metrics to measure the quality of the models.
Its straightforward graphical user interface provides broad functionality that allows users to build and assess models, in which helix geometry, coiled-coil architecture and topology and protein sequence can be varied rapidly.
We demonstrate the utility of CCBuilder by assembling models for 653 coiled-coil structures from the PDB, which cover496% of the known coiled-coil types, and by generating models for rarer and de novo coiled-coil structures.

Advances here enable applications in protein folding, design and engineering, where sequence information needs to be translated to give insight into protein structure, function and mutation.
However, given the degrees of freedom inherent in polypeptide chains, the modelling of all potential structures that a sequence, even of modest length, could adopt is intractable computationally.
Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the structural space being searched and modelled.
Currently, this is done through comparative modelling (Mart-Renom et al., 2000), fold recognition (Lobley et al.2009; Wu and Zhang, 2008), fragment-based recombination (Rohl et al., 2004) or other methods of restricting conformational space (Rooman et al., 1991; Park and Levitt, 1995; Gibbs et al., 2001).
Another route is to define the space to be searched by structural parameterization of protein folds (Bowie et al., 1991; Koga et al., 2012; Ponder and Richards, 1987).
This becomes tractable (i) if there is a high probability that a sequence will fall into a broad class of protein structure; and (ii) if these 3D structures can be described mathematically to allow robust parameterization.
The-helical coiled coil is an example of such a protein fold where there are good broad-brush links between sequence and the overall structural class (Delorenzi and Speed, 2002; Lupas et al., 1991; Vincent et al., 2013).
Furthermore, the backbone architectures can be described by a small number of structural parameters (Crick, 1953a; Offer and Sessions, 1995).
Therefore, we have developed a tool for coiled-coil structures that uses parametric modelling.
Coiled coils are bundles of-helices in which component strands wrap around each other to form rope-like super-helical structures (Lupas and Gruber, 2005).
In the simplest cases, this is encoded by a relatively straightforward seven-residue repeating pattern of hydrophobic (h) and polar (p) amino acids, hpphppp (Woolfson et al., 2012), often assigned abcdefg (Fig.1a).
This patterning, combined with the 3.6 residues per turn of an helix, generates a hydrophobic stripe that spirals around each helix giving the interface between the component helices (Fig.1b).
The interface is packed tightly together through so-called knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing (Crick, 1953b) where the knob residue on one helix projects into a hole generated by a constellation of four residues on the partner helix (Fig.1c).
Despite the relatively straightforward sequence repeat and mode of packing, complexity arises because coiled coils are not limited to the common dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric oligomers: pentamers (Malashkevich et al., 1996), a decamer (Sun et al., 2014) and a dodecamer (Koronakis et al., 2000) are observed in nature, while there also exist a de novo hexamer (Zaccai et al., 2011) and an engineered heptamer (Liu et al., 2006).
Furthermore, within these gross architectures, the helices can be arranged in parallel, antiparallel or mixed topologies, and the assemblies can be homo-or hetero-typic (Lupas and Gruber, 2005; Testa et al., 2009; Moutevelis andWoolfson, 2009).
For the lower-order assemblies (24), oligomer state is largely dictated by the side chains that form the a/d interface (Harbury et al., 1993, 1994; Woolfson and Alber, 1995) and how they can pack*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The specification of oligomers above tetramer is less well understood, but it is clear that more complex sequence patterns than hpphppp are required (Woolfson et al., 2012).
In other words, we have a good understanding of how parallel dimers, trimers and tetramers are specified by natural sequences and how these can be made de novo; however, beyond these there is more to learn.
Although methods are available to model coiled coils (Crick, 1953a; Offer et al., 2002; Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011), these only generate the-helical backbones, which severely limits the modelling, prediction and design of coiled-coil structures.
This is because of the clear link between the make up of helixhelix interfacing residues and coiled-coil oligomer state (Harbury et al., 1993; Woolfson and Alber, 1995), i.e.a side-chain packing effect, which must be captured in models.
Our aim was to improve the modelling and design of coiledcoil sequences and structures and to develop a tool for nonspecialist to perform these tasks.
While the large database of known coiled coils has informed and allowed us to test our approach (Lupas and Gruber, 2005; Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009; Testa et al., 2009), coiled-coil proteins present considerable scope for generating completely de novo structures (Woolfson, 2005; Zaccai et al., 2011).
This illustrates further the power and potential of this type of structural parametric modelling.
We set out to create an application that could model as many coiled-coil architectures and topologies as possible, that is, those Fig.1.

(c) KIH packing, where the knob residue (usually a or d) from one helix (grey) projects into a hole created by four residues (black) on its partner (e.g.dgad or adea).
(d) The pitch parameter describes the distance (A) for a component helix to screw 360 around the super-helical axis.
(e) The radius of assembly is measured from the super-helical axis to the centre of a component helix.
(f) Interface angle, or 1, is measured as the angle between the vector from the super-helical axis to the helical centre and the vector from the helical centre to the C carbon of an a-position residue 3030 C.W.Wood et al., While &alpha; , ; Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009 ; observed already in nature plus those that are theoretically possible but currently without natural precedents.
To do this, we divided the problem into two parts: first, to generate backbone models for the many coiled-coil structures possible; second, to fit and score sequences onto these frameworks.
CCBuilder is a web-based application that generates complete (backbone and side chain) atomistic models of heptad-based coiled coils in conformations specified by the user.
Models are scored for feasibility with a measure of backbone strain, a test for KIH packing, and two atom-based forcefields.
A basic Builder mode is capable of modelling homo-and hetero-oligomeric coiled coils in parallel (up to 26 chains) and antiparallel (even numbered chains up to 26) conformations.
This covers 96.3% of coiled coils in CC+ (Testa et al., 2009) with 50% sequence redundancy.
Furthermore, an Advanced builder mode allows parameters to be specified for individual-helices around a super-helical axis, enabling some of the remaining more unusual coiled-coil conformations to be modelled.
It also presents opportunities for building models for the many as yet unobserved, but theoretically possible, coiled-coil structures.
2 METHODS 2.1 Application architecture CCBuilder has three main parts: a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), a coiled coil modelling component and a validation/scoring method.
The GUI is set up as part of a Linux, Apache, NoSQL/ MongoDB, Python/Django stack with a browser-based front end for collecting input parameters and returning the resultant models to the user.
As models are generated server side, modelling, validation and visualization can be performed on any device with a WebGL-enabled browser, including certain mobile platforms.
The GUI has a GLmol-powered molecular viewer (http://webglmol.
sourceforge.jp/index-en.html) to display the models generated (Fig.2a).
Beside this, there are six main tabs: Build, Log, Models, Interface, Plot and Information.
Build collects input parameters and displays model scoring.
It also has a list of example models based on known coiled-coil crystal structures (Table 1) as a guide for parameter selection.
Log gives a detailed list of energies per residue, which is useful for identifying clashes between side chains, as well as a full SOCKET (Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001) report to indicate if and where KIH interactions are made.
Models gives a history of the last 10 models generated and allows these to be rebuilt or downloaded by the user.
Interface allows the interface anglea parameter that defines the rotation of helices relative to the long axis of the coiled coil (Fig.1f)to be set graphically, easing parameter selection.
Plot displays a line graph of the Rosetta and Bristol University Docking Engine (BUDE) scores for the last 10 models generated.
The Information tab gives a brief guide to operation and a list of useful
