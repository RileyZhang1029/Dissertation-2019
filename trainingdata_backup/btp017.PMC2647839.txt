Stevenson1,2, 1Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 2Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, 1015 Lausanne and 3Institute of Microbiology, University Hospital, University of Lausanne, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland Received on September 16, 2008; revised on December 16, 2008; accepted on January 5, 2009 Advance Access publication January 25, 2009 Associate Editor: John Quackenbush ABSTRACT Summary: We present a tool designed for visualization of large-scale genetic and genomic data exemplified by results from genome-wide association studies.
This software provides an integrated framework to facilitate the interpretation of SNP association studies in genomic context.
Gene annotations can be retrieved from Ensembl, linkage disequilibrium data downloaded from HapMap and custom data imported in BED or WIG format.
AssociationViewer integrates functionalities that enable the aggregation or intersection of data tracks.
It implements an efficient cache system and allows the display of several, very large-scale genomic datasets.
Availability: The Java code for AssociationViewer is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence and has been tested on Microsoft Windows XP, MacOSX and GNU/Linux operating systems.
It is available from the SourceForge repository.
This also includes Java webstart, documentation and example datafiles.

1 INTRODUCTION Advances in genotyping platforms have enabled the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the human genome, which are intensively used to study the impact of genomic variation on phenotype.
Dedicated software like WGAViewer (Ge et al., 2008) was developed to facilitate the interpretation of results from early genome-wide association (GWA) studies.
Recent dramatic increases in array resolutionthe latest Affymetrix and Illumina arrays offer more than 1.8 M featureshave created a novel and immediate need for efficient and scalable visualization tools.
Scientists and clinicians strongly rely on such tools to interpret their results, while bioinformaticians need scalable applications to check the results from their high-throughput analyses.
In this context, we have developed AssociationViewer, a software tool for visualization of GWA studies in genomic context.
The program can efficiently handle large genomic datasets, is extensible to any genomic data To whom correspondence should be addressed.

represented in BED or WIG format and implements aggregation (union) or intersection of data tracks.
2 PROGRAM OVERVIEW 2.1 Cache and memory management With increasing data volumes, efficient resource management is essential.
One approach is to store the data in a cache with fast indexing mechanisms to retrieve the data, and to keep in memory only the information that is visualized.
We implemented such a system in AssociationViewer.
For comparison, loading a single dataset with 500 K SNPs in WGAViewer needs about 224 MB of RAM, whereas loading 10 different datasets (a total of 10 M data points) and displaying all genes on chromosome 1 needs only 50 MB in AssociationViewer.
2.2 Data import and export A typical GWA dataset consists of a list of SNPs with P-values derived from an association analysis.
In AssociationViewer, such data can be imported from PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) output or other text files.
Import of data in BED and WIG format is also possible (Fig.1C).
These formats are extensively used by the bioinformatics community and in the UCSC genome browser (Kent et al., 2002) to describe genomic and transcriptomic data.
BED describes gene features, whereas WIG allows representation of any single position associated with a score (Fig.1A1).
AssociationViewer allows export in WIG format (Fig.1F).
Window images can also be exported in many popular formats.
2.3 Annotation retrieval Gene and transcript data (Fig.1A3) can be downloaded from Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2007) and Biomart (Kasprzyk et al., 2004).
Tag SNPs can be retrieved from the Hapmap website (The International HapMap Consortium, 2007) (Fig.1D).
The user can choose to connect to Ensembl or HapMap releases for NCBI Builds 35 or 36.
2.4 Genome navigation and data interaction Navigation in AssociationViewer is intuitive (Fig.1A).
The user selects a chromosome either by clicking on the appropriate ideogram or via genomic coordinates.
