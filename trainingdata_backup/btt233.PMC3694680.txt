This process is highly controlled by cis-regulatory elements surrounding the cleavage/polyadenylation sites (polyA sites), which are frequently constrained by sequence content and position.
More than 50% of human transcripts have multiple functional polyA sites, and the specific use of alternative polyA sites (APA) results in isoforms with variable 30-untranslated regions, thus potentially affecting gene regulation.
Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying differential polyA p
