Using a strand-specific RNA-seq analysis, we compared the in vitro transcriptomes of these two Chinese isolates with that of a reference strain (P1/7).
In the 89K genomic island that is specific to these Chinese isolates, a toxinantitoxin system showed relatively high levels of transcription among the S. suis.
The known virulence factors with high transcriptional activity in these two highly-pathogenic strains are mainly involved in adhesion, biofilm formation, hemolysis and the synthesis and transport of the outer membrane protein.
Furthermore, our analysis of novel transcripts identified over 50 protein-coding genes with one of them encoding a toxin protein.
We also predicted over 30 small RNAs (sRNAs) in each strain, and most of them are involved in riboswitches.
We found that six sRNA candidates that are related to bacterial virulence, including cspA and rli38, are specific to Chinese isolates.
These results provide insight into the factors responsible for the difference in virulence among the different S. suis 2 isolates.
Introduction The Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) are Gram-positive bacteria and represent the leading cause of porcine diseases [1].
They can also infect humans that have direct contact with infected swine, causing meningitis, hearing loss and septic shock [13].
In China, two large-scale outbreaks of severe human infections of S. suis 2 were reported in 1998 and 2005, respectively [4].
S. suis 2 is also one of the major pathogens associated with bacterial meningitis in other Asian areas, such as Hong Kong and Thailand [57].
Therefore, it poses a significant threat to public health [8].
The known markers of S. suis 2 include capsular polysaccharide (CPS), muramidase release protein (MRP), elongation nces and Genic region 05ZYH3398HAH33 RNA-seq datasets Read mapping TARs Intergenic region DEG analysis P1/7 Homologous genes  COG & KEGG pathway analysis    Genes in 89K GI  Known virulence factors Novel protein coding genes  Novel sRNAs )mafR/mafP/IBCN( S. suis 2 transcriptome Figure 1 The pipeline for S. suis 2 transcriptome analysis Sequencing reads were first mapped to reference genome.

The capsule is one of the key factors involved in bacterial pathogenicity.
For instance, S. suis capsular polysaccharide inhibits phagocytosis through destabilization of lipid microdomains and prevents lactosylceramide-dependent recognition [9].
The capsule also protects the bacteria against phagocytosis.
The Ssa protein of S. suis 2, a surface-anchored fibronectin-binding protein, also facilitates epithelial cell invasion [7].
In bacteria, two-component systems (TCSs) are crucial devices that enable their adaption to changing growth conditions, and hence affect bacterial virulence.
More than 15 TCSs have been reported in S. suis 2 so far [4].
They are believed to facilitate bacterial adherence to mucosal epithelium cells, to participate in the process of capsular wall formation, and they have been shown to help bacteria survive and proliferate in in vivo mouse models [1015].
Moreover, other regions of the S. suis 2 genome may contribute to its virulence as well [16].
In 2007, Chen et al.sequenced the whole genomes of the Chinese isolates of two S. suis 2 strains 05ZYH33 and 98HAH33, which were involved in the two aforementioned outbreaks, respectively [4].
Comparison of the genomes of these two Chinese strains with that of the reference genome, P1/7, suggested that an 89K genomic island (GI) is responsible for the altered pathogenicity of the Chinese isolates.
Further analyses revealed that this 89K GI contains important virulence factors, including zeta toxin, TCS and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
Functional experiments revealed a dramatic decrease in the virulence of 05ZYH33 following the disruption of the TCS in the 89K GI [15].
Moreover, this 89K GI can be transmitted across different strains, and thus might represent a mechanism that enables S. suis 2 to adapt quickly to the local environment [17].
Although gene prediction methods have been widely applied in bacterial genome annotation, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology often reveals various novel transcripts, especially those belonging to the diverse small RNA (sRNA) families [18].
The regulatory role of these sRNAs in gene expression and in bacterial virulence is only now being slowly elucidated [1922].
Here, we provide the first RNA-seq datasets from two Chinese isolates of S. suis 2.
Results Transcriptome analysis pipeline and data statistics We performed a strand-specific sequencing of the in vitro transcriptomes of three S. suis 2 strains, including the two highlyvirulent isolates 05ZYH33 and 98HAH33, and the reference strain P1/7.

The regions with a single-nucleotide resolution sequencing coverage greater than 3 accounted for over 93%, 92% and 95% of the whole genome of the 05ZYH33, 98HAH33 and P1/7 strains, respectively (data not shown).
These percentages were similar to those previously reported for Bacillus anthracis (94%), Burkholderia mallei (95%) and Sulfolobus solfataricus (89.5%) [2325], demonstrating the reliability of our datasets.
Analysis of differential gene expression in homologous genes To compare the gene expression levels among the three isolates, we first identified their homologous genes (Materials and methods and Figure 1).
Overall, 1672 homologous genes were identified in the three stains, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using three software packages (Materials and methods).
In total, 318 genes were differentially expressed between 05ZYH33 and P1/7 strains, and 231 DEGs were identified between 98HAH33 and P1/7 strains.
There were 120 DEGs common to these two comparisons (Table S1).

Interestingly, most upregulated genes encode surface-anchored proteins, whereas the downregulated genes were enriched in the b-glucosidespecific phosphotransferase system (PTS) (Table S1).
The most downregulated gene in the Chinese strains was SSU05_1491/ SSU98_1502 (SSU1310, the homologous gene in P1/7), which encodes a transcriptional anti-terminator (Table S1).
The two Chinese isolates shared 246 additional homologous genes (not shown).

genes comparing with the reference isolate, eight were seen in both isolates.
For example, SSU05_0582/SSU98_0586 encodes the IS5 family transposase, whereas SSU05_0179/SSSSU98_ 0181 are exoprotein A genes from the RTX family and the encoded protein was reported to cause hemolysis [26].
Clusters of orthologous group analysis For all the genes annotated in previous studies, further scrutiny of the gene expression data revealed that 2092, 2094 and 1890 genes were identified with reads per kilo bases per million reads (RPKM) >1, which accounted for 92.8%, 92.9% and 94% of all genes in 05ZYH33, 98HAH33 and P1/7 strains, respectively.
Among them, 1737, 1712 and 1559 genes were annotated with known clusters of orthologous groups (COG) functions in 05ZYH33, 98HAH33 and P1/7, respectively.
A similar gene distribution in COGs was observed for all three strains (Figure S2), which indicates the similar biological processes can be observed in all three isolates.
To investigate the biological processes and show different activity in two Chinese isolates comparing with P1/7 isolate, we further analyzed the classification of the 120 aforementioned DEGs and found that 96 genes were classified into four major functional categories with 16 subgroups (Figure 3).
Among the homologous genes that were upregulated in the Chinese isolates, 15 were significantly enriched in the functional group of translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (P < 0.000005, Fishers exact test).
Meanwhile, among the homologous genes that were downregulated in the Chinese isolates, 22 significantly-enriched genes (P< 0.00000005, Fishers exact test) fall into the COG subgroup of carbohydrate transport and metabolism.

Although all three strains shared the species-specific components in the PTS pathway, fewer transcripts of the Man family genes were detected in 98HAH33 and 05ZYH33 (Figure S3).
Conversely, most Gk family genes except BgIF (PTS system, b-glucosides-specific II component) had more transcripts detected in the two Chinese isolates.
However, it is of note that BgIF is the most downregulated gene in PTS pathway, suggesting a reduced conversion from b-glucosides to phospho-b-glucosides.
In addition, the transcriptional level of the genes (SSU05_0398/SSU98_0384) responsible for transforming arbutin and salicin into arbutin-6p and salicin-6p, respectively, was increased, whereas the transcriptional activity of downstream 6-phospho-b-glucosidase (Enzyme Commission number: 3.2.1.86, encoded by SSU05_1489/SSU98_1500 and Table 2 DEGs in PTS and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways Strain Gene symbol Gene ID FC P PTS pathway 98HAH33 LacF SSU98_1051 3.05 P Pts/Crr SSU98_0384 1.92 P AgaW SSU98_1233 1.37 P UlaA SSU98_0191 1.38 H ManY SSU98_0439 1.43 P LacE SSU98_0210 1.49 P CelB SSU98_2074 1.62 P CelB SSU98_0712 1.66 P AgaE SSU98_1232 1.71 P ManZ SSU98_0440 1.80 P BglF SSU98_1501 6.74 P 05ZYH33 LacF SSU05_1038 1.11 P Pts/Crr SSU05_0398 1.56 P AgaW SSU05_1218 2.59 P UlaA SSU05_0189 1.77 P ManY SSU05_0451 2.19 P LacE SSU05_0212 3.43 P CelB SSU05_2071 1.67 P CelB SSU05_0713 3.26 P AgaE SSU05_1217 3.05 P ManZ SSU05_0452 2.33 P BglF SSU05_1490 5.40 P Strain EC ID Gene ID FC P Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway 98HAH33 2.7.1.69 SSU98_0384 1.92 P 3.2.1.86 SSU98_2083 1.02 A 1.1.1.1 SSU98_0274 1.63 A 1.1.1.1 SSU98_0275 1.92 B 3.2.1.86 SSU98_1500 6.14 B 05ZYH33 2.7.1.69 SSU05_0398 1.56 P 3.2.1.86 SSU05_2079 1.69 A 1.1.1.1 SSU05_0279 2.29 A 1.1.1.1 SSU05_0280 3.01 B 3.2.1.86 SSU05_1489 5.05 B Note: FC stands for fold change, which was calculated by log2 expression transferase system.

Therefore, their products arbutin-6p and salicin-6p may accumulate in the bacterial metabolites of the two Chinese isolates.
Differential expression levels of known virulence factors It is believed that two Chinese isolates are more pathogenic than P1/7 isolate, and we next analyzed transcriptional level of all known virulence factors in three isolates.
Our analysis indicated that these three isolates had 96 known virulence factors in common according to VFDB.
However, only the gene encoding ORF46-putative ABC transporter membrane protein (SSU05_0111/SSU98_0114/SSU0114, VFG1497) was highly expressed in the Chinese isolates; whereas expression of three genes including SSU05_0148/SSU98_0152/SSU0147, SSU05_1381/SSU98_1396/SSU0466 and SSU05_1387/ SSU98_1401/SSU1215, were downregulated (Table 3).

The KEGG analysis revealed that the ABC transporter pathway was enriched in the highly-expressed virulence factors in the 98HAH33 and 05ZYH33 (Table S2).
Furthermore, seven other virulence factors were found to be specific to the two virulence strains (Table 3).
For instance, The RPKM value of SSU05_1281/SSU98_1295 ranked the top among those of the seven factors.
SSU05_1281/SSU98_1295 encodes lipopolysaccharide 1,2-glucosyltransferase (RfaJ), which adds a glucose (II) group on the galactose (I) group of lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

Among them, 59 genes had P 3 sequencing reads recovered in the RNA-seq datasets.
The distribution of the RPKM values for all of these genes in the two strains showed that highest number of genes had RPKM values < 1, indicating a low transcriptional activity during in vitro culture (Figure 4).
Three known virulence factors specific to the Chinese isolates, including VFG0284, VFG2173 and VFG1453 (Table 3), were located in this GI as well.
Six genes with high transcriptional activity were seen in both strains (Table 4).
According to the STRING database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, http://www.string-db.org/), a signal recognition particle GTPase encoded by SSU05_0936/SSU98_0943 and a transcriptional regulator encoded by SSU05_0937/SSU98_0944 can form a toxinantitoxin (TA) system.

In all, over 50 novel transcriptionallyactive regions (TARs) were identified in intergenic regions of the two Chinese isolates (see Material and Method).
Most of them were homologous to genes that only encode hypothetical proteins (Table S3).
Only 9 and 8 TARs had homologous genes with known functions for the 05ZYH33 and 98HAH33, respectively (Table 5).
In particular, one TAR predicted to encode a toxin protein was identified in both isolates.
We also predicted 56 sRNAs in three isolates.

Discussion Known virulence factors contributing to the pathogenicity of S. suis 2 Although in vitro transcriptomes do not resemble in vivo ones, this analysis nonetheless illustrated the overall expression patterns for all the known virulence factors of S. suis 2 during in vitro incubation.

Zhang D et al/ Transcriptome Analysis of Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 273 relatively high transcription levels comparing to other virulence factors (Table 3).
In particular, although it was previously reported that inactivation of mrp is related to an increase in bacterial virulence [28], the two pathogenic strains had even higher transcription levels of mrp.
Glucose metabolism in bacteria not only reflects their priority for certain carbon sources, but also affects their virulence [29].
PTS functions as a sugar phosphorylating system and regulates diverse metabolic processes that affect the expression of many genes, especially those related to bacterial virulence [30].
In Listeria monocytogenes, the depletion of the mpt operon, which encodes the EII(t)(Man) PTS permease, resulted in increased expression of five genes in the prfA virulence gene cluster [31].
In this study, we observed the downregulation of four genes of the Man family in the PTS pathway, suggesting the involvement of the PTS pathway in changing the virulence of both Chinese isolates.
Downregulation of transcriptional anti-terminators may influence the virulence of the Chinese isolates In the PTS pathway, the most significantly downregulated gene was SSU05_1490/SSU98_1501 (BgIF).
In a recent study performed in Escherichia coli, BgIF has been shown to negatively regulate transcriptional anti-terminator proteins of the BgIG family [32].
Both Chinese isolates just have one gene that belongs to the BgIG family, SSU05_1491/SSU98_1502, with fewer transcripts identified compared to P1/7, rather than increased as predicted.
Therefore, there may be other novel proteins in the BgIG family or distinctive regulatory mechanisms in S. suis 2, which have yet to be discovered.
Nevertheless, previous studies showed that decreased activity of the transcriptional anti-terminator proteins might change the bacterial virulence [33].
For instance, the reduction in the expression of the transcriptional anti-terminator RfaH may increase the Ag43 expression level, and thereby stimulate biofilm formation [33].
The repressed transcription of SSU05_1491/SSU98_1502 indicates that some mechanism is responsible for the change in virulence in the two Chinese isolates.
Conclusion Here, we provided the first publicly-available RNA-seq data for three S. suis 2 isolates, and we highlighted the biological processes in the two highly pathogenic isolates, providing clues for mechanistic research.
Furthermore, our detailed lists of novel protein-coding genes and sRNAs provide candidates for further functional investigations, especially in the regulation of bacterial virulence.
Materials and methods Bacterial culture The three S. suis 2 strains 98HAH33, 05ZYH33 and P1/7 were obtained from Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Bacteria were grown in Todd-Hewitt Broth (THB) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with 2% yeast extract (THY) at 37 C. The growth rates and bacterial concentrations for all strains were determined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 600 nm each 60 min (Figure S6).
All isolates reached the log/exponential phase after incubation for 5 h. Transcriptome sequencing Total RNA was isolated from bacteria at log/exponential phase using the SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega), according to the manufacturers instructions.
Ribosomal RNAs were removed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for Gram-Positive Bacteria (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, WI).
Strand-specific libraries were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina GAII platform by the Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform at the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The raw sequencing datasets were uploaded to the NCBI SRA database (accession No: SRP043973).
Read mapping The sequencing read quality was evaluated using the FastQC tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/ fastqc/), and data saturation analyses were carried out using the RSeQC software [34].
Qualified reads (quality score > 20) were first filtered for ribosomal RNAs using the BWA software (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), and the rest were subsequently mapped to reference genomes of 98HAH33,05ZYH33 and P1/7.
The uniquely-mapped reads (MAPQ > 20) were used for further analysis.
In addition, the sequencing coverage for single nucleotide of the genome as calculated using the genomeCoverageBed in BEDTool [35].
Gene expression analysis for homologous genes Identification of homologous genes Protein sequences were analyzed to identify homology across the three isolates by using the Inparanoid software [36] and a pair-wise analysis was also performed to identify the homology between any two strains by using the MultiParanoid software [37].
Differential gene expression Based on the gene annotations in the database, the RPKM values were calculated for each gene using uniquely-mapped reads [38].
Raw read counts of genes were calculated by using HTSeq [39], BEDTools [35] and RSeQC [34].
Furthermore, DEGseq [40] was used to identify DEGs with the MARS model, with the criteria of fold change > 2 and P < 0.05.
Pathway analysis Candidate genes were first mapped onto functional groups in COG; Gene Oncology and KEGG pathway analyses were performed online using the DAVID software [41] (Fishers exact test, P < 0.05).
Virulence factor analysis Virulence factors were extracted from the virulence factor database (VFDB) [42].
A VFs.faa file was used for local blasting with BLASTP (v2.2.24, using default parameter with E 274 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 266275 value set as 1E5), and the top hits were used as candidates for further analysis.
Gene annotation of the S. suis 2 genome using RNA-seq data Identification of novel TARs in intergenic regions The sequencing depth for each nucleotide was first calculated, and a nucleotide was defined to be transcriptionally-active when its sequencing depth was higher than the lower deciles of the sequencing depth in the transcriptome.
Consecutive transcriptionally-active nucleotides form TARs.
In this study, TARs >70 bp in intergenic regions were further annotated [43].
Annotation of novel genes The DNA sequences for all novel TARs were blasted against NCBI Bacterial Genomes (all.ffn.tar.gz) for homology identification using BLAT.
The functions of the novel TARs in three S. suis 2 isolates were annotated based on the function of their known homologous genes in other bacteria.
Identification of sRNAs TARs without identified homologous genes were further compared with sRNAs in both sRNAMAP [44] using BLAT(V35) [45] and Rfam (11.0) using INFERNAL(1.1rc2) [46] to identify the potential sRNAs.
