BioJava contains powerful analysis and statistical routines, tools for parsing common file formats and packages for manipulating sequences and 3D structures.
It enables rapid bioinformatics application development in the Java programming language.
Availability: BioJava is an open-source project distributed under the Lesser GPL (LGPL).
BioJava can be downloaded from the BioJava website (http://www.biojava.org).
BioJava requires Java 1.5 or higher.

Details are available at1 INTRODUCTION BioJava was conceived in 1999 by Thomas Down and Matthew Pocock as an Application Programming Interface (API) to simplify bioinformatics software development using Java (Pocock, 2003; Pocock et al., 2000).
It has since then evolved to become a fully featured framework with modules for performing many common bioinformatics tasks.
The goal of BioJava is to facilitate code reuse and to provide standard implementations that are easy to link to external scripts and applications.
BioJava is an open-source project that is developed by volunteers and coordinated by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF).
It is one of several Bio* toolkits (Mangalam, 2002).
All code is distributed under the LGPL license and can be freely used and reused in any form.
BioJava is a mature project and has been employed in a number of real-world applications and over 50 published studies.
A list of these can be found on the BioJava website.
According to the project tracking web site Ohloh (http://www.ohloh.net/projects/biojava), the BioJava code-base represents an estimated 47 person-years worth of effort.

2 FEATURES BioJava contains a number of mature APIs.
The 10 most frequently used are: (1) nucleotide and amino acid alphabets, (2) BLAST parser, (3) sequence I/O, (4) dynamic programming, (5) structure I/O and manipulation, (6) sequence manipulation, (7) genetic algorithms, (8) statistical distributions, (9) graphical user interfaces and (10) serialization to databases.
Below follows a short discussion of some of these modules.
At the core of BioJava is a symbolic alphabetAPI which represents sequences as a list of
