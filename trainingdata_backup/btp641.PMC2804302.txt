Main capabilities include user data uploading and management, queries using a variety of criteria, visualization of results, interactive selections and seamless integration of users data with databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for functional annotations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes.

1 INTRODUCTION Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown to be powerful in investigating the effect of inherited genetic variations on risks of complex diseases (McCarthy et al., 2008).
Within the last 2 years, scientists have successfully replicated genetic risks of many complex diseases such as cancers, heart diseases and diabetes using GWAS.
As of this writing, there have been 325 published GWAS studies with 1500 SNPs that have been identified being associated with various diseases/conditions (Hindorff et al., 2009).
Though GWAS have shown some initial success, they also bring tremendous challenges to the community, not only in computations (i.e.hundreds of thousands of SNPs) and statistical analyses (e.g.multiple testing) but also in data management, access control, results visualization and sharing, integration with existing public resources (e.g.dbSNP, pubMed databases at NCBI) and interpretation of results.
In this article, we present a web application tool (Fig.1) named MAVEN, for Management, Analysis, Visualization and rEsults shariNg of GWA data using cutting edge technologies.
The current implementation of MAVEN (version 1.1) allows users to directly upload their own GWAS results to be stored in a relational database, and to search their data using powerful and user-friendly filtering capabilities.
MAVEN can conveniently assist genetic epidemiologists to visualize their GWAS results, to share results within their own group or with colleagues across the world.
MAVEN also integrates information about SNPs and genes directly from NCBI databases and provides direct links to detailed To whom correspondence should be addressed.

information of each selected SNP and/or gene, which will allow researchers to easily narrow down interesting candidate disease genes for further functional analysis.
None of the existing tools, including those recently developed ones (Aulchenko et al., 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2007; Hemminger et al., 2006; Purcell et al., 2007; Sole et al., 2006) that are specific for GWAS, have fully considered or incorporated all these features.
Almost all of these earlier tools focus primarily on data analysis such as quality control and cleaning, and single SNP-or haplotype-based statistical tests, which were greatly needed at earlier stages.
However, they provide limited, if any, functionalities on result sharing, visualization and integrations, which are also greatly needed at late stages of GWAS.
An exception is TAMAL (Hemminger et al., 2006), which provides some query functions about SNPs given a list of genes.
However, it does not integrate users data with online information.

[10:30 7/1/2010 Bioinformatics-btp641.tex] Page: 271 270272 MAVEN preparing the manuscript, we noticed a very recent tool named GWAS GUI (Chen et al., 2009), which also aims to visualize GWA results.
This provides independent evidence for the need of such tools.
In comparison to GWAS GUI, MAVEN has the advantage that all annotations of SNPs and genes have been either stored in local databases or can be accessed directly from NCBI through links provided by MAVEN.
In contrast, users themselves have to upload annotation information into GWAS GUI, which is difficult and tedious for many researchers in the epidemiology community.
Another major difference is that MAVEN is provided as a web server tool, which makes sharing of results among colleagues from different locations extremely easy.
In addition, MAVEN offers powerful filtering capabilities using different criteria, interactive selections, visualization of results and seamless integration with databases from NCBI.
2 FEATURES Data Managements: for the current implementation, MAVEN accepts and stores GWAS results based on single-locus analysis methods, not the raw data, which makes sharing less problematic in terms of privacy.
All data are stored and managed using a relational database management system.
The system allows users to upload their own results into MAVEN by preparing their analysis results in a tabular text format [e.g.output file of the program pLink (Purcell et al., 2007)].
Users can also submit other information such as descriptions of the study and
