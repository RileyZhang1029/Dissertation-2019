This knowledge would be particularly relevant for engineering thermostable enzymes.
In several experimental approaches, this issue has been serendipitously addressed.
It would be therefore convenient providing a computational method that predicts when a given protein mutant is more thermostable than its corresponding wild-type.
Results: We present a new method based on support vector machines that is able to predict whether a set of mutations (including insertion and deletions) can enhance the thermostability of a given protein sequence.
When trained and tested on a redundancyreduced dataset, our predictor achieves 88% accuracy and a correlation coefficient equal to 0.75.
Our predictor also correctly classifies 12 out of 14 experimentally characterized protein mutants with enhanced thermostability.
Finally, it correctly detects all the 11 mutated proteins whose increase in stability temperature is >10C.

In this respect, it is of great relevance developing a tool that can score protein sequences in order to screen thermostable mutants among a plethora of alternative mutated sequences (Hoppe and Shomburg, 2005).
The accumulation of genomic data, comprising thermophilic organisms, allows for a comprehensive investigation of nucleotidic and amino acidic sequences with the aim of discovering universal determinants of thermophilic life.
Many studies have attempted to correlate thermostability to both the genome and proteome compositions.
At the DNA level, differences in the codon usage between thermophilic and mesophilic organisms have been described (Lobry and Chessel, 2003; Lobry and Necsulea, 2006; Lynn et al., 2002; Singer and Hickey, 2002; Takami et al., 2004).
Recently, a codon frequency index could highlight robust determinants of thermostability capable of discriminating thermophilic from mesophilic genomes (Montanucci et al., 2007).
When residue composition in proteomes and/or protein sequences and structures were analyzed, the increased frequency in charged residues and ion pairs was recognized as the most remarkable feature of thermostable proteins (Farias and Bonato, 2003; Kreil and Ouzounis, 2001; Shure and Claverie, 2003; Szilgyi and Zvodsky, To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, many other compositional features may influence protein thermostability (see Zhou et al., 2008, for a recent review, and
