More and more of the resources offer programmatic web-service interface.
However, efficient use of the resources is hampered by the lack of widely used, standard data-exchange formats for the basic, everyday bioinformatics data types.
Results: BioXSD has been developed as a candidate for standard, canonical exchange format for basic bioinformatics data.
BioXSD is represented by a dedicated XML Schema and defines syntax for biological sequences, sequence annotations, alignments and
