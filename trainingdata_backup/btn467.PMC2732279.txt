Modeling transcriptional regulation using thermodynamic equations has become an increasingly important approach towards this goal.
Here, we present STREAM, the first publicly available framework for modeling, visualizing and predicting the regulation of the transcription rate of a target gene.
Given the concentrations of a set of transcription factors (TFs), the TF binding sites (TFBSs) in a regulatory DNA region, and the transcription rate of the target gene, STREAM will optimize its parameters to generate a model that best fits the input data.
This trained model can then be used to (a) validate that the given set of TFs is able to regulate the target gene and (b) to predict the transcription rate under different conditions (e.g.different tissues, knockout/additional TFs or mutated/missing TFBSs).
Availability: The platform independent executable of STREAM, as well as a tutorial and the full documentation, are available at http://bioinformatics.org.au/stream/.
STREAM requires Java version 5 or higher.

The frequency and duration of the binding events are influenced by the concentrations of the TFs, the binding affinities and location of the TF binding sites (TFBSs) in the CRM and the properties of the TFs themselves (e.g.effectiveness, competitive interaction with other TFs).
With the availability of an increasing number of detailed measurements of gene concentrations in different situations (e.g.tissues, developmental time points) as well as TFDNAbinding affinities, it has become possible to build mathematical models for transcriptional regulation.
Building mathematical models to associate a specific occupation of a specific CRM with an observed transcriptional response promotes a better understanding of the transcriptional regulation and enables in silico hypothesis testing about postulated regulatory TFs or mechanisms.
An increasingly successful approach to mathematically simulating transcriptional regulation is using thermodynamic models that model the interaction of TFs and DNA using kinetic equations.
To whom correspondence should be addressed.
Several such thermodynamic models have been proposed in the last years (Janssens et al., 2006; Segal et al., 2008; Zinzen et al., 2006).
These models take the CRM sequence, a set of TFs along with their concentrations and predict the transcriptional response of the target gene as mediated by the CRM and the TFs.
A training algorithm is used to optimize the models internal parameters to minimize the difference between the observed and predicted transcriptional response.
2 APPROACH AND USAGE Here we present STREAM, a Java-implemented framework to calculate and visualize transcriptional regulation using thermodynamic modeling approaches.
STREAM currently uses the thermodynamic model introduced by Reinitz et al.(2003), but the framework is flexible and can be used in conjunction with other models implemented in Java.
STREAM offers several optimization methods including gradient descent and simulated annealing for adjusting the internal parameters of the model to best fit the users input data.
To the best of our knowledge, STREAM is to data the only publicly available framework for modeling the regulation of the rate of transcription.
STREAM has been tested extensively on the even-skipped gene (eve) in Drosophila melanogaster (Bauer and Bailey, 2008).
STREAM can be executed using a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as via the command line.
The GUI is illustrated in Fig.1.
It offers the same functionality (e.g.multistart options of the optimization or automatic cross-validation evaluation) as the command-line tool, but in an intuitive and dialogue-based fashion.
Both the command-line and the GUI version can save the current result and settings of the program into a file, which makes saving and modifying previous experiments simple.
3 METHODS In order to generate a model for a particular target gene, the user must identify a set of putative TFs and a putative regulatory region.
The suspected role of each TF, x, as an activator xA or repressor xB must be specified by the user.
The program also requires measurements of the concentrations and binding p
