14.01.001 Abstract A biological molecule, e.g., an enzyme, tends to interact with its many cognate substrates, targets, or partners differentially.
Such a property is termed relative specificity and has been proposed to regulate important physiological functions, even though it has not been examined explicitly in most complex biochemical systems.
This essay reviews several recent large-scale studies that investigate protein folding, signal transduction, RNA binding, translation and transcription in the context of relative specificity.
These results and others support a pervasive role of relative specificity in diverse biological processes.
It is becoming clear that relative specificity contributes fundamentally to the diversity and complexity of biological systems, which has significant implications in disease processes as well.
Introduction Relative specificity is defined as the characteristic whereby in a biochemical system, a molecule, symbolized as E, interacts with its numerous substrates, targets or partners (collectively symbolized as {S}) differentially, thereby impacting them distinctively depending on the identity of individual substrates, targets or partners [1].
E can be a protein, RNA or any other biological molecule, capable of interacting with other molecules, i.e., {S}, through binding and/or catalysis.
Some examples are hemoglobin binding to O2, CO2 and a few other ).

In many cellular systems, {S} can number in the hundreds, thousands or more.
Research, however, has traditionally been centered on determining whether a molecule is the substrate or not of an E of interest.
For various reasons, that an E might not target all of its {S} equally in complex systems, i.e., relative specificity, is rarely treated as default, and what physiological consequences relative specificity may incur is even less investigated [1].
Evidence does exist to suggest that relative specificity is functionally relevant in complex biochemical systems.
For example, the RNase Drosha (E) cleaved hundreds of human primary microRNA transcripts ({S}) with different efficiencies in vitro, which correlated with the expression of mature microRNAs in vivo, and such specificity was partially explainable by the structural properties of {S} [2].

The phenomena were generalized to formulate the relative specificity hypothesis, which has a number of features and implications.
Firstly, it focuses on complex systems where an E acts on many, e.g., hundreds or thousands of substrates, since such systems are abundant in nature, yet their relative specificity has been largely ignored partially due to technical limitations.
Testing the hypothesis requires that we examine and compare the interactions between an E and its numerous substrates and then correlate the preferential interactions with a phenotype, in order to filter out the effects from factors other than the E of interest and make credible
