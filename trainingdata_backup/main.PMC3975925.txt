Abstract The miR-15/107 family comprises a group of 10 paralogous microRNAs (miRNAs), sharing a 50 AGCAGC sequence.
These miRNAs have overlapping targets.
In order to characterize the expression of miR-15/107 family miRNAs, we employed customized TaqMan Low-Density micro-fluid PCR-array to investigate the expression of miR-15/107 family members, and other selected miRNAs, in 11 human tissues obtained at autopsy including the cerebral cortex, frontal cortex, primary visual cortex, thalamus, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach and skeletal muscle.
miR-103, miR-195 and miR-497 were expressed at similar levels across various tissues, whereas miR-107 is enriched in brain samples.
We also examined the expression patterns of evolutionarily conserved miR-15/107 miRNAs in three distinct primary rat brain cell preparations (enriched for cortical neurons, astrocytes and microglia, respectively).
In primary cultures of rat brain cells, several members of the miR-15/107 family are enriched in neurons compared to other cell types in the central nervous system (CNS).
In addition to mature miRNAs, we also examined the expression of on PT).

Our data suggested a generally poor correlation between the expression of mature miRNAs and their precursors.
In summary, we provide a detailed study of the tissue and cell type-specific expression profile of this highly expressed and phylogenetically conserved family of miRNA genes.
Introduction MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that are expressed in all known plant and animal cells.
MiRNAs are estimated to regulate the translation of well over half the transcripts in the human genome [13].
Derived from a larger RNA precursor (pri-miRNA), the miRNA transcript is processed in a multistage sequence, culminating in the cleavage of a short hairpin RNA to form a mature 22 nucleotide miRNA [4].
In animal species, miRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, via imperfect sequence complementarity with target mRNA, which results in either mRNA translational suppression or degradation [5].
An essential regulatory portion of mature miRNA is the seed region near the 50 end of a miRNA [1,6].
The focus of the current study is a group of paralogous, evolutionarily-conserved miRNAs termed the miR-15/107 family [79].
This group of miRNAs shares a sequence (AGCAGC) near the 50 end [7] that complements with an overlapping list of mRNA targets [10,11].
Members of the miR-15/107 family play key roles in gene regulation involved in cell division, metabolism, stress response and angiogenesis [7].
The miR-15/107 group has been implicated in pathological processes including cancers, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases.
While all vertebrates examined to date express miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-103 and miR-107, only mammals are known to express miR-195, miR-424, miR-497, miR-503, whereas miR-646 appears to be humanspecific [7].
Among the key characteristics of any miRNA are the types of tissues and cells where a specific miRNA is expressed.
Thus, miRNA expression profiling is an essential tool for understanding which genes are transcribed (pri-miRNAs) and processed to mature miRNAs in various organs and cells.
Although there have been prior expression profiling studies of miRNAs in human tissues (see below), the particular expression profiles of all miR-15/107 family genes have not been thoroughly described either in human tissues or in terms of the specific cell types of the central nervous system (CNS).
To address this, we examined and here report on the expression of miR-15/107 miRNAs in both human tissues and in individual cell types of the cultured rat brain cell preparations.
This study also presents data using a relatively novel RT-qPCR-based method for miRNA quantitation.
Results miR-15/107 family miRNAs are highly expressed in human brain with overlapping targets Mature miRNAs of miR-15/107 family share a sequence (AGCAGC) near the 50 end (Figure 1A), and multiple family members are expressed at high levels in the human brain tissue (Figure 1B).
Analysis of RNA deep sequencing data generated from human brains [12] revealed that miR-15/107 family accounts for 1.52.0% of total miRNA reads in the temporal neocortex (Brodmann areas 21/22) gray matter of non-demented control brains.
From RNA isolated from these human brain samples, miR-16, miR-103, miR-107 and miR-497 are the most highly expressed miRNAs among the family members.
Biochemical identification of miR-16, miR-103, miR107 and miR-497 targets in H4 glioneuronal cell line showed that these miRNAs share high degrees of overlap in targets (Figure 1C) with 20% of mRNA targets shared by all 4 miRNAs.
Multiple mature miRNAs of miR-15/107 family members show robust expression in different human tissues A custom designed PCR-array panel was used, including 10 miR-15/107 members and the other 10 selected miRNAs (Table S1) to profile the miRNA expression from 11 human tissues.
Demographic information on the human autopsied cases is provided in Table S2.
Relatively high levels of miRNA expression were observed across different human tissues with PCR Ct values ranging from 15 (miR-16) to 35 (miR-646) (Figure 2) in some tissue samples.
Hierarchical clustering (Pearsons correlation-Average Linkage) based on the similarity of miRNA expression patterns of the 11 tissues demonstrated that similar anatomical tissues were generally clustered together.
For example, cerebral cortex, frontal cortex and primary visual cortex showed similar miRNA expression pattern, resulting in close clustering; similarly, heart and skeletal muscle samples demonstrated similar expression patterns.
The heat map also showed a clustering of miRNA expression pattern for a given tissue type (between cases), indicating an organ-specific expression pattern.
For detailed quantitative data, see Tables S3 and S4.
Further analysis revealed a distinct expression profile of brain-enriched miRNAs (Table 1 and Figure 3).
For example, miR-124a, a known brain-enriched miRNA, was strongly expressed in brain tissues as expected with lower levels of expression in the kidney, spleen and skeleton muscle samples (expression marked as undetectable when Ct > 35).
miR107 was also shown to be enriched in brain tissues (3.25-fold, P < 0.0001).
Similarly miR-103 and Let-7a tended to be expressed at higher levels in brain tissues, whereas miR-16, miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-424, miR-497, miR-503, miR-646 and other non-miR-15/107 miRNAs (miR-20a, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-27b, miR-30d, miR-143) tended to show higher expression in non-brain tissues (Figure 3 and Table 1).
Comparison of miRNA expression among individual tissue types showed that miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 were enriched in the spleen, miR-424 was expressed relatively high in the kidney, liver and skeletal muscle, and miR-646 was enriched in the kidney.

C. Biochemical identification of miR-16, miR-103, miR-107 and miR-497 targets according to methods previously published [49,50] revealed extensive but non-identical overlapping targets in H4 cells.
This not only shows the importance of the seed regions, but also indicates that non-seed portions of the miRNAs are important as well.
In this assay, 18,761 mRNAs were not targeted by any of these miRNAs.
Wang WX et al/ Expression of miR-15/107 Family 21 Members of the miR-15/107 family are enriched in neurons The expression of miR-15/107 family miRNAs was evaluated in different brain cell types.
Primary rat neuron, astrocyte and microglia cultures were obtained from rat pups at embryonic day 18 (E18) (see Materials and methods).
The cell-type enriched cultures were verified by Western blot analysis using antibodies against cell-type specific markers (Figure 4).
The expression of all tested miRNAs was different between neuronal (cerebral cortical neurons) and non-neuronal (cerebral cortical astrocytes and microglial) cells (Figures 5 and 6, Table 2).
In contrast, astrocytes and microglial share relatively similar expression profiles (Table 2).
Specifically, 4 members of the miR-15/107 family (miR-103, miR-107, miR-195 and miR-497) were among the neuron-enriched miRNAs (>2-fold enriched for each, P < 0.05).
Other neuron-enriched miRNAs include miR-124, miR-20a, miR-320 and Let-7a miRNAs (Figures 5 and 6, Table 2), whereas miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-143 were glial-enriched (both P < 0.05).
Expression of pri-miRNAs is correlated relatively weakly with that of mature miRNAs in miR-15/107 family Diverse expression profiles were found for miRNA precursors (pri-miRNA) in human tissues (Figure 7 and Table S5).
The expression of miR-124 precursor was exclusively identified in the brain tissues, which is well correlated with its neuronal expression characteristics.
In contrast, miR-23a precursor was expressed at relatively high levels in non-brain tissues (Table 3).
Correlations between expression of the fully processed (22 nt, i.e., mature) miRNA and precursor transcript expression were generally not strong for most miRNAs (Table 4 and Figure S1).
Among the 23 miRNAs tested, miR-124, a brain and neuron-specific non-miR-15/107 family miRNA, showed the strongest correlation (R2 = 0.9189) between precursor and mature miRNA.
The mature miR-103 can potentially be generated from two primary miRNA transcripts that are encoded from different chromosomes [13].
The array data showed that expression of mature miR-103 shows a tighter correlation with miR-103a-2 precursor (hsamiR-103a-2-Hs03302758_pri, Table 4 and Figure S1), which was expressed at relatively high levels across all tested tissues.
The expression levels of miR-103a-2 precursor were higher than that of miR-103a-1 (fold increase of 1.872.8, Table 5).
These data indicate that mature miR-103 in humans appears to be mainly generated from miR-103a-2 precursor that resides in PANK2 gene.
We also examined the expression of some non-miR-15/107 miRNA genes.
The human miR-29 family includes three mature members, miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-29c, that are encoded by two gene clusters.
The gene encoding the precursors of both miR-29b-1 and miR-29a is located on Chromosome 7, whereas the coding gene for both miR-29b2 and miR-29c is on Chromosome 1 [14].
Among the three Figure 2 Hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression in human tissues Ct values of each assay were normalized using the global mean method.
The average linkage of the clustered group was calculated using the Pearsons correlation method.

22 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 1930 miR-29 precursor transcripts tested (due to limited number of gene spots on the array card, miR-29b-2 was not included), primary miR-29b-1 (hsa-miR-29b-1-Hs03302748_pri) seemed to be the major expresser in most tissues (Table S6).
In contrast to much higher levels of mature miR-29a and miR-29c, expression of miR-29a precursor was not detected (Ct > 40) in the kidney, liver and spleen; likewise, expression of miR29c was not detected in lung and spleen.
This is interesting because miR-29a and miR-29b-1, like miR-29b-2 and miR29c, are apparently co-transcribed as polycistronic primary transcripts [15].
Discussion Here we report for the first time a systematic expression analysis of all miR-15/107 genes in various human tissues and in different rat CNS cell types.
Individual members of the miR15/107 group are expressed at medium-to-high levels across many tissue types but there is some tropism in terms of both tissue-and cell type-specific expression.
While these data provide novel results about the expression of miR-15/107 genes, there is not, among these miRNAs, a sharply tissue-or cellspecific miR-15/107 gene.
Since miR-15/107 miRNAs (like many other miRNAs that have co-evolved with paralogs) coexist alongside highly-expressed miRNAs with overlapping targets [7,16], these data provide support to the idea that it is necessary to take into account the expression and activities Fold increase > 2, P < 0.05 Fold change < 2 or P > 0.05Fold decrease > 2, P < 0.05 Le t-7 a m iR-1 03 m iR-1 07 m iR-1 24 a m iR-1 43 m iR-1 5a m iR-1 95 m iR-2 0a m iR-2 3a m iR-2 7a m iR-2 7b m iR-2 9b m iR-2 9c m iR-3 0d m iR-3 20 m iR-4 24 m iR-5 03 m iR-4 97 m iR-1 5b m iR-1 6 m iR-2 9a m iR-6 46 Le t-7 a m iR-1 03 m iR-1 07 m iR-1 24 a m iR-1 43 m iR-1 5a m iR-1 95 m iR-2 0a m iR-2 3a m iR-2 7a m iR-2 7b m iR-2 9b m iR-2 9c m iR-3 0d m iR-3 20 m iR-4 24 m iR-5 03 m iR-4 97 m iR-1 5b m iR-1 6 m iR-2 9a m iR-6 46 Le t-7 a m iR-1 03 m iR-1 07 m iR-1 24 a m iR-1 43 m iR-1 5a m iR-1 95 m iR-2 0a m iR-2 3a m iR-2 7a m iR-2 7b m iR-2 9b m iR-2 9c m iR-3 0d m iR-3 20 m iR-4 24 m iR-5 03 m iR-4 97 m iR-1 5b m iR-1 6 m iR-2 9a m iR-6 46 Figure 3 Expression profiles of miRNAs in different human tissues Levels of miRNA expression in each individual tissue were calculated as fold difference against the other tissues examined.

Wang WX et al/ Expression of miR-15/107 Family 23 of paralogous miRNAs, rather than just focusing on individual miRNAs in isolation.
There are some technical caveats to our study.
Much of the data derive from human subjects who came to autopsy.
This experimental approach introduces potential biases such as those related to agonal events, comorbidities and ascertainment/recruitment bias.
RNA from autopsy specimens can also be degraded.
An alternative approach would have been to use surgical pathologic specimens from multiple different individuals.
This approach would have introduced a separate but overlapping list of potential pitfalls such as epiphenomena linked to surgery (anesthesia-related RNA expression changes), additional inter-individual variability and strong ascertainment biases.
For example, persons undergoing stomach surgery differ systematically from those undergoing liver surgery.
Faced with the alternatives, using autopsy material is defensible, but the data should be analyzed with caution in light of these concerns.
In addition to the pre-analytical potential challenges, researchers from many laboratories have now found that miRNA profiling results obtained using different platforms can vary dramatically for individual miRNAs despite good overall inter-platform correlation [1721].
Keeping the technical challenges in mind, our data provide new insights into the expression of the miR-15/107 gene family in humans.
A straightforward observation is that the miRNAs with highest expression in human tissues (miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-103, miR-107 and miR-195) all include a 7-nt common sequence: AGCAGCA (Figure 1).
Our study is not able to assess different developmental stages where alterations are known to occur in terms of miR-15/107 family member expression.
For example, miR-15 and miR-16 expression correlates to particular stages in erythropoiesis [22,23].
Assessing archival human brains that had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, we found that miR-16 expression is highly expressed during early human brain development [24].
The current study confirms some of the prior observations with regard to miR-15/107 expression profiling experiments: gene expression among miR-15/107 group members Table 2 Relative expression of miRNAs in primary rat neuronal and microglial cultures miRNA Microglia Neurons Fold change P value Fold change P value hsa-let-7a 0.781 0.023 1.880 0.028 hsa-miR-103 1.450 0.062 3.270 0.029 hsa-miR-107 0.840 0.383 4.020 0.005 hsa-miR-124a 2.900 0.137 8541.360 0.001 hsa-miR-143 0.036 0.028 0.008 0.003 hsa-miR-15a 1.240 0.428 2.050 0.021 hsa-miR-15b 0.441 0.112 1.140 0.333 hsa-miR-16 1.380 0.175 2.240 0.006 hsa-miR-195 0.208 0.009 1.490 0.183 hsa-miR-20a 1.150 0.244 5.320 0.001 hsa-miR-23a 1.710 0.001 0.114 0.000 hsa-miR-27a 1.320 0.137 0.123 0.002 hsa-miR-27b 1.370 0.310 0.599 0.097 hsa-miR-29a 0.926 0.298 0.091 0.003 hsa-miR-29b 1.460 0.009 0.093 0.014 hsa-miR-29c 1.270 0.110 0.311 0.134 hsa-miR-30d 4.910 0.006 3.130 0.009 hsa-miR-320 0.379 0.001 1.430 0.101 hsa-miR-424 0.746 0.428 0.676 0.333 hsa-miR-497 0.071 0.023 2.670 0.000 hsa-miR-503 1.500 0.298 0.971 0.953 Note: Expression of miRNAs in cultured rat neurons or microglial cells is normalized to that in astrocyte preparation and presented as fold changes.

24 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 1930 tends not to be purely specific to particular tissues or cell types.
Furthermore, despite the caveat that Ct values of qPCR analyses cannot be confidently compared across transcripts, in humans the highest-expressing miRNAs tend to be miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-103 and miR-107.
The more recently evolved miRNAs (miR-424 and the primate-specific miR-646) show relatively low expression but the mammal-specific miR-195/miR-497 (physically close to each other on Chromosome 17) have moderate expression levels.
There has been inconsistency among prior studies in terms of miR-15/107 gene group member expression profiling in mammals, possibly due to technical issues.
A subset of these miRNA genes has been detected in mammalian tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, brain, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and placenta [2531].
There may be similar expression profiles among some group members across human tissues (miR-15, miR-16 and miR-195) [27], although some but not all studies have indicated that miR-15/miR-16 expression is relatively high in hematopoietic cells including T lymphocytes [25,26,28,3235].
We found evidence to support miR-107 expression tropism for the human brain, and also rat neurons versus other cell types.
Prior studies have provided mixed perspectives on whether miR-107 levels are highest in brain [27 29,31,3537].
The complexity of this situation is illustrated in a study of embryos from different species using miRNA in situ hybridization, finding that miR-107 is essentially brain-specific in the Japanese killifish, highly expressed in almost all tissues in chicken, but neither pattern is observed in mouse [38].
Assessment of pri-miRNA levels using qPCR provided a new perspective on the rather poor correlation between levels of mature miRNAs and their precursors.
This basic observation had been made previously by others in the context of miR-103 and miR-107 precursors [37] in mice tissues.
We also note that miR-103a-2 appears much more highly expressed than miR-103a-1 in all human tissues, suggesting that this gene is the more transcriptionally active source of mature human miR-103.
The discordant correlations of miRNA and the precursor were also reported for other miRNAs [39].
These observations confirm the importance and regulatory relevance of the processing steps of miRNA biogenesis.
In contrast to the generally discordant correlation between levels of detected precursor and mature miRNA, expression of miR-124 seems to be highly correlated between mature and precursor the brain-specific expression of miR-124a [40] has been demonstrated previously [39,40].
One key point that is strongly underscored by our data is that in a paralogous miRNA family, the cumulative impact of those miRNAs must be addressed rather than only focusing on one single gene family member.
In other words, since miR-15/107 miRNAs have highly overlapping targets [7,16,41], and multiple members of the gene family are transcribed at constitutively high levels, any therapeutic or diagnostic method based on one family member must also take into account the biological activities of other family members.
We conclude that this added level of complexity, related to multiple paralogs with overlapping targets, is particularly important in miR-15/107 family of miRNAs.
TaqMan assays developed for miRNA detection and validation proved to be sensitive and easy to use [42].
The more recent TaqMan PCR-array platform is a reproducible methodology in miRNA profiling with a broad dynamic range.
In this study, we used TaqMans Low Density Arrays (TLDA) which is a medium-throughput method of real-time RT-PCR array.
This system offers flexibility to tailor the probe groups, such as the one we employed here for miR15/107 family profiling.
There is a persistent challenge of normalization in miRNA expression studies across cell types and tissues [4347].
We hypothesize it may not be possible to find a one size fits all normalization method.
Although the custom array card included internal controls (U6 and RNU66 for mature miRNAs; beta-actin and GAPDH for the precursors) in the panel, we could not rely on these controls to normalize the data because of the substantial variability of these genes expressed in tissues and cells (Tables S3, S4 and S5).
In mature miRNA panels, the standard deviations for U6 and RNU66 are 2.1 and 2.5 Ct, respectively (equivalent to 4.3-and 5.7-fold difference); and in the miRNA precursor panel, the standard deviations for beta-actin and GAPDH Tau NeuN GFAP(poly) Iba-1-Acn Neuron Astrocyte Microglia Figure 4 Western blot verification of different primary rat brain cell cultures Cell lysates of primary rat cell preparations enriched for cortical neurons, astrocytes or microglia cells were separated on SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.

The global mean normalization method [48] used in our dataset appeared to represent a best fit for the dataset after further validation on selected individual miRNAs.
When normalizing TLDA data, one should take into consideration the careful choices of specific internal controls for normalization to avoid technical bias.
Materials and methods High-throughput method for miR-15/107 target identification Experiments were performed as described in detail previously [49,50].
Briefly, H4 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured under the vendors recommended conditions.

Primary cortical neuronal culture, primary astrocyte and microglial cultures (all are cell-type enriched, rather than pure preparations) were generated from SpragueDawley rat pups at E18 as described in [51,52].
All primary cell cultures were maintained at 37 C in humidified, CO2 (5%) incubator.
RNA isolation Total RNA was extracted from human tissues or primary rat neuron, astrocyte and microglia cells using TRIZOL LS reagent (Life Technologies, USA) following the modified procedure described previously [18,47].
Western blot analysis Conventional SDSPAGE and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [11].

miR-15/107 family profiling We employed TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) quantitative RTPCR assays (Life Technologies) to study miRNA expression.
Two panels of 24 assays each (Table S1) for mature miRNAs and their precursors including two endogenous controls (mammalian U6 and RNU66 for mature miRNA panel; beta-actin and GAPDH for the precursor panel), 10 members of miR-15/107 family and 12 other selected miRNAs, were custom prepared as an 8 24 array format (384 wells with 8 samples 24 duplicate assays in each array card).
Specific stemloop primers for each mature miRNA were pooled and supplied by Life Technologies for reverse transcription (RT) reactions.
Total RNA (100 ng) was used for cDNA synthesis.
For mature miRNA array, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies) with the pooled specific stem-loop primers.
For miRNA precursor array, total RNA was first subjected to DNase treatment using Ambion TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies).
The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Life Technologies).
The resulting cDNAs served as templates for RT-qPCR profiling.
PCR reaction mixtures for individual samples were transferred into the loading port on the customized TLDA cards (mature miRNA card, or precursor miRNA card), and loaded to each well by spinning the array card in a centrifuge according to the manufacturers instructions.
The card was then sealed and PCR was performed using ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) with the following program: hold 2 min at 50 C, followed by 10 min at 95 C, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 C and 1 min at 60 C. Data analyses qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) raw data were processed with ViiA 7 RUO software (Life Technologies) excluding data that failed QC.
miR-646 was removed from primary cell data set analysis, since mature miR-646 was not expressed in rat.
We also removed the control RNU66 from the rat data set because it was amplified poorly (data not shown).
As with the precursor panel, hsa-mir-92a-1 (precursor for miR-20a) was also excluded from analysis due to inefficient PCR amplification in all samples.
Data from different array cards were then pooled for further analysis using DataAssist software (Life Technologies).

28 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 1930 and GAPDH for precursor miRNA cards) were used to calculate dCt (DCt) values of a given sample in relative to a selected reference sample.
We found that endogenous genes are expressed differently across various tissues, making them inappropriate as internal controls, so instead of using the internal controls to normalize among various tissues, we used Global Mean normalization [48] to normalize the pooled dataset.
miRNAs were considered undetectable with Ct value P 35 (mature miRNAs) or 40 (precursor miRNAs).
Relative expression levels of mature miRNA or miRNA precursor were presented as fold change over a selected reference sample (e.g., cerebral cortex).
Level of miRNA expression was evaluated using unpaired Student t-test and multiple testing using Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method was applied to correct the reported P values.
P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
