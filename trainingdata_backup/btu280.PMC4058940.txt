To improve assembly quality, recent studies have utilized longer Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) reads or jumping libraries to connect contigs into larger scaffolds or help assemblers resolve ambiguities in repetitive regions of the genome.
However, their popularity in contemporary genomic research is still limited by high cost and error rates.
In this work, we explore the possibility of improving assemblies by using complete genomes from closely related species/strains.
We present Ragout, a genome rearrangement approach, to address this problem.
In contrast with most reference-guided algorithms, where only one reference genome is used, Ragout uses multiple
