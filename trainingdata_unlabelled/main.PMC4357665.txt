In this review, we provided its history of develop-ment, classiﬁcation, and working mechanism of this technology.
We also outlined the screening strategies for DNA polymerases to accommodate the reversible terminators as substrates during polymerization particularly, we introduced the  REAP  method developed by us.
At the end of this review, we discussed current limitations of this approach and provided potential solutions to extend its application.
Dideoxy sequencing method, developed by Frederick Sanger et al. in 1977, contributed substantially to development of biological sciences in the past several decades [1]. As the core technology, it brought the great successful completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) [2]. However, high cost and low throughput inherited within the method had limited its application to meet the ever-expanding appetite for large scale genome sequencing projects, including de novo sequencing of more species, whole-genome resequencing, and deep sequenc-ing. Therefore, the second-generation sequencing technology, * Corresponding author.

Production and hosting by Elsevier characterized by its high speed, high throughput, and lower cost, appeared on the scene [3 5]. Since 2005, the second-generation sequencing technologies have experienced a rapid development: different sequencing platforms came to market and data produced by these new technologies mushroomed exponentially.
These achievements not only provided large amount of raw data for scientiﬁc re-search, but also uncovered new scientiﬁc ideas, and revolution-arily changed our ways of working in life sciences [3 7]. Now, the third-generation sequencers, represented by single molecule real-time sequencer (SMAT) from PacBio [8], are also on the horizon.
But due to the relatively high single read error rate ( 15%) [9], the second-generation sequencing technologies are still the mainstream in whole-genome sequencing markets.
So far, technologies employed in the second-generation sequencing platforms are of two main types based on sequenc-ing chemistry:  sequencing by synthesis  and  sequencing by ligation  [10,11]. Reversible termination sequencing is one of the sequencing-by-synthesis strategies popularized by Illu-mina/Solexa due to its wide adoption in the worldwide sec-1672-0229/$-see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2013.01.003  Chen F et al  Reversible Terminators Used in Gene Sequencing 35 is linked to the oxygen atom of the 30-(capping) group] OH of the pentose, while the ﬂorescence label is linked to the base, which acts as a reporter and can be cleaved [12 18]. The other type is 30-unblocked reversible terminators [19 23] as shown in Figure 1C. In this case, the reversible termination group is linked to the base as well as the ﬂores-cence group which not only is a reporter but also functions as part of the reversible terminating group for termination of the primer extension.
These two types of reversible termi-nators have their advantages and disadvantages: the 30-O-blocked reversible terminator contains a 30 reversible block-ing group, thus should render better termination effect the 30-unblocked reversible terminator, on the other hand, is eas-ier to be accepted by the DNA polymerases due to the lack of a modiﬁed moiety at the 30-OH.
Because polymerases have evolved for billions of years to discriminate between ribonucleoside triphosphates and 20-deoxyribonucleoside tri-phosphates, they have evolved to inspect the 20-and 30-posi-tions of their substrates closely.
For example, although the only difference between dideoxyribonucleoside and deoxyri-bonucleoside is the presence or absence of oxygen atom at the 30 position, accepting a dideoxyribonucleoside for all known DNA polymerases will prevent further catalytic elon-gation of additional nucleoside afterward [17,24]. For the ﬁrst type, there are three commercially-available reversible terminators with a blocking group at 30-OH (structures shown in Figure 2A C): the 30-ONH2 reversible terminator developed by Dr. Steven A. Benner and his col-leagues from Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution (FfAME) [17,18] the 30-O-allyl reversible terminator created by Jingyue Ju and his colleagues from Colombia University [5] the 30-O-azidomethy reversible terminator developed and used by Illumina Solexa [12]. All three commercial reversible terminators were reported to show good performance in reversible termination function: achieving nearly 100% of 30-O blocking efﬁciency and ﬂorescent label group cleavage after primer extension termination [12 18]. For the second type, hitherto, there is only one commercial 30-OH unblocked reversible terminator named  virtual termi-nator , which is developed by Helicos BioSciences Corpora-tion (Figure 2D) and employed by the ﬁrst  single molecule  sequencer to hit the market in the emerging third generation of DNA sequencing platform [19]. In addition, the  Lightning terminator  recently developed by Michael L. Metzker s group also belongs to 30-OH unblocked reversible terminator (the lower panel in Figure 2E), and is unique in using UV light to cleave the ﬂuorescent group [20 23]. Figure 1 nators used in sequencing technologies Structure schematic of irreversible and reversible termi-ond-generation sequencing market (with 80 90% market share) [12]. In the following sections, we give a brief introduc-tion on the developmental history and current status of this technology, discuss the limitations, and suggest potential solu-tions of its uses in detail.
The history and classiﬁcation of reversible termination sequencing technology Reversible termination sequencing technology was ﬁrst re-ported by Dr. Jingyue Ju from Colombia University [13]. The prime difference between this approach and the traditional Sanger sequencing method is that the former uses modiﬁed nucleotide analogous to terminate primer extension reversibly, while the latter employs dideoxynucleotide to irreversibly ter-minate primer extension (Figure 1) [5]. With the development over the last decade, several reversible terminators were produced.
They can be classiﬁed into two types based on the difference of the reversible blocking groups [11 23]. One type is 30-O-blocked reversible terminators.

Working mechanism of reversible termination sequencing technology Reversible termination sequencing technology is a sequencing-by-synthesis approach [3 5] that infers the sequence of a tem-plate by stepwise primer elongation.
It is popularized as a sec-ond generation sequencing technology on the Illumina platform.
The general reversible termination sequencing pro-cess involves (i) immobilizing the sequencing templates and primers on a solid support (ii) primer extension by one base and termination (iii) recognizing the color of the ﬂuorophore carried by the extended base to identify the incorporated nucleotide after washing away the unincorporated nucleotides (iv) removal of the ﬂuorescent tag and the 30-O blocking group (v) washing again and repeating the aforementioned steps (ii iv). The whole process can be summarized as extension termi-nation cleavage extension cycle (Figure 3). Screening proper polymerases for their abilities to accept the reversible terminators After design and synthesis of a reversible terminator, ﬁrst we need to ﬁnd a proper polymerase to accept the nucleotide ana-log.
Due to the speciﬁcity of enzyme and the special structures of the reversible terminating nucleotides, it is difﬁcult to get a proper polymerase to accept them with high efﬁciency and ﬁdelity. Proper polymerases were usually obtained after exper-imenting potential candidates screenings [17,18] (Figure 4). through primer extension Based on screening libraries, two approaches are applied to select the proper polymerases for the reversible terminators [17,18]. One simple approach is to screen the polymerases from commercially-available DNA polymerases and reverse tran-scriptases [18]. If no desired polymerase can be obtained in this screening, another approach can be taken to obtain the proper polymerases from mutation libraries constructed through ra-tional design,  directed evolution  (random mutation), or semi-rational design (combination of rational design with di-rected evolution) [17]. Many commercially-available DNA polymerases, such as Therminator, Klenow, Bst and 9 Nm DNA polymerases, have been reported to work well with the reversible terminating nucleotides [12,15,18,20]. Jingyue Ju s group used AmpliTaq DNA polymerase in their sequencing process (Invitrogen) due to its good compatibility to a large ﬂuorescent group at 50 position of pyrimidine and 70 position of purine [15]. A mu-tant 9 Nm DNA polymerase was adopted by Illumina Solexa, but the mutation sites are unknown due to commercial consid-eration [12]. For the same reason, Helicos did not disclose the DNA polymerase used in their sequencing platform [19]. Lightning terminator  research group screened eight com-mercial DNA polymerases, among which Bst DNA polymer-ase demonstrated the best incorporation efﬁciency for the  Lightning terminator  [20]. In addition, Steven A. Benner et al. found that some reverse transcriptases showed unex-pected compatibility for nucleotide analogs [24].

Such a  conserved but different  site in a protein family is a target for protein engineering.
A kind of semi-rational design strategy, reconstructed evo-lutionary adaptive path (REAP), developed by us, was proved to be a useful tool to genetically engineer the poly-merases to accept the reversible terminator [17]. This strategy is based on the concept of  conserved but different  pattern, introduced by Steven A. Benner et al. more than two decades ago [25,26]. Figure 5 illustrates this concept.
Here, sites are identiﬁed where the residue has not been absolutely con-served in all proteins in the family, but rather conserved with-in sub-branches of the family.
The fact that the residue is conserved in sub-branches of the family means that it is un-der implying its importance for some aspects of enzymatic function.
This, in turn, infers that behavior of the polymerase is likely to change if the residue at the site is modiﬁed. The fact the res-idue is not absolutely conserved, however, means that the site relatively strong functional constraints, Schematic showing sequencing during synthesis using 30-Figure 3 O blocking reversible terminators Each triphosphate has its 30-OH group blocked and a ﬂuorescent tag attached to its nucleobase via a cleavable linker.

Screening the proper polymerases compatible with the reversible terminators using primer extension method Figure 4 c 32P-labeled primer was ﬁrst annealed with the template, followed by the addition of the reversible terminator.
Primer extension was then initiated by adding the candidate polymerases, and evaluated by running the samples on denaturing PAGE gel.

can tolerate some degree of variations without destroying the core functionality of the protein, such as folding or catalytic activity.
Therefore, such  conserved but different  sites are preferred targets for protein engineering in our REAP meth-od. Several of the variant Taq polymerases that accept 30-ONH2 reversible terminator have emerged through the appli-cation of this strategy [17]. The opportunity and challenge of reversible termination sequencing technology The great success of Human Genome Project signiﬁcantly energized the development of more cost-effective sequencing technology [2]. Especially since 2005, the development and  Chen F et al  Reversible Terminators Used in Gene Sequencing 39 application of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, characterized by its low cost and high throughput through massively parallel sequencing, displays an unprecedented tech-nological breakthrough in biology, medicine and many related ﬁelds. Due to various advantages, reversible termination sequencing technology has been widely accepted and used in multiple NGS platforms, including the most successful NGS, Illumina/Seloxa sequencer and the ﬁrst third-generation single molecule [3,4,12,19]. This technology uses ﬂuorescent labels as sequencing reporter, which not only affords great sensitivity and sequencing accu-racy but also markedly decreases the amount of sample re-quired. In addition, the application of reversible termination strategy effectively solves the problem of accurate identifying homopolymeric runs (such as PolyA) which are difﬁcult to achieve using pyrosequencing technology.
It was reported that the reversible termination sequencing could accurately read out more than 18 consecutive A [26,27]. sequencer, Helicos sequencer Although  sequencing using cyclic reversible terminator  brings about new opportunities to the development of sequenc-ing techniques, some problems still exists, among which, short read length has always been a major weakness.
As the most popular NGS platform, the read length of the Illumina/Solexa sequencing platform is only around 100 150 bp (Tables 1 and 2). Drawbacks of short read length in shot-gun sequencing, especially de novo, are obvious.
One of the fundamental reasons for short read length in  sequencing using cyclic reversible terminator  is that revers-ible terminator nucleotide analogs developed so far leave be-hind a vestige ( scar ) after cleavage of the linker carrying the ﬂuorophore. Figure 6 illustrates the accumulation of such scars along the major groove of the DNA duplex after two rounds of sequencing extension on Illumina/Solexa platform.
Accompanied by primer extension, such accumulation of scars snowballed, impairing the stability of DNA double-helix struc-ture adversely and, thus, hindering substrate recognization and primer extension.
Through adding a certain proportion of reversible terminator nucleotide analogs without the ﬂuoro-phore, some base incorporations (e.g., Illumina/Solexa) leave no vestige, alleviating the impact of scars accumulation to a certain extent and extending read length.
However, in order to overcome this deﬁciency thoroughly, new solutions are still a matter with great urgency.
Recently, Metzker and colleagues made some advancement in this respect [20 23]. In their sys-tem, the scar left after cleavage of the linker is very small (Fig-ure 2E), suggesting a potential to completely or at least partially overcome the drawback of short read length in  sequencing using cyclic reversible terminator.
