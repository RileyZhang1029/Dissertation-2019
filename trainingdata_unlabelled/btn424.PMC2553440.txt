Contact: fritz_roth@hms.harvard.edu With the wealth of information available in biological databases has come a proliferation of namespaces , i.e. schemes for naming biological entities (genes, proteins, metabolites, etc.). For example, a single gene might be identiﬁed as IL1RL1 in the HGNC symbol namespace, ENSG00000115602 in the Ensembl gene id namespace, and Hs.66 in the Unigene namespace, while a protein product of that gene might be identiﬁed as NP_003847 in the RefSeq peptide namespace and IPI00218676 within the International Protein Index (IPI) namespace. The lack of standardized gene and protein identiﬁers remains a fundamental hindrance to biological research, and is particularly obstructive to strategies based on integrating high-throughput data from disparate sources (e.g. combining mRNA expression data with protein interaction and functional annotations). A very common task is the translation of an ordered set of identiﬁers from one namespace to another.
The Synergizer is a database, associated with both programmatic and interactive web interfaces, with the sole purpose of helping researchers (both bench scientists and bioinformaticians) perform this deceptively simple task.
The simplest way to describe the use of the programmatic interface is via a short example Perl script (see Fig.1) using the Perl module Synergizer::DemoClient (available for download see Availability above). The key functionality of the Synergizer application programming interface (API) is represented here by the function translate (line 11). When executed, this function generates a remote procedure call in the form of a JSON-encoded object, and sends it via HTTP to   To whom correspondence should be addressed.
a remote Synergizer server.
This server translates the identiﬁers in the ids argument (lines 7 9) from one namespace (here designated as the domain ) to another (designated the range ), using mappings provided by the speciﬁed authority [in this case Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2002)]. These results are returned via HTTP to the script, where they are assigned to the variable $translated as a reference to an array of arrays, one array per original input identiﬁer (since an input identiﬁer may return zero, one or several translations). Some identiﬁers (e.g. pxn in the example) that belong to the domain namespace, but for which no equivalent in the range namespace was found, will return no translations.
To highlight inputs that were not found in the domain namespace (e.g. test ), these identiﬁers are translated to the undefined value.
For further details, please consult the Synergizer API (see Availability above). It is important to note that although the example above is written in Perl, the Synergizer service is language independent (as well as platform independent). The API for the service is publicly available and it is a simple matter to write API-conforming clients in Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, JavaScript or any other modern programming language.
A second illustration of the service is its web front end, (see Availability above), which is itself a Synergizer client application (illustrating the language independence of the Synergizer API, this client is written in JavaScript as opposed to the earlier example in Perl). Although several tools are available to translate biological identiﬁers (for example, see references Bussey et al., 2003 Côté et al., 2007 Draghici et al., 2006 Huang et al., 2007 Iragne et al., 2004 Kasprzyk et al., 2004 Reimand et al., 2007), the Synergizer has some features that will make it particularly useful to bioinformaticians. Perhaps the Synergizer s greatest asset is its simplicity.
It is designed to perform a single task, bulk translation of biological database identiﬁers from one naming scheme (or namespace) to another, as quickly and simply as possible.
The service obtains its information from authorities, such as Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2002) and NCBI (Wheeler et al., 2008), that publish detailed correspondences between their identiﬁers and those used by external databases.
In general, we say that two identiﬁers are synonymous , according to a speciﬁc authority, when the authority assigns them to its same internal identiﬁer. (For brevity, we refer to the authority s internal identiﬁer as the peg.) For example, we would say that, according to authority Ensembl, the identiﬁers IL1RL1 and Q01638  2008 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses by-nc/2.0/uk/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

are synonymous because it assigns both to its internal identiﬁer (peg) ENSG00000141510. For the same reason, 6 01 203 and 5998 are synonymous, but in this second example the synonyms are simple numbers that give no indication of the database of origin.
For this reason, every identiﬁer listed by the Synergizer service belongs to a speciﬁc namespace. In this example, 6 01 203 belongs to the namespace mim_gene_accession, and 5998 belongs to the namespace hgnc_id. More formally, namespace , as we use the term, is a collection of identiﬁers, all generated by the same organization, in a controlled way.
Regarding namespaces, it is worth noting that some providers of biological information follow the practice of prepending a preﬁx to the identiﬁer to indicate the database of origin (e.g. HGNC:IL1RL1), which has the same effect of segregating identiﬁers according to namespace. The Synergizer system generally does not follow this practice.
Also, the identiﬁers discussed until now, which belong to well- deﬁned namespaces, must be distinguished from those that are proposed ad hoc, one-at-a-time, by the researchers who ﬁrst describe them in the literature.
These ad hoc identiﬁers are only within the scope of the Synergizer service where they correspond to a tightly controlled namespace for which some authority offers correspondences to other namespaces. For each authority, Synergizer uses a peg that is speciﬁc to that authority.
For example, for Ensembl currently it is the Ensembl Synergizer service gene id, and for NCBI it is the Entrez gene id.
But the choice of peg for a given authority is an implementation detail that may change in the future.
By this procedure, we generate a repository of synonym relationships between database identiﬁers. When we do this we often ﬁnd discrepancies among various authorities.
The reasons for these discrepancies are varied.
They range from simple time lags between databases, to policy differences among the authorities on the assignment of external identiﬁers to their respective internal identiﬁers, and even to more substantive disagreements, at the scientiﬁc level, on gene assignments.
Rather than attempting to resolve these discrepancies, the synonym relationships served by each authority are kept separate within the Synergizer system.
The Synergizer s schema has been designed to preserve the provenance of all synonym relationships, and to accommodate new sources of synonym information over time.
To access the Synergizer s interactive web interface visit the link listed under Availability above.
To use the interface, simply paste the identiﬁers to be translated in the input ﬁeld (or, alternatively, enter the name of a local ﬁle from which to upload the identiﬁers). Then, choose the domain and range namespaces. It is also possible to specify the special catchall domain namespace __ANY__ (although we note that specifying the domain namespace recommended where possible since it is less prone to ambiguous translation). By default the output is in the form of an HTML table, but there is also the option to obtain the output in the form of a spreadsheet.
Currently the Synergizer supports synonyms from two different authorities Ensembl and NCBI, and holds a total of just over 20 million synonym relations covering over 70 species and over 150 namespaces.
